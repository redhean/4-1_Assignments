1,"I was very excited to learn about this shop from the ""New Times Best Of"".  I ventured in on a Tues. morning and with some difficulty I found someone to help me.  I am a basic knitter and am happy with that.  I bought some merchandise and off I went to knit.

Upon trying to return to expand my knitting three times I have gone to the shop and three times I have not received any assistance.  Once I left work early and arrived at the shop at 3:50, they close at 4.  I went on a Saturday to be told ""there were no knitters there, and to come back on Wed. eve at 5 and the knitters will be there to help me.""  I know exactly what I want to make I just need some assistance.  This eve. is Wed. I went into the shop and there was a knitting class.  I explained I didn't want a class just some assistance.  I was told by the knitting ring leader ""this is my class, $65 for 6 classes, we knit 5-7."" I explained I didn't want to knit i wanted to buy wools and go home and knit.  Four times she repeated herself regarding her class.  I get it is her class and she is not there to assist with questions on the retail level.  What I don't get is who is? 

Volunteer run and charity driven is a primary factor I wanted to support this store.  However I can't seem to give them my money.   I guess if you don't want to be in some sort of cult like stitching class this is not the establishment for you.  It saddens me because the idea is great, the merchandise is beautiful however customer service and assistance is necessary even if you are a bunch of volunteers.

I guess I will find another shop that will assist me by helping  me and take my money."
1,"This is the first restaurant that I have seen that is open until exactly 9:15pm. It is an odd closing time and maybe they were in a rush at 8:45pm packing my to-go order because my two spring rolls at $2 were left out. The dipping sauce for those spring rolls were in there and that ended up getting dumped on the white rice that was included with my noodle dish which is also unusual. So, I tried rice noodles with beef, but rice noodles in this joint are not Singapore style (which I wanted), but instead were chow fun style whic is like american egg noodles basically. The english spoken by the front counter owner was not perfect and she also seemed in a rush to make that crazy 9:15 time a reality. Ok, so the noodles and the onions and scallions in the dish tasted like any other place, but the nasty, unedible and in some pieces uncooked (9:15?) pieces of beef really earned this place its one star. I order beef like once in three years in Chinese places knowing that every place usually sucks and this was no exception. The owner could have mentioned that i could have gotten all veggies, but she didn't when I questioned her and I didn't figure out on the long menu that i could have gotten the same dish for $7.95 with no disgusting beef on the American side of the menu instead of paying a buck more. There must be an asian TV show that starts at 9:30pm or something because I doubt you will ever see a 9:15pm closing time ever again. I think the show is called ""food no Good"""
1,"RUDE AND UNHELPFUL... where do all these great reviews come from... the staff? owner's friends??? I have tried to support this local business 3 times... and each time they have had no interest in making me feel welcome in the shop or answering my questions. I have come in to buy violin parts/accessories for my 8 year old, I don't have any music background or knowledge... could they act slightly helpful? Each time it seemed I was tearing them away from some very important thing they were doing behind the counter. Also, they wanted to sell me a set of violin strings for $87 that I later found out are $60-65 everywhere else in the Valley and on the internet. I will not try a fourth time, believe me, I am sure there are other Valley music stores that will be happy to have my business."
1,"Horrible experience.

We ordered 3 entrees. General Tsos, Chow Mein and the Warer boiled chicken.

The Tsos and Mein were decent at best. The other dish which was recommended as their favorite and is supposed to be spicy came out and it was god awful. It was Water boiled spicy beef.

We told the waitress it was unedible. It was barely spicy and had something in it that numbs your tongue and tasted like novacane. Our tongues were all numb.

No Offer to exchange it for something else. And certainly they were not about to remove it from the tab. 

Bad customer service as far as I'm concerned. 

Tip for the owners this is America, not China. Work on your customer service skills"
5,"Just had the best fresh pressed juice ever for $6 for a huge drink. A great variety of fresh fruits and vegetables squeezed as I watched. Pineapples, beats, apples, cactus, orange.  Delicious.  This drink would've been $12 at a juice shop. 

I stumbled into the shop for some guacamole.  Got some great fresh shrimp ceviche.  What an incredible find!"
1,"Thankfully they're still closed. 

That's it.

That's my update.

Drink Folgers. Drink Sanka. Drink malted battery acid. Just know you're lucky you didn't drink the ""coffee"" here!"
1,"Had a couple of nice times here but my last visit was and will forever be my last visit. Took my wife for Sunday brunch here last summer and it all went horribly wrong. Bad table, bad snooty waitress, disconnected Scottsdale dude who managed the place went through the motions when we walked out prior to getting our main courses. I have never been made to feel like I wasn't welcome somewhere by a server until that time. I told the waitress (who was the cause of 90% of our bad experience) that we were not staying to continue to be treated like this. She suddenly became very worried we were going to ""tell"" on her. It didn't matter much anyway because as soon as I started telling the space-case manager what was wrong, he didn't even let me finish my first sentence before trying to buy my silence with gift cards, etc. I know they are a great looking restaurant and they have good food, but you are NO better than the people you serve, so remember that. Tip: Houston's has  nearly the same menu."
5,"The Costco of pet supplies :-) except that you do not need to pay annual membership fees like you would at C or Sam's Club.  They are open to both business owners and individual consumers. 
One of the vet techs at the Alta Vista veterinary clinic (Jason), mentioned this place when I told him I preferred not to go to places such as Petco or Petsmart since I try to support mostly local businesses for our family and pet needs. 
On our very first visit, I purchased a soft crate, a mattress, a cute outfit, some Zuke's treats, among others. My daughter said ""I am not even a dog and I'm having fun looking at so much dog stuff"" ;-)
Also lots of cat supplies too.
The prices are great. I buy a lot of things for my pets on Amazon and other online sites but if I am in the area, we would definitely stop by here. I will check out their website next."
5,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Middleton. The hostess and servers are friendly, and the food is delicious. Entrees are large and flavorful. Salads are also large and fresh. Salad is not included with an entree, but if you decide to add one to your order, I suggest splitting it. The salad is large enough to be a meal for some folks. 

For an entree, I highly recommend the scampi diavalio. It's a heavenly dish with campanelle pasta, sausage, chicken, shrimp, bell peppers, onions, and olive oil. There are also some red pepper flakes to add a spicy kick, but the spice is definitely not overpowering to my taste. 

Overall, this is a wonderful local restaurant with a cozy, friendly atmosphere and great food. I highly recommend it."
1,Friends don't let friends fly US airways . . . Seriously!! Pay the $10 $20 $50 for a better airline horrible customer service not even offered a food voucher for their mistake that has me here waiting til 641pm got here at 9am o_O
5,"Stumbled across this place while working a photo shoot in the area and we ordered in.  Since then we haven't stopped eating at Athenian Express.   A good five miles out of the way.    What attracted us?  Great food, great prices and the owners wife was undeniable friendly.  Seriously one of the genuinely nicest people I have ever met.   I started out with the Turkey Pita.  Delicious. Yet she urged me to be more creative.   Love it all now including the staff.   There isn't a day where it isn't hussle and bussle in the place,  yet the service is fast and always accurate.  Seriously, I eat it almost every day."
1,@holverson: SCREW YOU Valvoline Instant Oil Change! I schedule a 3 hr appt. & you close without canceling. Make me drive 1 hr w/kids. You suck!! #FAIL
5,"I was so impressed with this body shop. They did great work on my car, dealt with the insurance company and when I picked up my car it was spotless inside and out ( much better than when I droped it off).
I highly recommend them"
1,"Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location.

I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal. When i worked at Mickey D's in the early 90's we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out), from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs. This must not be a practiced any longer.  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response. Then I get someone who is rude and say's yes. I order the big mac deal, buy 1, get 1 for a $1. The employee says they do not offer that, I advise their menu out front does. After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up. Total lack of cust serv service, he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up, no apology or anything. This happened each time I went there. C'mon man"
5,"Coach & Willies is a nicer sports bar with an awesome food menu & is walking distance from Chase Field (really walking distance, as in we managed to walk in 105 degree weather).  The menu is a lot better than most bars & the atmosphere is nicer than most sports bars (aka you can take your parents or kids here & use the bathrooms without being grossed out). I personally really like this place because it's nice to be able to get a real & good meal at a sports bar. We've had:

- Italian Nachos:absolute GENIUS and I can't believe I've never thought of them to make on my own or seen on another menu. This is a must get dish, whether you get the full size as a meal or the half size as an appetizer. It's fried pizza dough that's still soft but firm enough to hold up the toppings, covered in delicious, flavorful marinara sauce topped with gobs of melted mozzarella and pizza toppings. My boyfriend & I are stuck on getting this dish every time.
- Baked Mac & Cheese: Amazing! The cheese sauce is decadent, thick, creamy, and has a wonderful garlic & southwestern spice flavor. 
- Italian Chopped Salad: Okay. The toppings didn't really taste like anything so overall it was an expensive bed of lettuce.
- House Salad: Basic but a good choice to balance out one of the heavier meal options."
5,"These guys are great!  Fast, friendly service and all you need for shipping, printing and more.  Yeah the post office is cheaper on some stuff, but I like the idea of my stuff getting to where it's supposed to on time :-)   Chuck and his staff are great.  Highly recommend"
5,"So good! It's hard to find good mexican food here in Arizona, I'm from California where it runs rampant, but they have delicious food. The staff is really helpful and nice, and don't harass you. The food is always quick, I proabably eat here 2-3 times a month. I moved here a year ago and they had the best ""chicken en mole"" enchilada which was seasonal, I can't wait for them to bring it back!. Outdoor seating in the ARizona center, I love to grab a beer and quick lunch then head over to the movies on my days off. I definately recommend it!"
5,"A few weeks ago, an old friend and I made plans to meet up for lunch. Problem is, I essentially live in North Scottsdale and she is in Buckeye. Using Meetways.com to find a halfway point, I then took the results to Yelp to see what restaurants are in the area (I prefer to find the good local places, rather than a chain, which I'm sure is true for most Yelpers). Anyways, saw the great reviews and decided to check this place out.

We both were unadventurous and ordered chicken teriyaki bowls which were of course delicious as others have said. Very nice portions too as neither of us downed the whole bowl. Where this place really shines, though is the service. An older woman, who I'm guessing must have been one of the owners as someone else mentioned, was walking around conversing with the patrons. It's a small place so she was able to check with everyone on multiple occasions during the time we were there. 

Her service was absolutely delightful. When I received my food first (I had ordered a couple minutes before, so my friend had just finished ordering when I got my meal), she came over to the table and informed that the young lady would not think I was rude if I started eating before she was served. A moment later, she came back with my friend's food as she told us that she ""has pull around here"" lol. I'm guessing that teriyaki bowl was intended for another customer, so sorry about the added wait if that's the case, random stranger. A while later she came back to give us free refills of our large drinks. 

I will definitely be going back when I'm in the area again, and might have to order something different. A wonderful experience that was truthfully what motivated me to actually sign up for Yelp and write a review after years of using the app as an ""outsider""

The only negative was that the parking is very limited, but then again I did go during the lunch rush. My friend was able to get a spot in their lot but I wound up having to park in a different lot just north of it. It was maybe only 30 feet further away, I just wasn't sure if I would be towed or not."
1,"Gross! I ordered a turkey sandwich. Just awful. The bread was falling apart and hard, the meat tasted terrible, like plain ol' lunch meat. Overpriced and definitely not worth it. Don't waste your time or money!"
5,"Great little shop off of the interstate. I was looking for a place to go that wasn't fast food and wasn't the same old-same old. I was surprised how much I liked this place. Made to order deli-sandwiches, cheese, fudge, a New Glarus beverage and Southern Comfort? Yes, Southern Comfort. True one stop shopping. I will make this a regular stop between Elgin and Minnesota!"
5,"My absolutely most favorite-est place for lunch.  I'm not really into wraps - so that's not what I eat here.  But it's the best Greek salad (get it with chicken) I have ever had, and when I worked down there, I used to get it 2-3 times per week, split it in half, and have the second half for lunch the next day. Oh, and the other thing.... I am WAY picky about chicken. I usually end up picking off half the chicken from any salad, because I'm a purist.  If you're anything like me, you'll have no problem here.  Not to mention, this is the only place I know that carries Zevia - soft drinks made with the herb stevia - no sugar, no artificial MS, cancer-causing crapola."
5,"I love this place!  it's a cultural experience!  I think even if you are Mexican, this place delights all the senses!

I love the tortilla department!  36 freshly made yellow corn tortillas for $2.50!!! 

the ladies at the meat dept were fantastic!

The wall of spices, herbs, and chilis was incredible.

I did not have enough time to sit and eat there but that's the plan for the next trip.

I came home and made shredded beef tacos with all the fixings.

My rec is come and linger and enjoy the sights and then have a great lunch either at the food court or at the restaurant next door."
5,"The Van Gogh exhibit is very much worth seeing. Floor to ceiling video display of his works, with some floor panels exhibiting video as well. 

Each wall, of which there are many in this maze of an exhibit has video playing. This means that although there are people wandering through, you'll be able to glance left or right and see the video on another wall. Obviously, the more crowded the museum, the more difficult to see, but it only takes about 30 minutes for the video to complete it's cycle.  You can stay and see the parts you may have missed as it starts over on a continuous loop. 

On exit, you can buy a book and video. I don't recommend the video, it seems to have been shot while the exhibition was open to the public so you have people wandering through the DVD scenes as it's being filmed. It's not so much that they obscure the view, it's just simply too distracting. 

If you're a member it's only $8 for the exhibit, slightly more if you're not a member. Go, it's worth it. 

It's OK for teens but the younger children we saw there were bored to the point of being somewhat disruptive."
5,"Spartan Animal Hospital is a fantastic place. I am a seriously poor college grad and I took my new cat (from the shelter) to Spartan for her rabies and FVRCP booster shots today. I was really impressed with the staff and the facility. The people were extremely friendly and were patient and willing to answer all of my questions. They gave me a folder full of good information and the home phone number of Dr. C, the owner, in case of non-office hour emergencies. That's dedication.

The best part about Spartan is that they don't charge the regular office fee if you're just coming in for vaccinations! It's a rare thing to be pleasantly surprised at a cash register, isn't it?

I highly recommend Spartan to you!"
1,"Delivery was quick. However the pizza was like cardboard with burned cheese, and bland. I ordered a 2 liter soda pop online, and was told by the delivery driver that they were out and would give me a credit for next time i ordered from them. That was unacceptable, as i am never ordering from them again. The delivery driver did not understand my frustration with that and was rude and condescending when i complained."
5,"So, whenever you have a California gurl in a Mexican Restaurant, it has to be good.  My weary tummy has not had anything substantial all day, and having read the best of the best about the amazing La Tolteca, I decided to let me feet hit the street & check out this local flor in the rough.  Well, I have to say the reviews are all TRUTH.  
The green enchilada's were my choice as I've not ever been huge fan of the red sauce, in addition to a full range of all that one could feast your immediate appetite too, there is also fresh tortillas, candy, the bakery which is a temptation I did avoid (thank you P90X) and yes, I did say it, the temptation is the BAKERY,  the smells hit your nose before you even step in, yeast, sugar and spices, La Raza!  
Enjoy your time, don't rush, I wandered around and grabbed my favorite Fanta to connect the true flavors of home, Cali and my youth, thanks for the great time La Tolteca, and you'd better be sure that I'll be stopping in again with re-inforcements.   
Gracias & Happy Eating"
1,"I was in the market for a black floral embossed belt (no giant buckle) I knew exactly what I wanted, but wanted to try it on first, and possibly support a local business rather than order one over the internet. Granted I do not look like the typical type of person who might frequent this establishment as; I'm white, I was wearing Lucky Jeans, a Locoste shirt, Chuck Taylors, and a Cardinals hat (I don't know how one would classify that look, I certainly didn't think criminal intent when I was dressing that morning).

I walked in, scanned through the assortment of belts by the door, and then at the belts behind the counter, they were all slightly more ""attention grabbing"" than I was looking for. I was asked if I needed help by the young lady at the register, I replied that I was good, I then walked out and got in my car to drive away. It was at this point that a large man rushed out the door behind me grimacing and angrily staring at my car as he wrote my license plate down. I put my car in reverse and asked him if I had done something wrong, he replied they had been robbed and I told him I had no criminal intent I was just looking for a belt. This didn't seem to placate the beast as he aggressively informed me he was forced to do this (like almost accusing me of being a potential robber and trying to intimidate me against the course of action).

I don't know if this is the policy for all their customers or just any gringo's foolish enough to think they would be welcomed in this establishment. However the encounter was quite unsettling and I really would recommend you avoid this store unless you want to be made to feel like a criminal for no reason. Also for the record, I'm a medical professional and I make $30 an hr, THE LAST THING on my mind was robbing or stealing. Silly belts and supporting the local economy yes; robbing and stealing no."
5,Tucked away on the north side of Madison. I've driven past it thousands of times but went there yesterday on a recommendation from a friend of mine who knows his BBQ. Soooooo gooooooood. I had the pork shoulder sandwich. The baked beans were pure flavor country. I wish everything I ate from here on out could be drizzled in that BBQ sauce. Service was pretty quick and the prices were not bad either. I'll be coming back again.
1,"A terrible experience all around, it took forever to get our drinks, and it took around 50 minutes to get our food even though the place was not that busy. On top of that the manager was having a discussion with the servers near the kitchen door because the servers were complaining about the cook having an attitude (couldn't that be done somewhere besides the dining area?) and being slow. Our server had an attitude the entire time as well, and even heard him complain about getting new customers and not wanting to clear off the tables next to us. 

Negative experience all around, our food was OK but everything else was not pleasant to say the least."
1,"I would never recommend this place to anyone. I was flat out lied too. They do not respect their customers and will tell you anything to take your money. If you are going here, bring someone that knows what they're talking about. Never go here if you don't know know about cars because they'll replace things that don't need to be replaced and do a horrible job doing so. I wish I could give them 0 stars."
5,"After taking my tea cup yorkie, Zoe, to Dr. Nothnagel, I will go nowhere else. He is very good with her and very knowledgable. I felt comfort knowing that she would be in Sandhill Pet Clinics care. Coming from Zoe, thank you thank you thank you !!!!"
1,"No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile. 
A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually, two coworkers did.
However, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.

Yes, mold.

Sorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.

Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.

*ETA
MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive."
5,Wtf!!! Superb!!!! 1/2 rack w beans and Apple sauce!! In Wisconsin!! No wonder they won all the awards!! Ask for the G.A.D's!! Wish they had this in Cali!
5,"If you understand the differences between absolute and program music and can deliver a dissertation on Baroque, Classical, and Renaissance styles then good for you. Drop me an email because some of it is completely over my head and skip this review because it's not for you. 

If your looking for something different, a brief respite to rip you away from the grind and let your mind wander formlessly amid the music then check out the symphony. Despite popular belief there is no formal dress code however you might find a favorable response from your fellow patrons if you wear a shirt and shoes after all this is the symphony not the South. Though some people wear jeans you may feel more comfortable in a pair of slacks or casual business attire but ultimately who cares you paid for a ticket just like everyone else. Largely, the only complaint I can muster are the somewhat cramped seats in Phoenix Symphony Hall. Intermissions usually offer a coffee and cocktail bars. Also make sure and arrive slightly early, while they might not care about how you're dressed, etc. I promise you they absolutely will not let you to the hall after the doors close, you will be stuck in the lobby until the intermission.
  
Downtown Phoenix and the other symphony venues also offer a variety of wonderful places to dine before or after the performance. The Phoenix Symphony website www.phoenixsymphony.org offers additional information, performance calendars, and ticket sales. Unplug and give it a try."
1,"Overpriced and dirty.  Had lunch here with my wife and service was ok but salad they served was stale and moldy.  Ordered a raisin croissant, looked and tasted like it was about 4 days old which surprised us they would serve and charge for that.  Probably won't go back since there are better options in the area, scratch, chez vous, ect."
1,"THE RULES:

1. To buy or be helped with anything, you must check in with an ""orange shirt"" - this person has the clipboard and will write your name down with the reason for your visit. 

2a. If you have questions or want to buy something, you must then wait for a ""blue shirt"" to come help you - expect at least a 5 minute wait

2b. If you've made an appointment for the ""genius"" bar, you must wait in back for your name to be YELLED out by a ""genius"" in a black shirt - expect at least a 15 minute wait (If you haven't made an appointment for the ""genius"" bar, you'll probably just get laughed at)

3. If you want to purchase an item, a ""blue shirt"" will check you out with their hand-held device, when available. (There is only one ""register,"" a computer pos system located at the ""genius"" bar, but it's use is ""not encouraged."") If you bring cash or want a bag, expect a longer check out because those are kept somewhere else, of course. Receipts can be emailed to you, printed out, or both.


I wish I would've known these things before my last visit - I would've gone elsewhere or just gone online. Can't tell you how much I hated the experience. I guess the setup is good if you're someone who needs a lot of assistance, but for someone with a simple purchase or quick question, the hassles and hoops of this store isn't worth the inconvenience."
1,"I went into this Michael's with two items to return. I noticed that there was only one cashier and a line 5 people deep, but luckily there was an employee behind the service desk. As I stood waiting to talk with her I realized the people she was talking to were not customers but two other employees, and the three of them were bitching about a customer who had wanted to make a return and how annoying she had been. Then one of them (Nancy) noticed me standing there, turns around and says to me ""you're making a return? you can get in the regular line."" seriously? did you really just suggest that your conversation is so much more critical than helping a customer that I should go wait in another line? that's very interesting Nancy, thanks. Meanwhile the other two don't even look at me, including the one manning the service desk. what the hell?!

I walk over to the one open register and wait for about 15 minutes while this one cashier works through all the people ahead of me. And I kid you not, when I was one person away from freedom, Nancy noticed that there were 3 people behind me, opened up a register and told the woman BEHIND ME to come over. 

Frankly I think all three of those employees should be fired for wasting Michael's and my time while getting paid. I'm sure they make crap pay but that is no excuse for flagrant laziness. It has cost Michael's my business."
1,"Do you like it when your bowels want to explode?  Then this is the place for you.  The sad thing is, the aroma coming from the restaurant is hypnotizing as it drifts through the neighborhood, and the staff is really nice, but holy jeebus, does the pizza suck.  Every time we went there we spent the rest of the night in the bathroom.  Awful."
1,"Be warned gluten.... Went for happy hour expecting to have GF food. Postinos said they could do gluten-free before we were seated.
Come to find out they could only do olives truly gf once they found out it was a true allergy. 
We were told by several different people that many items were gluten free; such as the sandwiches, but upon further questions about the meats, cheeses, etcetera being GF, they took back their reassurances. Close call to being poisoned!"
1,Today is the last time I will ever order steak and eggs at the 5 & Diner.  This is the third time in a row where the steak just sucked.  Not even eatable.  The server (Carlos) is nice and does what he can but it's not enough.  Carlos told me he tells his boss but nothing changes.  Well now I'm telling whoever runs that place that your breakfast steak is not worth serving let along to pay $12 for it.  Unfortunately you will never have a chance to get me back even if you solve the problem.
1,This place is not there anymore.
1,"I really would love to give a better rating to a vegan restaurant. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with EVERYTHING. 
1. I waited 40 min for a take out (with only 2 occupied tables at that time)
2. A guy who ordered after me got a free piece of cake for the long wait. (it wasn't offered to me) 
3. Terrible service 
4. The decor is something you see in senior houses in Sun City
5. Almost all items on the menu have soy protein.. TVP? Is it really something healthy or it's some sort of cardboard pretending to be food?
6. They packed my to go order in such a way that the soup turned before I got to my car, soaking thru the paper bag, landing on my pants, and on the sidewalk...  I went inside to tell them that- NO apology, NO money back. 

I wonder why they are not closed yet."
5,"Thanks for making a great trip even better - quick, caring service and a free upgrade to a great Jeep Patriot that we really enjoyed. Enterprise is all I've used for years and I don't see myself ever changing. Rare that service in your business is this good."
1,"I want to like this place.

I really, really want to like it. I'm always on the lookout for a local joint that is special, a place I can take out-of-towners and say, ""This is one more thing I love about Phoenix."" I had high expectations for SunUp since it is in my neighborhood, a short ride or healthy walk away from home

But after several visits over the last couple of months and as many disappointments, SunUp Brewing is on my list of places I might go if I'm desperate, not as a destination, and certainly not a place I want representing my city to friends from elsewhere.

I'm no beer aficionado, but I know what I like, and for the most part I like the brews at SunUp. I particularly enjoy the Light Rail Pale Ale as a mild-bodied thirst-quencher, and the Vanilla Porter, which is rich without being too sweet or heavy. I also like seeing what seasonal offerings they have, many of which I enjoyed.

One constant on my many visits, however, is the truly bad customer service. I don't care if you make minimum wage or six figures; if your job is to take orders and serve people, then do it. Many other Yelp reviewers indicate they have suffered lackadaisical customer service at SunUp, and my experience is that this is the rule, not the exception.

Take today, for example: At 1 p.m. on a Sunday, the place was virtually empty save for about three tables and a couple in the main bar area. The last problem I thought I'd have would be getting attention, but my disinterested server/bartender pulled a disappearing act after pouring my beer and plopping my burger in front of me. She was more interested in sitting in a booth in the adjacent room with a paper in front of her, watching TV.

If she had bothered to follow up with her customer, she would've learned my burger was the opposite of the medium-rare burger I ordered. Even more aggravating was when she did walk quickly past me (including one time when she told the other server she as heading out back, presumably for a break), she looked directly at my barely touched meal but didn't inquire as to why I wasn't eating it. I'm not going to chase down a server, especially if it involves going room to room to find her. All she had to do was notice I hadn't touched my meal for 20 minutes and ask if everything was OK.

I've had similar experiences with the staff at SunUp before although this example was the most egregious. Like other reviewers, I've waited at the bar either with a growler ready to be filled or a bill I'm trying to pay while the bartender chatted with friends even after acknowledging me.

It shouldn't be this hard to find a place that wants to sell me something, but evidently the folks at SunUp have more cash than they need, so I see no reason to spend mine there again."
5,"Dined here 200+ times. 

**My parents have been dining here for three decades - my review is prejudiced.  

Rosita's is the anti-Macayo's.  

As the above asterisks indicate, Rosita's is my ""Best Mexican Restaurant in Phoenix."" I cringe at the use of the word ""authentic"" when discussing cuisine, so it won't be used here.  What I can say to supplant that generic word is that their food is unapologetically spicy, they don't cater to vegetarians or finicky diners, and their entire operation - from service to the ""security guard"" in the back - is unpretentious.  

I've known the most of the staff for my entire life, and for what they might lack in their eagerness to interact to the common diner, they make up in genuineness. 

Please Have - machaca plate, green chile burro/chimi, albondigas, chips and salsa.

5,"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. I've been coming here since opened and it is consistently the best. Breakfast all day, more than just burgers and fries, deserts, beer selection....I can't rave enough.

The meatloaf of the Gods is to die for and their Just Coffee roast (their own blend) is so amazingly good I have my mom buy it and send it up to me in Minneapolis. It's that good.

Some of the people that work there have been there since I was a kid. Its a neighborhood place where you're bound to run into people you know and I make a point to go there at least twice while I'm home to visit.

Yay Monty's!"
5,I came here following a student. On trial basis. It's kind a small place but very calming....havnt figured out why yet.  You feel spoiled here. I only get my hair done here but planning to use other services soon. I noticed that other clients as well get great personal services here. It's nice to see men come here as well.
1,"I order it for my employees occasionally.  The pizza is what you expect, nothing better than OK.  They throw on an extra $1.50 for delivery charge and the drivers tell us that most goes directly to the managers pockets.  That Sucks."
5,Love it!!!!! Love it!!!!!! love it!!!!!!!   Who doesn't love Culver's!
5,"Great location if staying near the convention center or in downtown Phoenix. This is by far one of the best sports bars I have ever been to. I had a perfect view of ESPN 2 and the place had plenty of sporting events on other teles..but not too many. 

The atmosphere is fantastic and perfect for lunch. Food is great and they had vegetarian options, a major plus for a sports bar. What is better than veggie options? They made exceptions for me, my whole meal sans dairy with no complaints, evil eyes, etc. This is greatly appreciated. 

The evening scene is great also. 

An overall 5.5 stars. hellz yeah."
1,"You, sir, are not a Ritz-Carlton. When I first walked in, it impressed. It had tasteful, old school decor and helpful people at every turn. The problems started when one of the people in our party had his card declined at check-in (not for the room cost because those were already covered, but for the incidentals). I am told that this decline was not his fault and I would certainly believe him as this is not the type of man who runs up his credit cards. Either way, the hotel staff should have asked another one of us for our cards, but for some reason they just stubbornly kept trying to run the same card for 5 minutes. This was while the rest of us waited, twiddling our thumbs. Oh, yes and we were already running late so this was very annoying. Finally, a manager came over and said that they would figure it out later. Well, within 10 minutes when we were finally in our room, here comes a call on the room phone telling us to come down as soon as possible and put a card on file. Ummm, okay. And why couldn't they just ask when we were just down there???? The room did not impress and was in fact so terribly run down that even the marble in the bathroom had rusted in spots and the pipes under the sink were corroded and leaking. Really, supposed ""Ritz-Carlton""? But here it is, people. Probably the most rude thing that I have ever experienced from a hotel W down to La Quinta: I went to the front desk to ask for a razor and shaving cream. The woman at the desk very helpfully and condescendingly directed me to the tiny gift shop closet where she said they sell it. So, here I was expecting to pay $12 for some crappy bic and a tiny bottle of foam. But no, I guess they were out of them because none was to be found. When I came out of the shop-closet she asked if I found it. I said no, there wasn't any in there. She replied oh, well I will see if room service can bring one to your room. Now, that's odd. When I went to my room, housekeeping was just outside the door. I asked if they might have a shaving kit and the maid rolled her eyes, dug around in her cart and handed me a ""ritz carlton"" official box with a razor and tube of cream inside. For...real... What terrible, money-grubbing, uncouth service! So, yeah. Perhaps consider staying here if you like to be treated like trailer trash who is not nearly good enough for their moldy, falling apart hotel. But, then again I think there is a W nearby. Paris prices for Arkansas accommodations."
1,"It's amazing to me that a bar of this size, next to all of the major venues in downtown Phoenix wouldn't try a little harder to service customers. After attending the Roadrunner's game on Saturday night a group of us went for drinks and to meet the players. After a while, we took a walk down the street to see what was happening at Cooper's, nothing, so we decided to go back into Jackson's. My boyfriend was abruptly stopped by the bouncer who wouldn't let him due to his attire (Hmmm, a hockey jersey is inappropriate attire for an apparent sports bar after a game, wtf???) so he asks to speak to the manager, the bouncer said he was the guy in charge and still wouldn't let us in. Well the bouncer became very rude and aggressive after being POLITELY asked 3 times to speak to the manager then he pulled out pepper spray and threatened him!! Are you kidding me??!! We were just in there 5 minutes ago, coming back to spend more money and this is what goes on? I'm pretty sure someone got this on their camera phone and it doesn't end here. 
I will NEVER go back in there again and will make sure ALL of my friends don't go either. What a joke. 
Oh yeah, and the bar tender tried to double charge us for food. Nice service. My advice, go anywhere for pre-post game drinks but here."
5,"Honest, well-priced service! I'm so glad I found them because working with Chapman BMW is a nightmare! Bavarian even gave me instructions over the phone on how to change the battery in my keyless entry remote when Chapman wanted my vin number just to let me know if it was possible to change the battery. Thank you, Bavarian Motors!"
5,"Simply the best! Kayla, Angie and the entire staff always offer excellent customer service. As a business traveler, this is my favorite to stay at. The rooms are clean, quiet and up to date. The lobby area is inviting and fun place to work and have a drink after a long day!"
1,"My experience with this Walgreens is slightly different from Brad's.  I had oral surgery yesterday and I went in to the store because there was 6 cars waiting for the drive-thru and this is the only pharmacy even close to my house.  After waiting in line 10 minutes just to drop off my prescription, the guy could notice I was in a great deal of pain and said he'd get my prescription filled within 15 minutes.  I decided to sit in the waiting area and suffer in silence.

First off, I can't believe the authorities allow them to sell medical supplies, treat patients (they have a little doctor's office in back) or fill prescriptions here.  This place is a disgusting mess.  There were 3 chairs available for me to sit in, one had garbage on it, one had what I can only describe as a ""snail trail"" on it and one was tucked in the corner under some advertisements and next to the busy staff door.  After wedging myself into the only ""clean"" chair I started the long painful wait at Walgreens.  Once I left the store, I wanted to take off all my clothes in the parking lot and burn them right there.  I had the worst case of the heebeegeebees and didn't want to take that filth home with me.  ewwwww!!!  

Now, I understand that they're busy and that other people too are in pain or need meds urgently.  I also understand that they have no control over the wackos that they let in the door and that they can't shut up that kid who is screaming and throwing a fit.  But they could at least, at very minimum, be somewhat accurate with how long they tell you it'll be.  I wouldn't have waited if they told me it was going to take 40 minutes.  I don't think I would've waited if they told me 20 minutes.  And from here on out, I won't wait at all, no matter my condition. 

Does anybody know of a good locally owned pharmacy???"
5,I loved the whole experience.  Old people like it here too.  Soup was bacon cheeseburger chowder.
5,"Donuts are the source of more smiles than both rainbows and unicorns.  Combined.  I read that somewhere on the ol' interweb... and dangit, I believe it.  Especially if those donuts are from Rainbow.

Maple bacon, whipped cream filled, toasted coconut, chocolate cake with coconut shavings.  Those are just a few of the magical flavors that the wizards at Rainbow have concocted with their wizardry.    

Everyone, put your hands up in the air and say it with me now... RAINBOW DONUTS, WOO HOO!"
5,"This place is HUGE.

I was here for Wrestlemania Fan Axxess and it was on the bottom level, which requires you going down 2 separate escalators just to get to.  The entire complex is shiny and huge and amazing.  Of course, it's $3 for a bottle of water but they know they're gonna get you when once you're in, you can't leave again, and you know you're gonna be thirsty after walking around for 4 hours or so."
5,A great place to stay if your in town for a game. Within walking distance of everything. The rooms aren't that bad either.
1,"Everytime I come here some ""customer"" is always running out this store with a unpaid item."
5,"My favorite Modified memories:

-Piebald.  Super fun!
-The last Suicide Nation show with Jeromes Dream, Usurp Synapse, and Racebannon.  Seriously some of the most intense sets ever.
-Love Life and Get Hustle.
-Getting drunk outside while my friend thought he gave a homeless person his car keys in a handful of coins from his pocket.  After breaking his passenger window with a brick, he found them in THE GLOVE BOX.  Who puts their keys in the glove box?!
-More recently, any time I walk through it now during First Friday to see some (usually) wonderful artwork.

I hope Modified never goes anywhere.  I've got some iffy memories too that are mostly tied to how sketchy the surrounding neighborhood used to be, but it is incredible to see how much it has come along."
1,Mexican pizza tasted like chemicals. The beef in the burritos were awful tasting. Pretty much everything we ordered was terrible. Don't even stop here.
5,Love this group of practitioners and the care provided.
5,"One of my favorite places in town for breakfast. 
It's quick (once you're seated).
It's greasy (like breakfast from a skillet should be).
It's no-nonsense (hash, taters, eggs).
It's served with a smile (and usually some awesome conversation).
Is it super local? Super sustainable?
No.
It's a diner. 
But a delicious one.
And there are planes!"
1,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the food, as the overwhelming smell of sewage forced me to leave before I could order. We instead went next door to ""On the Grill"""
5,Just got back from having breakfast with the girls! It rocked! Excellent breakfast! Two of us had the scramble special & one had a scone - to die for! Great atmosphere! Easy place to meet family & friends and/or work! I'll be going back very soon! :)
5,"We stayed at the Hotel San Carlos this past Memorial Day weekend during the Phoenix Comicon and not only is the hotel beautiful and rich with history but the staff is AMAZING! 

There were 5 of us checking in and we had a small room that was going to be tight but we were going to make it work when the girl behind the counter let us know that the suite was available and it had more room. She offered us a good deal compared to their normal pricing but we were all a little tight on funds so we were nervous about upgrading. She asked the manager to come over and after chatting with all of us for a few minutes (she was so super sweet and informative about the history of the hotel and an absolute pleasure to speak with) she worked some kind of wonderful magic and brought the room down to a killer deal that was completely mind blowing. All of us were so excited because not only did each of us now have a bed to sleep in, but it was going to save us money so that we had a bit more to spend at the Con. 

The room had a separate living room with a couch bed, desk, chair, and foot stool. The bedroom had 2 full-size beds and a nice desk. The view was of downtown PHX and it had 2 nice-sized closets and 2 bathrooms! This was perfect for 3 girls and 2 guys since we all had to get ready at the same time. 

The hotel is beautiful. The lobby is quaint and well appointed. Obviously being a historical landmark it is older and smaller than the gigantic contemporary resorts that many of us are now used to, but it's so much better in many ways. It was warm and friendly and felt like a loved one's home. Honestly I would stay there again anytime. 

There is talk about it being haunted but I didn't get a scary vibe from the hotel at all. I will say that without knowing anything about the haunting history I did step onto the elevator by myself to go up to my room and all of the sudden I smelled some sort of fruity  perfume smell that was not present when I first got into it and the elevator which was set to go up took me down to the basement even though the B button was not pushed and my room was on the 5th floor. The doors opened revealing the basement and I said ""Hello?"" There was no one around. It kind of creeped me out a little bit later when I found out more about the history of the hotel and it's haunting stories. 

I highly recommend the Hotel San Carlos for those of you who appreciate history and don't mind a hotel with character. 

Oh and the parking isn't awful. It's just a little jot up the street which for those of you who don't mind walking a short ways, is just fine. If you do mind walking, they have valet."
1,"Great food I love the encore sandwich but the service is a joke..I am not sure quite what the deal is...but it's like the people behind the counter are bothered by customers...(Indian school location) They just they are too cool and the bankers hours are a joke...! Honestly the sandwiches are good but the ""too cool"" attitude needs to stop and they need to realize the customers are what keep them in business...."
5,Love love love Blue Fin. The staff are the nicest people ever. I love the Panko fish bowl.
5,I have been a food fight customer and visit all of there restaurants on a regular basis. My favorite is Monty's blue plate. The meatless loaf of the gods is my favorite. Have tried other things and have always been happy. Every year they sell gift certificates and for every one hundred dollars they give you a twenty five dollar certificate. Can't beat that. I load up a gift card with five hundred and eat all year. I would never agree with the people that have bashed their places. Try it you will like it.
1,"Went to get my brakes changed from a slight squeak.  They told me that I had a crack and that I was leaking brake fluid and that it would be a safety issue for about $350 more than I planned to spend.  I was shocked as my car had just been inspected a month prior with no problems, and my brakes didn't feel mushy at all.  They strongly urged me to not take my car without doing the repair because I wouldn't know when my brakes might fail and I'd be unable to stop.  I was really anxious, but needed to get a second opinion before spending that much money

Decided to take my car to my regular mechanic who said there was nothing wrong.  Saved myself $350."
1,"I've taken hot yoga from many studios in Phoenix, and this is by far the WORSE.

I'm pretty sure the instructor Dawn has A.D.D. She couldn't seem to focus on the class. The class was in shambles. Everyone of doing different positions, it was ridiculously unorganized. Dawn would start counting down a pose, then forget about the class and start doing her own moves in the mirror, then remember about us and start counting down again at a totally different number.

She'd put us in a pose, then start random chatting with people, and totally forget about us. It was a total waste of time. Speaking of time....the class is scheduled for 1hr/25min. I think the class is soo long to schedule in Dawn's day dreaming. The class started almost 10 minutes late, and went WAY OVER 1hr/25mins. I was ready to scream! Thank god I only went there on a $20 coupon. I'm never going back."
5,I went here for a WWE Raw showing in 2012. We didn't have to wait too long and got in pretty fast. People were helpful to show us where to go. The snack bar was alright- I wasn't a fan of the nachos and I am a HUGE nacho person. They do sell snacks and drinks during the show as well. Overall very happy with the place.
5,"This place is OUTSTANDING! It is the perfect location to meet up with friends or go to by yourself. The noise level is perfect not too loud.. not to quiet. Plus, besides the great selection of drinks (especially sugar-free) they also have a wide selection of food unparalleled to starbucks or caribou. 

Happy Sipping!"
1,"I've eaten here many times in the past few years, and the food was always fabulous.  Not so this last time.  The food was AWFUL.  I assumed that Johnny Chu was still the chef, so I emailed him to ask him what was up with the food, only to find out that he is no longer there, which may explain the awful food.  After having eaten here seven or more times, I won't be back."
5,"On vacation and this place was across the street. The guy who helped me was very nice. He carried on conversation and reccommeded places I should try in the area while visiting. I wish I knew his name to put on here. He spoke english and lived in North Carolina at one time. Anway, prices were good and service"
1,"Going down hill fast and signs of stopping! Sorry I have not reviewed this joint sooner. I have been going to Deemo's since they first opened at the Esplanade. The food and the service used to be fantastic! The Portabello mushroom burger was my fav! Now they can't get nothin right. 

The last time I had the burger it was different they swear its the same meat and everything but my taste buds don't lie. This burger was awful, maybe even freezer burnt. The huge mushroom was the best part. 

I tried the Philly cheese recently and um I really to prefer to have meat on my sandwich! This was the sorriest Philly steak ever! Barely to bites of meat all bread and not good bread either! 

Their crab cakes are awesome but the last time I got those they were under cooked and had bits of shell in them YUCK! 

Today I ordered eggs over medium and crisp bacon. I got eggs over easy and under cooked precooked bacon that was so thin you could see through! All this for 6.17! Plus tax! This is bad eggs and really bad bacon! YUCK!

Don't bother dropping in here for the free app unless you go for the crab cakes and then leave. Just not what they used to be and it just keeps getting worse.

Also on a side bar the service has gone way down hill to. The servers are not very bright here at least the ones I have come across over the past couple years."
1,"I reviewed these idiots back in July and filed a Better Business Bureau complaint against them.  

The empty platitudes from Heather at Danny's corporate that they do a great job for a good price ... Really?  20+ dollars for a VIP wash and the back is not vacuumed, the windows are streaky, there are still bugs all over the grill and hood?  

Offering me a ""free"" crappy carwash  or try and intimidate me when I point out the car is not clean is no offer at all.  I do not feel safe patronising this business at this location.  Maybe someone has had good service from another location but stay away from this one.

I actually never expected to get a refund as these folks have over and over demonstrated they DO NOT CARE when you attempt to bring something to their attention. They have the worst customer service I think I have ever experienced anywhere and getting your car washed there is a complete waste of time and money.  They do a crappy job, and you may get items stolen from your car or something broken on your vehicle and they will say it's not their fault.

Los Olivos Car Wash charges 20 dollars for a hand washed car that is immaculate and the staff is pleasant, friendly and honest. Go to Los Olivos and see for yourself.  You will never settle for the inferior work and service at Danny's ever again.

I will post my most scathing review of this horrible business everywhere I can.  Someone will see it and Danny's will NOT get the business of another unsuspecting fool like me.

Read the other reviews on this place.  It's stay away or you are throwing your money away plus you'll get intimidated or insulted for your trouble."
1,"Horrible experience.  We took into consideration this is a venue that at pre-game becomes overwhelmed with an influx of customers in a short period of time.  However that does not excuse the staff for putting a table of 2 on a waiting list only to forget about them for 45 minutes while tables are cleared and other guests are seated.  When we went back to check the status, the response was ""oops, sorry your information was not transferred from the iPad"" (apparently there was some type of technology glitch).  The response was then that we would be next, so let the wait begin some more.  When our pager did activate, we were given an option to have a view (which would require an additional wait) or be seated immediately.  We stated we would like a view but as we had now been waiting for nearly an hour didn't want to have another unreasonable wait for the view.  Apparently that response translated into ""seat these 2 in the darkest corner of the restaurant with absolutely no chance of even a glimpse of the field"".   After we were seated and realized that we could now be sitting inside any other TGIFridays (surrounded by solid red walls) the other guest in my party then returned to the hostess stand to inquire if maybe a better table with a view was coming available as we were celebrating a birthday (we did not use this line to play on sympathies, it was a birthday occasion - not that it mattered because there were no sympathies).  The hostess then said she would come find us and knew where we were currently seated, only to never be seen or heard from again.  The unapologetic attitude, the unwillingness to make reparations for an obvious oversight and error on the staff's part, and the poor food quality have me hoping this place closes their doors as so many other TGIFridays across the Valley already have and will hopefully be reopened by a restaurateur that knows customer service, food quality, and overall restaurant management (my vote - Four Peaks!).  

As far as the food is concerned, it is what you would expect from a mass produced, crowd fulfillment perspective.  I sympathize with the cooks that are trying to appease the masses, but during our extended wait period we had the opportunity to watch customer after customer complain about the food quality and send items back (in particular there seemed to be an overall dislike for the burgers, which appeared to be frozen meat slabs with no originality to the toppings that would have at least helped to mask the gray color and rubbery texture - yuck)"
5,"I hang my head in shame that I did not make this my go-to Teriyaki joint sooner. 
I knew of it, I remember eating it at the Matsuri Festival years ago, but for some reason I just did not bother to stop into the restaurant.
I'm so glad I did, I now make the drive down Central ave at least once a week to get my fix.  Food is fresh and plentiful. Staff are insanely nice. 
And they don't mess around.
You will literally get a PILE of chicken in your bowl. Delicious, hot, steamy, falling-out-everywhere chicken. A mountain of chicken, if you will. 
I hate that they're not open on the weekends, but I just couldn't bring myself to dock a star for that."
1,"I don't know if their food is good and frankly, I don't care. All I know is that I have NEVER in my life been so appalled at the horrible level of customer service at this location and I'll never go back. I called in my order one night and was told it would be 15 minutes. When I got there (20 minutes later) my order wasn't ready. I waited an extra 15 minutes before asking how long it would be. When the cashier turned around to find our how much longer, the ex-con looking a*hole of a fry cook in the back shouted some obscenities at me, called me a liar about how long I had been waiting, and that was pretty much all I needed to hear before demanding a refund and walking out the door. Long Wong's can suck a fatty; personally I wish that nasty eyesore had stayed closed."
5,"Easily the best TB in Madison (though with State St and University/Segoe closed, it's not much of a competition). Everything is made very well, very fresh, and very fast. Great service. The location rocks too right between 30 and Milwaukee. No complaints and this one is much less sketchy than the one on Park."
1,"OMG what happened to this place?  We hadn't been here in awhile, but the brisket was overcooked and soupy.  The links had no taste except were very spicy.  If the brisket at Dallas and Austin airports rate an 8, then this is a definite one or two.  They say your first instincts are best; we first went into the Philly sub place next door that had Coke products and walked out.  Instead we had overcooked, tasteless brisket and RC soda and spent $30 for two.  I was even going save some for the dogs, but I wouldnt have enough padding for the explosion that would cause.   Thank God I have a good cigar to get the taste out!!!"
5,"This salon IS the best of the best!!! Believe the hype! From the moment you walk in the door you are treated like royalty, This is not your average salon where you go for just a cut. I got a hand massage and a back massage. The owner Perry is there walking around talking to all the customers. The ladies are all friendly! Even if you don't live close by this salon it is well worth the drive."
1,"What are you in the mood for?  I truly suggest this place if you're looking for grade D salad and such AND if you want to leave in a clinically depressed state of mind.

Pros:  All you can eat

Cons:  Why in the world would you want more than a bite?????
Every different lettuce bowl contained gross amounts of browning greens.  While the spinach looked and tasted fresh, the romaine was not, the parmesan was the kind that resembles anthrax or cocaine, the dressing was uber-salty and quite disgusting, the bacon bits contained no trace of pig, and there was no protein other than cubed ham to be found.  

While I can see how the entire soup/salad/pasta/fruit/pizza/ice cream/tacos? package might be worth $7 and change, this was a horrible buy for a person looking for a salad with some ample protein.  When your name contains the word ""salad,"" don't you think you should offer some good greens?"
1,"Awful.  First impression:  bad.  Two of the front windows were broken, and at first glance all that was visible were the two thrift stores that bookend the ""restaurant"".  

The eating section looked quaint at first: clearly the original counter with lots of interesting items wreathed around it.  But upon closer look, the counter was in disrepair, trim had fallen off in places, and shelves were missing, requiring supplies and table settings to not only be displayed, but piled in a jumble on the surviving shelves in full view of customers.  Worse, the jukebox was broken which we only found out after we already wasted 2 bits.

Service:  terrible.  The wait staff was young and in need of training.   Our waiter didn't write down our order and had to ask 3 questions because he forgot.  Then two mistakes still were made with the order including an incorrect entree served.  There was a large table behind us our waiter also was serving and I overheard that a child's order was completely forgotten.  Dude, just write it down!  You're not ready for a big boy server gig, it's okay.

Food:  deplorable.   Other reviews correctly assess the embarrassing ""hamburgers"", but the fountain drinks (we had the root beer float and Breakfast at Tiffany's ) were weak sauce (literally).  I had the Ruben with potato salad which was decent, but I was pretty hungry and would have eaten anything.  I would have preferred fries but they weren't in the menu, no deep fryer either ?

Overall the ambience was that of a David lynch movie spliced with ""The Road"".  Clearly the brainchild of a spinster with dementia, this place may have seemed quaint in some rim town 20 years ago ,  but on Central Ave in PHX in 2014?  Bizarre.  Or rather bazaar, because you are eating a dubious meal surrounded by moth eaten clothes, rusty metal, and grubby rummage sale items.  The only thing missing are shouting fishmongers."
5,"I have never had a bad experience at this location. The hostess are always quick and ready to seat you with a smile on their faces. Waitresses are amazing as well! They are also quick and ready to serve, and all with great attitudes! This is by far, one of my favorite breakfast spots, not because of the food, because really, you can get pancakes anywhere, but it is the customer service that always brings us back. So IHOP team, thank you all so very much for always providing us with some of our best experiences, this team rocks! Thanks!"
5,The staff here were very courteous and knowledgeable! I felt like I could really trust them. The service was quick and completely worth it. I'll come here every time!
5,"Had to have my GTI towed here on a Sunday afternoon, Dave called me at 7:30 Monday morning to see what happened and I had a new water pump and timing belt in by 5pm. Honest, quick, fair prices, no annoying upsells. If you drive a VW, you should be taking it here."
5,"Fish. Eat it, enjoy it, thank me later"
5,"Grew up coming here and I love every time coming here. Someone complained that it wasn't that good because their meal which consisted of a side salad was not that ""great."" Are you kidding me? Who the heck grades a Mexican food place based on a side salad? Whatever. My enchiladas were great, the sauce was excellent and my rice and beans were of excellent moist and flavorful quality. I have always found the rice at Filiberto's to be dry but the rice here is very moist due to their being more tomato sauce in it and a compound called salt. 

Try the bakery, there are many excellent pastries to try and the salsa bar has more variety than you can find at the more common walk up Mexican eateries. As for all the comments on the parking lot being shady, honestly in the evening many families come in here to grab something to take home or to have a family meal. Seriously people, the parking lot was clean and well-lit, everything looked freshly painted and clear of trash. Come down off of your high horse and enjoy some good food."
5,"I have been a member of this gym on and off for the last several years.  My only complaint is that they only have one location.  No frills, no 'health club' feel and nobody bothering you about anything.  There is more than enough machines, racks, etc to be able to get a great workout in.  Waiting for equipment is rare.  Show up, get strong, leave, repeat."
5,Home of 2011 Phoenix Comicon!!!  I'll write more after it's over.  Can't wait! :)
1,"Came in on a Saturday evening to answer a pregnancy craving for the wife. Placed order at 5:41 and didn't get our order until after 7. The BBQ isn't that amazing especially compared to other places in the valley. While we were there three people elected to get refunds rather than wait for their order to be filled. When they asked for an explanation regarding the wait the guy up front shrugged his shoulders and apologized. 

Again it's not mind blowing food and will definitely look elsewhere for BBQ before coming here in the future."
5,"I can't think of anything bad to say about Vin Santo! The prices are the same as Olive Garden but the food is 10x the quality and 5x as authentic!  I have eaten at Vin Santo five times now and I am never disappointed, everything I have had is delicious, and the dessert (bread pudding, tiramisu) is to die for.  The owner is very sweet and accommodating and she is there everytime I go, it's a local family owned business with world class cuisine!"
5,"Great little vacuum store on the east side - they'll try to sell you a Riccar vacuum, which is kinda pricey, but believe me, they're right. Best vacuum I've ever used. Forget Dyson. Oh, and they'll demo the vacuums for you and explain everything. Really nice guys and worth checking out if you're in the market for a vacuum that's not a piece of junk."
1,"I was very nervous about going to my appoinment- I'm new to therapy. I had an evening appointment and the front office was closed when I got there, so I started filling out my new patient paperwork just as a sign had instructed. There was a bell to ring for service but no one came when I rang it (three times over 40 minutes). As people (I assume they were other therapists) came out of offices, no one acknowledged me or returned my smile. I finally got someone to take my paperwork and continued to wait. 

I got into my appointment about 15 minutes late. That happens and I don't fault anyone for that, but my appointment was also cut short. My therapist was disinterested in the entire shortened session. I was dressed pretty nicely but had exposed tattoos that seemed to bother her. She stared and seemed distracted, making me feel the need to explain to her that I was a good person more than once. Mind you, I was there for self esteem and anxiety issues, so feeling judged by an apathetic therapist was pretty unsettling. She didn't smile, she wasn't warm, and she wasn't encouraging.

After I left, I jokingly told someone that the therapy session helped in its own way because the woman I saw was so curt and unpleasant that it made me feel like a better person."
5,"Doug has been maintaining my two Rolex watches for over a decade.
He is honest, and technically superb.
A  pleasure to work with!"
5,"One of the best Mexican Restaurant's!
I've been to La Tolteca more than 5 times and everytime I've been there I've been satisfied. I love their tamales. I always get the red beef tamales. They are always warm and moist. Yum! I have tried the chicken tamales and they just aren't as good. They used to have a meat deli on the side by the register but when i visited a couple days ago it was gone and I'm not sure why. There salsa is great too! I love the guacamole and the extra hot salsa. The owner is so nice and you'll sometimes see her in the back preparing the food. One time when our order was ready, I brought the food to our table and my mother had ordered pork tacos by mistake and she meant to say beef tacos and they went ahead and exchange her order. 
I've read a couple of the comments on the breakfast and I wouldn't recommend it. My brother didn't really like eggs but I don't think breakfast is what they specialize in. Overall It's delicious and I will be coming back for more!"
5,"The black and blue quesadilla was amazing! And the chips and salsa are to die for! Service was great, too!"
5,"Very charming spot, reasonable prices and good food. We had a group with four children during a busy time and they accommodated us great. Nice to be able to eat with children in an adult restaurant
and not feel out of place.  We will definitely be back again."
5,"This is a very cool place for the kids and the family. My girls (6 and 8) absolutely loved being ""hands on"" with the exhibits. The storm simulator was my favorite - really cool to ""feel"" the different effects as the floor shakes and water is sprayed on your face.

Tip - as others have pointed out, the food in the cafe is a little on the high $$ side - but very good. If you are looking to save some coin. Your admission is good for in/out privileges all day - and being downtown is perfect for being able to take a short walk and explore other eateries.

Tip - If you are even thinking about coming back within a year (365 days), get an annual pass. They really make you feel special - they called me the day they mailed the passes to thank me for being a member and to let me know they were on the way. The admission you pay can be used to ""upgrade"" your pass to an annual if done on the same day."
5,"Great place to donate your gently used items to help out those that need it.

Everyone is always so friendly and grateful.  Maybe one day I can give more than just items."
5,"Gotta love this Market.  I take people here as a sort of a tourist attraction.  They have everything and it's all fresh.  A total culture shock, but fun none the less."
5,"Few things make me happier than wine and cheese -- so naturally, I enjoyed the Cheuvront! I wasn't in the mood to make any decisions myself (it was Friday, after all) so I let one of the owners surprise me with his favorite red wine and a cheese plate. The shiraz he picked was delish, and the cheese plate, especially the brie, was equally yummy. I'd suggest you go for happy hour, sit on one of the comfy couches, ask your server or an owner for their recommendations, and try a bunch of stuff!"
5,"Awesome! We went a little too early to see many butterflies at their exhibit, but it was still great and the grounds are beautiful!"
1,"Not a very good place at all.  Be very careful of this place as they tack on all kinds of move-out charges.  They make you show a receipt that the apartment has been ""professionally cleaned"" when move out.  I had my neighbor clean the place as she did an exceptional job.  Because she is not a registered cleaning company, they charged me $130 for not having a registered company clean the apartment.  Also, make sure that you pay rent before the first of the month if it falls on a holiday.  They charged me $75 for not paying them on time because they were closed on the first of the month.  Because they decided to close on the first, they charged other tenants and I $75 for supposedly paying late.  Be very careful if you decide to live at this apartment complex."
1,The food here is horrible for calling themselves an authetican mexican restaurant they are far from it. I am mexican and I can tell you their food is not at all good. Their tortillas are package their chips are package. The food has no taste. Not even my kids the usually eat everything like it. Their salsa sucks. I do not recommend this place horrible food. If you want good mexican food go to Pitic just around the corner or Carolinas.
1,.
5,Cheuvront's is a nice little spot in Downtown Phoenix and a perfect place for a date night. The wine and cheese was fantastic. I was also very impressed by the attentiveness of the wait staff. I'll definitely be going back!
1,"This place SUCKS.....joke is on you if you stay here. Only reason we did is because we hosted a customer seminar here the next morning. However, if you like staying in your great-great-great-great grandmothers old time shack you would enjoy it.

We arrived late (around 9 pm) and the valet guys were pretty good. I don't know if you can self park the car anywhere close. Valet asked my name and spoke into his headset, but after I walked the ten feet to the front desk the clerk had no clue who I was or what I was doing there (basically no clue at all). She couldn't tell me where our event would be (I like to check out the room the night before) or if anything had arrived for us (we shipped some things).

I headed up to the room and it reeked of fresh paint. I was going to call down, but decided I would stop on my way to the fitness center. The itself was AWFUL - could have really used a good cleaning and some new wall paper.....it just looked old and beat-up. Don't ever get suckered into staying in room 827.

Headed down to front desk and asked if the room was just painted, answer was ""I don't think so"", and instead of asking if they put me in a new room that was it. Service = Horrible.

The ""newly remodeled"" fitness center was weak -- very, very small, limited free weights, tread mills/ellipticals, and old weight machines. It would be a disaster if they had a house full of people who wanted to work out. Might be a nice spot if you were over 100 years old!

Headed back up to the room and was unimpressed with the shower and bathroom. I would say it was on par with a Super 8.

Although breakfast was included in our package, I headed down early to our event. I will say the food for that was great, service was top notch and the coffee cake was so unbelievably good...I also liked the free shoe shine.

No way would I ever stay at this location or any Ritz for that matter.

Total - $231.80 (room was 208 for the Schwab rate - including $18 breakfast)"
5,"Love All Pets!  

We drive all the way from McFarland to Middleton to go here because the staff, from the front desk to all the Doctors, truly care about the animals.  I've seen Vet Techs carrying sick animals around in slings to give them extra attention and care.  I've had them stay open waiting for me to arrive, they work you in for appointments as necessary.  

Seriously can't say enough great things about this clinic."
5,"La Tolteca is outstanding. Passing through PHX and a friend (and frequent visitor to AZ) told me I need to stop here. He spoke truth. 

Get the chilaquiles! Get them. 

We also had tacos de papa, and caldo de camarones...the latter was awesome too, delicious broth and packed with shrimp. The salsa bar had grilled jalapeños & habanero salsa we couldn't get enough of. 

I'll be back to La Tolteca. Five stars no hesitation."
1,"This place is old, furniture is ugly, rooms are dark and smelly. Add to that the manager was really rude... this was the worst part of the phoenix trip for me."
5,"Friendly neighborhood meat market. Everyday prices are competitive; weekly specials are spectacular--beats supermarket prices for much better quality meat. Best item: the Sheboygan brats. These are absolutely the best brats I've ever had, whether in Wisconsin or in Germany. Other varieties are very good, too.

The staff, moreover, is both friendly and knowledgeable. They can do practically any custom order. They get to know their customers and treat regulars like family."
5,I had a chicken burrito enchilada style with mole sauce. It was absolutely huge and delicious. I also got the rice and beans with it and the refried beans were literally the best I have ever had.
1,"Mr. Roberts is not a place I'd ever go to for the sole purpose of going out. Both times I've gone have been for bands, and both times were fairly different experiences.

My first time was a one-star experience: it was ridiculously hot and humid inside, the staff lacked any sort of motivation for good customer service, and they crammed the 7- or 8-piece band in the front of the bar near the window, making for awkward viewing and playing. The sound was terrible and I spent more time outside than in. 

My second time was a better experience, but still not one that would cause me to suggest other people go there. This time around it was a reasonable temperature in the bar, but that may only be due to the fact that it was in the 50s outside. The bands played in the back of the bar in an alcove/side room deal and it made a lot more sense. The sound was still deafening and subject to random strangers twiddling the knobs on the mixer, but overall not too bad. 

Free music is the best thing (only thing?) Mr. Roberts has going for it. Its biggest downsides:
- it's touted as a blue-collar bar, but it's more an excuse to be shabby and dirty than anything; $15 for a 5-bottle bucket of beer is not a good deal, and $5 for a PBR & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when it should be the standard price for such a combination
- the ladies room is ridiculously tiny and awkward, had a seat that was half hanging off the bowl, and no TP
- every surface was dirty or sticky, yuck

You probably won't die if you go to see a friend's band play, but supporting a friend should be the only motivation for setting foot inside."
5,"I'm going to flat out say this before I start writing the review, my aunt makes the best pupusas.  Now with that being said this is a nice little hole in the wall.  The place is nice and clean.  The food is cheap and delicious.  The people are really friendly and the old man behind the register always seems to great me with a smile ( I think he is the owner).  Mind you pupusas are more filling then they look so don't over order.  I like the traditional queso con loroco.  The plantains are also delicious."
5,I don't know what everyone else on here is talking about; this Whataburger is super fast!  The entire drive thru process took a grand total of four minutes.  Great place to stop for a quick lunch when you work downtown.
1,"I have a gift certificate for an Ultimate Makeover - 2 1/2 hours of consultation, cut, color, style and makeup.  I was really excited to try the Spa and in desperate need of a haircut so I called right away to make an appointment. I was lucky enough that the first available appointment, although 2 weeks away was on a Friday night.  I booked the appointment and made big plans to go out with friends to debut my new look (really, how often do you get to have your makeup professionally done for a night out.) Flash forward to an hour before my much anticipated appointment I received a voicemail message informing me that Mallory was running behind with another appointment and I would need to call to reschedule mine.  WTF? You're cancelling my appointment and not even apologizing or offering me any option like a shorter service?

I swallow my anger and return the call think that perhaps since they canceled my appointment, they would find a way to quickly accommodate me with a new appointment or perhaps upgrade me for the inconvenience.  Nope.  I was informed that Mallory's next time slot was a week and a half out or I could see someone else on a Tuesday - Who needs their makeup done for a Tuesday night?

Honestly if it wasn't a gift certificate I would just cancel and go somewhere else. This is NOT a great first impression.

To be fair, I would like to add that their phone staff have always been delightful. So that and the limitations of yelp are the only reason they get a star.  I will update after I have my service, hopefully they are worth the inconvenience and irritation."
1,"awful, food was not good, people with me got sick and will not go there again."
1,"I went here looking for items for my son's birthday - he loves vacuums, so we had a vacuum party for him. The salesman was very helpful and I ended up purchasing vacuum bags to use for the pinata. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the computer. It kept getting disconnected and so the salesman was unable to print me a receipt. I waited about 15 minutes for it to connect and then I had to leave. I asked if I could return the bags if I did not use them and he told me yes, as long as they weren't opened.

To make a long story short, I went back to return the unopened bags and was told I couldn't because I didn't have a receipt. I explained the situation to the manager at the store and customer service online and nobody seemed to give a $%&*. I can't believe Oreck lost a customer over $16."
1,"I walk on a Sat morning at 11am for a retouch on my ombre hair. I had it blonde already and the lady first told me to wait I did. She then came back got me started put foils on which I think she wasn't going to do bec my hair was already light. I show her a picture and ask her if thats how it was going to look a few times and she keep telling me yes. Long story short after3hrs or so she remove the foils and wash my hair put some treatment on it and left me there(for another 30-45mins). I got tired of waiting for her and wash my hair and I also blow dry my own hair bec she was busy with 2 other ladies. My hair was horrible YELLOW AND FRY so burn, uneven tones of yellow/orange/black and red when all I wanted was a caramel ombre. I was so mad but I still just pay her after 6+hrs all I wanted was to go home so I had no energy for arguing. I did told her I didn't like it and that it was too yellow she just said it looks pretty and continue on checking me out. I do not recomment Rachel or the location on 16th st at all. I when the next day with the intention of looking for the owner so I when to the other location on 15th ave and Camelback Lorraine was awesome she immediatley address me and apologize, did a color correction. She fix my hair it look exactly how I wanted. She was really nice/caring and ask what I wanted and not wanted. She was also super fast and did my hair in about 2hrs or less. I really recomment Lorraine at the Camelback location. She also didn't charge me for the correction she just apologize for the incovenience and gave me a treatment to fix my brittle dry hair."
1,"The Worst Haircut I Have Ever Grieved Over Was Here!

What is it about cheap or inexpensive?  Does that mean they are all rejects from the Hair Cut Academy or what?....I think I could have cut my hair better if I could have stood behind myself and had sheers.

I guess in this case, I got what I paid for...The haircut was a disaster, even when I explained to the woman to just cut a 1/4 inch off everywhere for shape, she cut the hair down to 1/4 inch from my scalp!!!!!$#@@!##@!#@  I was soooo P*SSED!  

But I learned a valuable lesson!----The difference between a good haircut and a bad haircut is about three to four weeks growth time!

There was one good thing though!---LEAVING!"
5,"Tracy gives the best massages - deep tissue.  She is hard to get an appointment with because she is so good.  But it is definitely worth the effort to get in.  If I could afford it, I would get a massage from Tracy every week!"
5,"I went to hooters, then came here. I don't care how big hooters is, Hard Rock Cafe is in a hole mother league! You guys rock!!! Sorry about the shitty tip."
1,"Not a fan of this place. I stopped by in the evening to grab a quick bite for a couple of buddies and the food was over all not very good. I called the order in and the food still was not ready after 30 minutes. The condiment area was disgusting. I know that it was at the end of the day and people get lazy at closing time BUT, it's still a restaurant!

Upon getting home, I was not surprising that the to go containers were poorly packaged  - it seems that mexican food, much like chinese food is suppose to explode in the bag when you take it home. The food is what you would expect from a chain mexican joint. The food wasn't very good. If you are in the area go to Taco Juarez, the food is comparably priced and feels authentic."
5,"I started going to Dunn's Import in 1981 when I owned my first car, a Datsun 210. Almost 30 years later, Jeff Dunn is still taking care of my car, along with my 3 children's cars too! Every experience is a great one at Dunn's. The staff are friendly and professional, and know their stuff!!
I would recommend Dunn's Import to anyone who has a foreign car. I trust him to service my own children's cars.I think that says it all!"
5,"I forgot to post this last month......
Best this place has been in years! Shrimp salad, chicken marsala, lasagna... all awesome! Service was the best its been in a long time too. I think our waitress was pregnant, I forgot to ask her name, but she was great!"
1,"Very poor customer service. Have been there 3 times in last few months and the same woman who I think is manager. she said some guy named John is owner. She is always rude never says hi, never has smile on, and just looks at you when you come in with blank stare. I came in to return package that needed very small amount of tape and I asked her if I could use some tape and she said it would cost me extra $1.10 for small amount of tape for top of box. She said strict orders from owner. Wow so you would rather lose a customer instead of giving them small amount if tape to help them out. I now go out of my way to go to another ups store."
1,"Bad business, bad service.  The only thing keeping this place in business is their awesome volleyball set up.  Place is trashy... so is the guy whose family owns the place.  If he isn't trashed and offending customers, and employees, then he probably isn't working."
5,"Fabulous show of Legally Blonde presented by Valley Youth Theatre!  There were even dog actors.  Loved it, loved the spirit of the young actors.  But more importantly, LOVED the brownies served hot.  Yum-o!  Got the recipe to share?"
1,"I don't understand what all the hoopla is about. The food was lousy. The ribs tasted like the cow had mad cow disease. The sauce was weak. Overall, the food is overpriced. I've gone to this place twice and all I can say is I loved the beer!"
1,"I went to the Paisley Violin sometime last week. Walking in we were greeted by terrible music. I mean there are tons of great Jazz musicians in AZ and some how they have found the worst. The server was an older gentleman who was nice. We ordered the sampler app that they have to start 2 min later the server tells us that they are out of pita bread. For entrees I ordered the Lamb which comes on a pita but i opted to get it on a croissant which he suggested they had. 2 min later he says they are out of that to. My friend ordered the Lox 2 min later he says they are out of that as well. So she takes his suggestion in ordering a cuban sandwich which you wont belive 2 min later he comes out and says they dont have all the ingredients for that either. This happened about two more times until we ordered what had seemed to be the only 2 things on the menu. Its called an 86 board, servers write down what you don't have or in your case what u do have, which is less. The server must have been embarrassed I would have been. Once we got our food, it was mediocre at best, cold and not fresh looking. I will never go here again, which is disappointing such a great space and no potential when it comes to the food."
1,"Eek! Methinks not.... this clearly doesn't describe this place.  Eek! Foodpoisoning Ahead.  That would paint a picture like Bob Ross on this damn place.  1 out of the 8 beef mini chimichangas had chicken...  I think it was chicken, it's been awhile since I have tasted rancid meat... but it's a taste you don't forget.  The waitress didn't check on the food after we received it, manager ignored me at first and then asked me if he could get me something else.... didn't want me leaving ""hungry.""  Don't worry... hunger is that last thing on my mind.  I told a group coming in that is isn't too late to turn around... they will probably read this later, so... I told you so."
5,"I've stayed here a couple times now.  If I reviewed my first stay if probably would have been 2 or 3 stars. Lucky for them.  

Back to my most recent stay.  It was the best experience ever.  (Second to the Double Tree in Carmel, IN.)  I walked in the lobby around 1PM and was greeted by Bobbie.  He was handling the desk by himself and I explained that we would wait in the lobby until they had a room ready (since we were 2 hours early for check in).  

My husband was anxious to watch the Bears game so he found a spot in the cozy waiting area with a big screen TV.  Bobbie offered to check us in early and I asked about our accommation request to be near the elevator or an area that would require very little walking.  It appeared that he may have had a challenge with our request.

I explained the huge inconvenience with our last visit.  The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?  My husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  Needless to say, he didn't want me to request a ""closer"" room after that.  This is why I give them my request when I book the room.

Fortunately for all of us, the extra planning helped. An extra bonus was that Bobbie ask if I was Priority Club Rewards member.  Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.  Bobbie was really good about explaining the details of the membership and even let me know how I can get extra points online.

Did I say how great Bobbie was?  Well...he was everywhere!  He hand-delivered our new membership information to our room (with chocolate and a beverage). Whenever he saw me in the lobby, he always asked if there was anything I needed.  He also helped out with the breakfast buffet in the morning.  He literaly was everywhere!  It's not like he was leaning on the counter when I saw him.  No, he was very proactive in genuinely making his guests feel comfortable.  He's definitely a keeper.  

Whenever I'm in the Madison area, I will continue to book at this Staybridge because of my experience and the excellent service that Bobbie provided."
1,"Just don't eat here.  I didn't know that Heinz made salsa.  Just can't seem to find anything positive to say about this place.  This is a town with a plethora of Mexican Restaurants, so you would think that competition alone would have closed this place.  Just drive over to Sylvia's La Canasta.  Its close, and very good."
1,Ordered food for delivery at a local hotel after 8 hours on the road.  Gave all details of where we were staying and after an hour and 15 minutes got a call asking why we had not picked up our food.  Were told there was no indication on the order that it was delivery!  Terrible miscommunication at their end!  When food arrived it was cold and not one fork or napkin in the bag. Very frustrating for hungry weary travelers...be careful if you are ordering delivery from this place!
1,"Negative experience overall. The place made me feel uncomfortable. I brought my new pre-owned baby (a 2012 bright red VW) to get her first wash here, thinking it was the ultimate deluxe treatment. I was so wrong. I didn't count exactly, but from start to finish I think there were 6 people who drove my car, and they didn't drive it with care or regard, and their clothes seemed dirty. They were tapping the brakes too hard and making me uncomfortable just watching them drive it. 

When you drive up, it is entirely unclear where to go. As a first-timer, I had no clue. A lazy guy in a Danny's uniform pointed for us to get in one lane, and then pointed to another lane, which was confusing. Then he came to the window and tried to upsell us on getting our car detailed and buffed, saying it would ""return it to new"". Buddy, it's a new car - it was washed a month ago at the dealership. When my husband politely said no, he seemed mad. We chose the VIP wash for $20 and from there it was a waiting game until our car was in the front of the giant blob that they call a line. In my opinion, it took a long time. I took my shopping bag inside with me, thank goodness I did because apparently there's been a lot of robberies there. 

After a short time through the tunnel and a half-assed rubdown from about 5 different thug-looking guys, the car was ""done"". Yes, the bird poop was off the windshield, but the ultimate telltale sign was there was still a  Starbucks straw wrapper in the front console that they didn't even touch. The interior detailing promised in the ""VIP Wash"" was a joke.

I'm highly disappointed. My car seemed worse off than it did when it went in. Next time I will go to Los Olivos. Even a Clean Freak $3 wash would be far superior to the yuckiness we experienced here."
1,"Let me preface this by saying this used to be my favorite restaurant in PHX... This experience has changed that...  I made a reservation for 11 5 days before the dinner at 730 pm on a Sat..  after arriving promptly at 730 we were forced to wait 20 minutesonly to be sat at 2 separate booths...  Completetly defeating the purpose of a group dining experience..  Now the bad part...  For dinner I ordered off the special menu a wild boar bacon wrapped bone in beef tenderloin cooked rare..  I received a baconless well done hunk of meat...  I pointed this out to the waitress she took the meal hoping to have it prepared correctly..  a few minutes later the manager approached the table and informed me they were out of the bacon ( one would think they would know that before the meal was prepared and attempted to slide this past the diner). I was offered a replacement meal , but declined and decided to go with the soup.... This prompted the manager to inform me it was a spicy dish to which I accepted and said it was fine, he proceeded to inform me of the heat of the dish 2 more times both times I assured him this was fine leading him to question my order again at which time I was in disbelief and asked if there is some reason he doesn't want me to  have the dish..   this was enough to finally agree to let me place the order the soup came and was excellent and spicy.   I managed to persevere through the heat and eat the whole bowl ( I enjoy spicy food).  This ruined the whole experience for me ..  luckily everyone else's meals were enjoyable its just disappointing being treated like that at a place I thought so highly of and do everythingin my power to get people I care about to do it....  A sad day"
1,"After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong.

* Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.

* French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.

* Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.

Guess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food!"
1,poor service took them 3 weeks to fix one darn bumper. NEVER do business with them EVER again.
5,"We moved into our Monona neighborhood over a year ago and ever since that day, Ken's has been a mealtime/neighborhood staple.  It's so easy to pop in and grab something delicious to throw on the grill.  They also offer a decent assortment of deli salads, pickled veggies, pies, wine, and other need-to-haves so you don't have to waste time running to large grocery stores for last-minute items.  New to Ken's?  Try one of their delicious pinwheels, or my favorite--burgundy and black pepper steak."
5,"After a hard day working an event across the street at the Sheraton, I was pleasantly surprised to find Sam's Cafe.  We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the most amazing chips + salsa which many people have raved about on Yelp.  Towards the end of the meal, manager Nicole dropped by the table to ask how the meal was and we enjoyed talking with her. She was very knowledgable about the city and the restaurant which I was surprised to find has a sister cafe in my town (St. Louis). I thought the food was good but not amazing. But the chips, atmosphere, service and overall relaxing evening made this a 5-start experience.  I'll go back and try something different and I'm sure it will be even better."
1,"Okay, I didn't even GET THERE and they were trying to upsell me and get me to buy their shampoo and conditioner OVER THE PHONE while I""m trying to make an appt.  When I didn't understand the woman (she was so focused on selling me on paying an extra $40 so they can show me how to use a shampoo and conditioner they have , hey, if I don't know how to use shampoo and conditioner yet, i shouldn't be functioning in society), she got all snooty and nasty.  So, I don't know how they cut hair, but if I get someone selling me products BEFORE I even put a foot in the door, I'm not going.  I want to go somewhere I can relax, thank you."
5,"This place is like heaven to me. Yes, it's a little overwhelming. Yes, it's a little overpriced. But that spells the makings to a great grocery store to me! The selection is second to none...especially for us gluten free folk. Produce is phenomenal. And if you haven't tried them yet their marinated chicken breasts turn a normally boring meal into a flavor explosion. (Seriously, try them.) If there's something specific you're looking for, you're bound to find it here.

Only things I'd say they can improve upon:
1. The deli counter. I know it's supposed to be super good quality deli meats but every single time I've gotten some they are pretty dry. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong kind? (Suggestions anyone?)

2. The sushi area. I've never actually tried it but it always looks a little scary.

3. The prepared foods section. I tried getting a salad or something here once and the man working behind the counter had no idea what was in anything. Since I'm gluten intolerant this can be pretty important. 

But even with these negatives, I keep coming back and actually look forward to going grocery shopping!"
1,"I'm seriously shocked that there are not more neg reviews on here about this place because I hear people bitching all the time. 

First of all, do not expect to make a quick 'in-and-out' experience. You walk in and put your name on the List.. yes, list with a capital L. What is interesting is they ask you what your question/comment/concern is but when you finally get called five hours later, they ask you to explain your question/comment/concern all over again.

Let's just say you have a Blackberry Pearl 8130 and the roller ball does not work anymore. Hypothetically, of course. So the highly skilled guy behind the counter looks at it for 2 seconds and says ""Oh, looks like it needs to be replaced..."" I'm pretty sure I already said that. ""Unfortunately, we don't have any of these in stock..""

Wha? Come again? You don't have any more of one of your most popular phones in stock, in any of the 542 colors it comes in? Boy oh Boy.

""Here, you can call this number and request they send you out a new one."" Great, the same number that told me I had to go into the store to get it replaced.

Oh brother what a bummer."
5,"Only place I trust for hand wash! Reasonably priced for a prestigious wash! They also honor all coupons from Yelp for full service. I've always left here satisfied with the service my on vehicle and customer service received by staff. 

They go soon and beyond on customer service, as I sit here writing this review a service member walked through the door with an elderly customer on his arm helping her in and let me add carrying her purse in his other hand.

Los Olivos also has a shoe shining service available for all those that are stopping by during lunch from work."
1,Went for lunch and was very disappointed. Restaurant smells musty and the food was awful. Service was very good.
1,"As if dentist/oral surgeon visits weren't bad enough, this place is AWFUL. 

I had to go here to have the rest of my wisdom tooth extractions because they were heavily impacted and needed surgery, which my regular (and awesome) dentist, Dr. Steen, could not perform.

First, imagine what you'd like a surgical center's office staff to be like. Sure, clinical, because they do the same thing every day. But how about professional? Professional would be nice. It was awful from the get-go. The front office lady looked very un-washed and her makeup looked a few days old. No ""Hello"" ""How are you"" or ""How may I assist you"", she just looked at us when we walked in and waited for us to say something. Then, ""Sign in"". 

There were some problems with payment and she not only was unbudging, she was straight up snooty about it. She actually asked if I wanted to remove the anesthesia to bring the cost down.

UM, I'M GETTING ORAL SURGERY HERE, LADY. SOME DOCTOR IS GOING TO BE DRILLING INTO MY FACE AND SPATTERING BLOOD EVERYWHERE. I THINK I'LL KEEP THE ANESTHESIA. 

Do I look like the guy from A Million Little Pieces?

The doctor himself was very arrogant and Tom Cruise-esque in Cocktail, rolled up sleeves and all. He had the audacity to call my other doctor (Dr. Steen, great guy, very gentle) names because my recovery time was longer. ""Yeah, I'm really good at this, so it'll take ten minutes, tops. And you'll barely have any residual pain."" Look where I am now, Dr. Day! At the same pain levels as when I was with Dr. Steen. Ass. 

Dr. Day's little nurse techs strapped me down in the chair and started talking about another tech rather disparagingly, as if I wasn't there. Helloooo, I'm about 6 inches from your face and am not yet sedated. Could you hold off on the shop talk until I'm off in dreamy dream land? Kthx.

I would suggest you ask for a different referral if your dentist's office tries to send you here. Dr. Day and his staff are competent at best, but so rude and unprofessional, I'd rather go to Mexico than have anything else here."
1,"The place sucks.  I don't care if a commie or socialist or nazi eats there.

The owners are what concerns me most.

I enjoyed the food the first time but when I ready they had the ass't governor holding some fricking prayer service there I was through.

I don't care what any businesses politics are BUTT I don't want to hear or read about them."
1,"So me and my buddy (coworker who is hourly) decide to go to lunch today.  What's the catch?  We don't know where to go.  We decided to go somewhere we haven't tried before that was off the beaten path. Enter Harvey's. Er, well, actually we did the entering.

We get into the place and it is a narrow bar with a line of tables to the right. We sit. We wait.  Finally, after much gab, the Waitress/Bartender comes up to our tables and says 'Hi' then proceeds to stare at us.  Anticipating the usual question 'Can I start you guys off with something to drink'  I order an RC cola and my buddy does the same.  She recommends the Cheeseburger so thats what we get.  I also ordered a mixed basket because (FOR SOME STRANGE REASON) fries aren't included with the burger! THIS IS AMERICA PEOPLE!!!!!

Along with the burger and fries, we got a lot of time to chat.  and I mean a LOT.  They sure are generous with time!!! Eventually, I ask her to put it in To Go containers and they give us the fries and cokes free.

Also, just a side note.  Please eat your food before coming on to Yelp and reading reviews about the food you are eating.  Some of these reviews almost made me vomit... almost."
5,"I just have to add my bit, we love this store and do all our food shopping here do to the high quality food and the great staff especially Marvin! Thanks for doing a great job!"
5,"Anyone bashing the E as the home of the Tea Party is seriously misguided.  This place is so eclectic you might find some card carrying communists at the bar from time-to- time.  Seriously, the large crowd of regulars and semi-regulars ranges from former and current Dems to the same on the Republican end.  Non-partisans, liberals, libertarians, agnostics, Catholics, retirees, got em' all at the Esquire.  John Sr. is a conservative but he welcomes everyone with genuine good cheer and gratitude for coming to his place.  More than 50 years in the Kavanaugh family - this place was LOCAL before local was trendy.  Shame on you purveyors of misinformation - no better than Scotty Koch, himself.

Excellent drinks at the bar from Joe, Nick and Ben (and Nate on Fridays).  Great pours of many wines by the glass.  Terrific fish fry and food.

btw - Saturday after the big 70k rally, many of us were warming up at the bar, having a drink or wine and some food and swapping ""war stories"" and photos from our day on the square protesting against the nit wit that was elected governor.  Tea Party my rear end."
5,"5-stars for Papa John's? Am I crazy?

Yes. Probably.

But it really is worth of the rating. Why?

- So easy to order online; brilliantly intuitive and logical
- The inside of the store is spotless - I've never seen it in disarray
- Staff is friendly and efficient
- Consistent quality; there's no hoping the pizza is as good as a previous time - it just is
- Never greasy
- Quite possibly the best ""well done thin crust"" pizza I've ever had in the Madison area. It holds-up without flopping over, even when piping hot, and it's always perfectly cooked, without being burned or overly charred. 

I'm not a fan of their commercials or PJ's personal philosophies. That said, I have yet to find a better thin crust in Madison. I'll keep looking, though."
1,They messed up our reservation didn't get to eat...had to leave to get to Comerica after 30 minute wait...
1,"The Wrigley Mansion is one of a few historical venues in a city that does not value its past and history. That said, you would think that fact would guarantee a top quality meal and fine dining experience at Geordie's Restaurant. Regrettably, Geordie's turned out to be no better than any other overly-hyped but underwhelming restaurant one would find at a 4- or 5-star resort.

I have lived in the Valley for nearly 10 years, and last night was the first time I had ever visited the Wrigley Mansion. I always felt somewhat guilty for never have visited, but I can say with near 100% certainty that my first visit is also my last. The service and wait staff performed well, but the food was the equivalent of one might get at Applebee's, and certainly not worth what I paid.

I started off with the carpaccio, which was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. I have had some mediocre carpaccio before, but never this poorly prepared. I suspect a bad cut of beef. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries that arrived with excessive garlic. The fries themselves were overcooked and tasted like Jack In The Box fries. Generous amounts of catsup were required to make them somewhat edible. For the entrée I tried the server-recommended lamb chop, which I requested to be prepared medium. When it arrived, it was clearly not medium. The meat was tough and lacked any flavor, and the au jus was entirely too salty.

The beverage service was quite prompt, however I think the bartender should go back to mixology school. The Manhattan I ordered had too much vermouth and hardly any bitters, while the lemon drop was neither sweet or bitter.

The purpose of the evening was to celebrate a friends birthday, so our dinner party had a whole room to ourselves. Given the size of the party, the wait staff did do an excellent job of making sure we were well served. Our glasses were never empty and the food did arrive promptly. Unfortunately, that alone could not make up for the poor food quality and exorbitant price."
1,"I have been here twice now and each time was disappointing, the outside of the building gives this rustic homemade italian food appearance and I wound up eating lukewarm microwave quality tv dinner style dog food. the service was worse than the food. Honestly we were told we would have a table in five minutes and were allowed to wait at the bar. fifteen minutes later we finally received attention enough to place a nonchalant drink order, which didn't come to fruition for another five minutes. my girlfriend and i were ghosts. never coming back."
1,"Food is eh. Service is TERRIBLE! They are rude and don't care about customers. Asked if they had more carrots because they were out in the front the lady went in the back and came out 15 minutes later because another employee told her I was there. I asked again about the carrots and she just said ""we don't have any"" she didn't even look!! Thanks for telling me and wasting my time! The armados a few blocks down is so much better!! I don't know how this place stays open for business."
1,"Got kicked out of Fridays First Row! What a bunch of pieces of craps! We only had 2 rounds of drinks there, we weren't being loud or obnoxious, the place was practically empty and the manager couldn't give us a satisfactory answer as to why we were being dismissed. The only thing he kept repeating was ""I have to back his bartenders."" WTF?! It's cool to have a manager to back you up like this but c'mon guy! YOU didn't even notice anything out of the ordinary from our group, you were right there!!! WE WERE NOT DRUNK OR LOUD! 

Even thought that was our last drink there, it still pissed us off. Needless to say, they didn't deserve a tip and we took our business to a place that appreciates having a good group of day drinkers at their empty establishments on a slow Saturday afternoon. In downtown Phoenix, it wasn't hard to find the next spot...

*** Da Bafroom: Sorry folks, we were not there long enough to make this visit.  But I'm sure it stinks just as bad as the serivce we got though!"
5,"My boyfriend and I headed out to Louisianne's on the recommendation of a couple of his friends. We were encouraged to make reservations as the couple noted how this place is frequently filled to capacity every night. 

Well, Sunday night it's not so. And that's when we went.

Louisianne's is located underground, and the atmosphere below is warm and inviting. To the left is the bar with the piano and stage for the jazz bands that play nearly every night. In front of and to the right are small, white-clothed tables. 

Our service was excellent. Because there happened to be so few people there that night, the host and the waitress were both quite talkative and welcoming. The meal was delicious (you don't need appetizers here - the entree portions are QUITE large). 

I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back for the nights of live jazz."
5,"O My Gosh! Me and my husband alwasy come here, and we love it! Everytime we go, it's always so packed we can barely move in and out of the crowds of people... but thats what makes it fun... They have three different dance rooms with different styles of music in each one. Me and my guy love the salsa/bachata room. They also have a nice poutdoor patio type thingy... when the weathers nice its ah - mazing! I never pay for our drinks so I couldnt tell you how that goes, but as far as the having fun part its def up to par!  We always run into friends and another plus is theyre open till 4am!!!! Obviously last call is at 2am.... but we dance off all our alchohal and still leave with a nice buzz.... I guess you would have to be into latin style music, but Im telling u... u wont be disappointed if your adventurous."
5,"I attended our high school graduation (I'm an English teacher) at the nearby US Airways Center. We walked over to Coach & Willies afterwards to be treated to a meal and two drinks by our school owner and principal. 

Service was fast...no complaints. My whiskey blackened steak wrap was yummy. The two free beers (paid for by the school principal/owner), even better."
5,"First off, this is a USED bookstore, yet a large majority of their books are in almost new shape. Great selection. The last 4-5 times I went to Barns n Nobel at east town and found a book I wanted, I decided to check to see if they had it at half price books, and THEY DID! ALMOST EVERY TIME!!! And for half price, or less!! The staff is very helpful, and you can call ahead and see if they have the book you are looking for. If they do, they will gladly put it on hold for you at the front desk for up to a week at NO CHARGE! Staff is very friendly, and store is always neat and clean. Definately a winner. Always call and check here before paying full price for any book!!! They also buy/sell used records, cd's, movies, and computer software and games."
5,Class act here. We in today with our C421 (N21GF)  for college football game. Top of line service for all our needs. Rent car brought out plane-side for our use. Line service very attentive to all our requests and anticipations. Nice lobby for pax and crew needs. One of the better service stops we have been into...ever. Today was a test for all the staff here because of the heavy traffic coming in for ball game. They were on top of things for sure. Thanks folks. Really well done.
5,Wonderful space. I cannot believe it is free. It is truly a gem of Madison. The history and story behind the Thai Pavilion is remarkable and it's a can't miss. Just keep your grubby little paws off of it if you want it to stick around...
5,"When I was a kid I used to love to go to the Hardware store to go looking at stuff and talk to the nice people that worked there.. WHen I visit this location of Ace I feel I go back in time. 
They are super nice, super helpful but do not smoother you... They know how to make keys that work ( hard to find these days I have learned). I feel comfortable asking questions here as well. They never treat me like ""Oh you are a girl"". I think their prices are not too bad and you get much better quality like screw that will not strip etc.. 
 Parking is awesome here for people who are handicapped or have  a bad back you can park like right near the door practically.."
5,"I use to boat in this area alot.  I always made this place to stop for  breakfast. very good.   They are know for there Walleys and eggs,  Some people even like a bloody mary or vodka and orange served with them.  Anything on the menu is good.  Nice place on the water.  You can come by boat or car.  If you come by boat a nice little ride over to Madison area makes it a fun day."
1,"This is the worst fast food franchise in town.

The drive through is slow.  The food is inconsistent.  The staff are ambivalent.

Averaging over a minute per vehicle in the drive through isn't ""fast"".  Serving burgers with mere samples of the veggies in the marketing material demonstrates poor attention to detail, if not inventory management problems.  

They can't even consistently pack bags so that the fries stay in their containers.  Why bother with the containers at all if the fries are just going to be scattered throughout the bag?

The franchises in Sun Prairie and De Forest remain ""east side"" options, but I'm giving up on this location.  Four chances in two years, and they never got it right."
5,Loved it!  Reasonably priced.  Lots of food!  And I like the atmosphere/setting.
5,The general tso's and boneless spare ribs are about as good as you'll find. No lie!
5,"This place is phenomenal. Hands down.

My trainer recommended this place to me for some inexpensive pet supplies and handed me a catalog. She warned me that this is a warehouse, so don't go here expecting a pet resort type store.

When you walk in, they take your purse and put it in a locker and then give you a card to retrieve it when you're leaving. It was my first experience there, so I wasn't sure where to go, but all of the employees were really friendly and eager to help!

Walking through this place is dangerous. I came in to buy a play pen and a hammock for my car, but left with a basket full of toys and treats! The prices are unbeatable. 

I found out from an employee there that you can call in your order from the catalog. The catalogs are free, so you call the store, give them your order, and it's ready for pick up in about 2 hours! This is a huge plus since items are sometimes hard to find. 

I highly recommend this place for all of your pet supplies!"
1,"DON'T SUPPORT THIS VENUE unless you find hot-tempered, violent behavior from management towards hired artists acceptable.

Friday March 30th I went to see some of my favorite bands perform at this venue. One of them being the well-loved Phoenix band Snake! Snake! Snakes! Drummer David Cooper was physically assaulted by the venue manager Caesar Rodriguez* when he walked into the managers office and asked to borrow a rug that he needed to put under his drum kit. Rodriguez told him no, and said he didn't give a f$#k. Cooper then asked why they had bands play here if they didn't give a f$#k. To which the venue manager responded by dragging Cooper out of his office by his collar, put him in a choke hold, and drug him down the stairs in front of at least 100 witnesses. If you haven't seen Snake! Snake! Snakes!  -- this is a very kind, peaceful, fun indie band, and great people as well. Professionally they are always a pleasure to work with, and they don't even remotely appear menacing. To make this story even more odd - David was having a professional conversation with this same manager just an hour before the altercation. I saw David being drug down the steps, and then I hung out with him for the next couple of hours while waiting for the Phoenix Police.

PS - the sound system was absolutely atrocious, when I told the sound guy there was a problem with the bass amp cutting in and out, it he told me that it was the bands equipment, and it clearly wasn't. The problems started with the first band, and continued through the second band. All of the amps were cutting in and out, there cracks, pops and echos, it appeared to be some sort of electrical current problem.

*The source of this name came from the head of security at the venue"
5,"This hotel is fantastic! The staff is amazing, friendly and super helpful. The rooms look newly renovated and very clean. The breakfast is yummy and the location good. That's the place to stay when you are in Phoenix."
1,"I wish I could give this place no stars.  The place was nasty, food had no flavor, desserts were freezer burnt, and the only thing good was the McDonald's we had after we left this place disappointed!"
5,"This place is a Phoenix institution and has been in operation for 33 years! The dishes are inexpensive, great sized portions and full of flavour.

For around $5 you can get a big bowl of rice and teriyaki chicken, for a dollar more, beef or fish. The panko chicken is excellent and comes with a choice of three sauces. My girlfriend's favourite is the vegetable bowl, which comes in under $5! She loves it. Appetizers are also inexpensive - 4 gyoza with pork or shrimp for under $1.79 and 3 spring rolls for $1.39. The sushi is a bit boring, although again, very inexpensive.

The service is amazing - personable, engaging and friendly. Decor is a bit dated, but that doesn't bother me. I'd rather the prices stay low than pay a premium for fancy booths and a mural of Mount Fuji.

I only wish they stayed open a little later than 6:30...."
5,I've been here a few times over the years.  Nice intimate theatre with really well done performances.  I was at Gypsy this Sunday and loved it.
1,"I can't review the food here because we never got seated! Knowing that Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations, my sister called Saturday afternoon to find out how long it would take a party of 14 to be seated that night. The hostess told her she'd take the name, asked my sister to call 20 minutes ahead to let her know we were on our way and our table would be ready shortly after we arrived, if not when we got there. Sounds perfect right? Not so much. 

We called them as requested and were told our table would be ready when we arrived. When we arrived about 15 minutes later, we were told they were running approximately 20 minutes behind. Not a huge deal, being Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night. After 30 minutes, we asked again about being seated and were told that they were waiting for their large table to be vacated by a party who'd been there for 2 hours. Of course... who doesn't go to Cheesecake Factory for dinner at 4:00? Another twenty minutes goes by and again, we speak to the hostess station, who tells us the table just ordered dessert. At this point, it becomes pretty apparent we've been lied to. Finally after waiting for more than an hour and 15 minutes for a supposed reservation with two pregnant women, a diabetic and two antsy toddlers, we decided to leave. 

I have no problem with Cheesecake Factory not taking reservations. I think it's ridiculous, but it's publicized, so we dealt with it the best way we could. Had the hostess we'd spoken to earlier in the day not said it wouldn't be a problem, we would have made other arrangements for dinner that night."
5,"Welcome to my backyard.  

Oh wait, I'm hallucinating again.

But seriously, this place is wonderful.  I love going here, and I do wish my backyard looked like this.

Unfortunately for me, I brought a minor with me.  Minor claims to love nature and wants to see it up close and personal, but at the same time is deathly afraid of bees and butterflies.  Most people can understand being fearful of bees and their stings, but butterflies?  

It's the kind of irrational fear I can only compare to being terribly frightened by a marshmallow.

If you were there today, you probably saw the minor racing through the gardens like they were on fire, screaming and crying and begging for mercy from the winged feigns of fiery death and destruction, otherwise known as butterflies.  

I thought I could convince minor to hold my hand and ""trust"" that I wouldn't let anything bad happen, but apparently I'm a lousy saleswoman and/or my evil plot to feed innocent children to flying insects was all too apparent.  Dang!!!

Minor covered the grounds in record time and was back at the lobby begging to leave.  A wave of relief washed over minor's face when we were safely back in the confines of the car, far far away from the flying death stingers and soul crushing, face smashing butterflies of satan.

But other than that, this is a lovely place when we are not there.  

Thank you and goodnight."
5,"Galee gai is the cure-all for allergies, the flu or a hangover. Trust me, I know hangovers.
The waitresses are all amazing and beautiful and nice.
Friday and Saturday nights usually yield an awkward wait (who was really here first?).
I have never had a bad meal or experience here."
1,"Went with husband and a friend.  

We ordered food.   I ordered the blackened mahi.   I had it elsewhere in multiple states from Hooters.   

Husband ordered the big fish sandwich blackened and friend ordered wings.

His was not breaded

The food came out and the fish on appearance looked fried.   The lady stated that it was breaded and grilled.

I have never heard of such and as stated I ate at quite a few locations.

Soon the manager (I assume) came over and stated that she can show me where it states breaded.

It doesn't state it on the menu which is common if something is breaded.

Also she said that it was a new item at that location for about 6 months.

I ended up sending it back, because it was not what I anticipated and didn't want breaded and battered food.

Also since then I have been to a couple other Hooters in Phoenix and Tempe and they did not bread or batter the ""blackened"" mahi.

I will never go back here.    Didn't like the service or lack there of or the food."
1,"Horrible food, my third visit and extremely over-priced. I was there this week for a medical group and the waiter suggested the bone in Kona Crusted dry aged sirloin which was so tough I could not chew it and each bight was gristle and fat. I had to discretely put each bight in my napkin before I gave up on the meat. I wanted the filet but he told me the sirloin was better (e gads). Honestly I wouldn't even take it home to my dog. I considered doing this with the bone but felt that the gristle and fat would do her harm.

The manager tried to make good and apologized and gave me two coupons for $25 off (which wouldn't cover the tip on the next visit). It would have been nice for a waiter to make eye contact with us so I could have flagged him over to order a hamburger. Because I of this I went without dinner this evening - actually I ate a hog dog at 9:30 PM and that was dinner.

Do your self a favor and book your next reservation at Morton's 480-951-4440 or Ruth's Chris (602) 957-9600 which is across the street if you want a good steak."
1,"I used to frequent this restaurant until what happened to me on April 3rd.  I invited some guests to dine with us, the meal was as always excellent, and service was decent.  All was fine until I got a call 90 minutes after leaving the restaurant from my credit card company at 10pm asking me if I was at Frys Grocery and had just before been at Home Depot, seeing as I was at home I replied no.  I had left my credit card in the check presenter and somehow it made it's way to into someones hands that obviously was not me.  To say I was annoyed would be an understatement, that is until I called the owner the next day and explained the gravity of the situation, she had the nerve to tell me that it was basically my fault and that her staff would never do anything like that and that she would do nothing about it, not even an apology!! In the days of Social Media, not taking customers seriously is risky business, i have shared this story with 50 plus people and I am sure they have shared it with some more.  I have left my credit card at several restaurants over the years and have always been confident in the honesty of a business and next day retrieved it and not had someone go shopping in my absence.  Visit this restaurant at your own peril and if you have to pay cash!!"
1,"This place had a flood so they ran fans all night.  My sink had a dirty ring that was a different color than the rest of the counter around the entire sink.  My room was not very clean.  My view is of a power plant.  The white trash people around the pool kept cursing around children, and management refused to do anything about.  This place is a trash pit."
1,"Once again I went to this location with the same results...they totally screwed up my order, I got a grilled chicken stuffed burrito, this thing was literally all tortilla and nothing else folded and burned into what kind of resembled a burrito. Garbage seriously tastes better then anything at this location. I have lost all faith in Taco Bell. SERIOUSLY NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"
5,"Finally got back around to this place (right in my neighborhood!) after 2 1/2 years!  We just have so many excellent places to eat here in the Valley!

Arriving about 11 AM today, a Tuesday, this nice, fairly large place was already roaring busy!  I did get seated right away, but they were soon full, with quite a crowd in the waiting room by the time I left.

For this visit I decided on one of the four white board Lunch Specials of the Day (in addition to the Tuesday Lunch Special contained in the printed restaurant menu).  This was a Pablano Chile Relleno and Pechuga Asada (broiled, boneless chicken breast).

My friendly server gal showed up right away with good toasted tortilla chips and a cup of their spicy hot, pureed red salsa.  Next came a small bowl of their Soup of the Day, which was Conchigliette y Carne Deshebrada in a tomato based sauce.  Yum!  (Having soup included witl lunch at no extra charge is one of things that make this place special!) 

At the right time, my big platter of the main courses arrived.  Everything was beautifully placed, & the chile came stuffed with Queso Oaxaca, breaded, deepfried, and treated to some delicious toppings.  Along side was the tasty, good-sized chicken steak plus generous servings of creamy tasting, cheese coated refried beans & fluffy Spanish Rice.

Every bite of this meal was absolutely delicious, and again I wish I had brought my camera along to show it off, but suffice it to say that I'm so glad I came to this great restaurant today!     :-))

Relleno Pablano y Pechuga Asada Lunch Special:  $9.25"
5,"This is a shout-out to Matt & Ashley at this location.  They are awesome!!  On a super cold day when it was already dark & snowing, Matt completed my rental agreement, put on his coat, went outside to get my car & then drove it around so that I just had to hop in.   Ashley is also super nice & helpful, and was able to assist me with a larger car when I needed one.  I hope corporate is reading these reviews, because the Madison location of Enterprise is doing it correctly!  Thanks Matt & Ashley!"
5,"Yes its Starbucks and I prefer Ancora, but.this Monona location has the best service, friendliest staff you will find. It's often busy at 9 am but it's fast as one could expect. I've been to the others and it's no contest, Monona rules. No drive through, but I find the staff so good I don't mind coming in.Very well run."
1,"I haven't yelped in about 2 months, and I was waiting for a place to either wow me or disgust me.  Well, this place was that bad. 

First impressions were all right -- the outside bar was neat w/ good views of downtown, and the fire pits were nice.  No beers on tap though; and seriously, what's with the hip-hop club DJ at 7:00 pm?  Come on guys, way too early for that.

It wasn't too long before three of us were seated; and after about 10 minutes, our waitress came up and asked us whether we were ready to ... oh wait, that's right, no menus yet, good job.  O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles.  Seriously?!  Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in.  Yuck.  And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice.  I'm sorry, isn't it supposed to be the other way around?  My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless).

So yeah, I don't recommend this place.  Instead, head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food."
1,In need of updating.  Very 1983.
5,"I love this place! Good for all ages and relatively cheap, a win-win!!
If you park in the heritage parking lot they win discount your parking ticket to only $3 bucks and its usually $12! another win!

We went and checked out bodyworlds and the brain, and if you have never been here, YOU have to go and check it out. Even if you have gone and you know someone who might enjoy it, i think it is the type of place you can go again and see/learn things that you missed your first time through. 

We ended up on level two playing in the kids area( don't be fooled they have pretty cool stuff in there). plus, its o.k to let your inner kid out sometimes. :)

A definite must see, and i won't be surprised if i end up back here again.
Very cool!"
5,"This venue is definitely SMALL which I personally love since every seat is better.  I came here last night for the Arena Football League championship game between the AZ Rattlers and the Utah Blaze for a place in the Arena Bowl.  Maybe it was the fact that the family friendly dedicated fans are amazing, or the fact that it's arena football (which I've never been to), but I felt that this venue is expertly managed.  The music at the game was great, they kept the energy going all night long, and the decor of the arena speaks to the neighborhood friendly arena.  It may not be as big and sparkly as several other venues, but it's one that's right up my alley.  Plus, traffic coming out is worlds better than Staples Center in LA or Oracle Arena in Oakland.  I can't wait until I can come back here for a concert!"
1,"Another dismal review for this company. I called for a 6 AM pickup to the airport like I had several times previously. Dispatch informed someone would arrive. I waited until 6:10 AM and called again-dispatch then told me another 15 minutes until pickup! I stated that was not acceptable as I had a flight to catch. I ended up driving myself to the airport. Oh yeah, the driver called, as boarding for my plane started."
5,"My wife's 98 durango took a dump, if you know whats I mean.i'm new to the area and peoples here said this place was fair.they couldn't have been any truer.this is a great place and great service.hopefully don't have to come back soon , but if I did I would come here."
5,"The real deal!  If you like your Catholicism quiet and personal with a little organ music and perhaps some donuts after mass, then St. Mary's downtown Phoenix is the parish for you.
Originally built in 1881, it is the oldest Catholic Church in Phoenix.  Staffed by the Franciscans and located in the heart of Downtown Phoenix.  The masses are traditional, thoughtful and beautiful.  The choir is phenomenal and there is an innate sense of family there-even as a guest."
1,"Well, we went back for a 2nd time, & this will be the last time we go to Scott's Deli.... It was over 100 degrees today and the AC was not working...It was VERY warm in the restaurant which made our dining experience pretty miserable.  They had all of their ceiling fans on at full blast in the backroom which dried up my contact lenses & our napkins would keep flying off the table. We got the Greek Omellete and the cucumbers in it were bitter...had to take them all out. The waiter never even said 'I'm sorry""......
 I am from LA and there are faaar better Deli's there than here in Phoenix! 
This deli was pretty average, nothing like Jerry's Deli, or Canter's Deli in LA....NOW we're talkin'!  
On a side note, I am so sick & tired of ALWAYS seeing sports on TV's in restaurants! ...Okay for sports bars, or maybe Applebee's, but it is like everywhere you go! It would be refreshing to actually see a movie playing on a TV at a restaurant....Something that the whole family can enjoy watching, just saying. :)"
1,"Worst customer service EVER.  This is a repeat offense with the car audio install bay.  

The rep Anthony has a really offensive sales tactic of treating customers like idiots.  He must have some kind of super power because he told me (over the phone) that what I had in my car currently sounded ""okay"" but not as good as it could if I bought some new speakers in addition to the deck I was inquiring about having installed.  

You know what Anthony, I'll go to Fry's or better yet order from Crutchfield."
1,"Disgusting. 
That's the only word that comes to mind after walking front of store to back and seeing piles upon piles of clothing and items askew on every table, shelf and rack. I'd understand if it was 7pm on a Saturday (weekend) but this was Monday morning y'all, and the place looked like the pits! What the heck BR? You are a mess! An absolute mess. And you're consistently a mess. 
I walked in today with the intent to buy a suit (40% your entire purchase... sign up for their emails) but I couldn't even shop the racks with crammed half on hangers, half off hangars pants and jackets. This place needs an iron fist. A store manager who can shape this thing up and restore BRs name as a Gap Inc brand. Someone would have to tell me they did a complete 180 for me to return."
1,"Visiting from out of state to see a friend in White Christmas and I took a photo of the final bow of the performers - without a flash - in order to share it with the cast, and I was pulled aside by an employee and forced to delete the photo as they watched me to ensure it was deleted.

I specialize in copy right and entertainment law in Los Angeles, and found this to be stunningly petty.

You can decide if that's an environment you'd like to go to for your entertainment."
1,"All this hype for nothing.  

1.  This place has no natural foods.  I wasnt expecting whole foods, but really, whats the point?  
2.  They have very little gourmet food.  
3.  Why not just go to Fry's or Safeway?  I mean seriously... ""fine foods""?? You sell friggin cherios. Whats fine about that?  

The same exact stuff you get at safeway for more $.  I will shop at Sprouts.  Hey AJ... GFYS."
5,"When traveling in downtown Phoenix, there is always a lot to choose from during the day for food stops.
One of the places that has been here for as long as I can remember, yes seriously that long! Is The Blue Fin.
I remeber thinking 30 years ago ,I wonder how long this place will be here.
 Yet here it stands in 2013 still going strong. Which makes me really happy.

I love when local business can do great!  They have always been great ,very friendly service and fresh food. The panko breaded items are light and feel healthy. All the vegetables I get here are  always crisp and fresh.
I guess it is because, they take pride in the place. Something you do not always see. I believe that they have lunch specials every week day.
However , they do charge extra for the little things. Like making it extra spicy is like .35 extra and brown rice is a little extra, I mean barley enough to where you would even notice.

They have soup, and sushi, salad,etc.
Lots of nice cool drinks. If the weather is cooler(below 90) you can sit outside and enjoy the light rail going by.
Which also means that you can take the light rail here as well.
It is located in the same spot as always, right next to the Phoenix, Public Library.
When in downtown Phoenix, give it a try."
1,"Very disappointed. I have been using Honey Bears BBQ for several years and always had a reasonable experience up until about a year ago. I used them a lot for catering orders (30+ people) and also used them on regular office orders (10+ people). They recently started cutting their portion sizes way back so much so that I would have to order for 20 when I needed it for 10. The huge disappointment was when I ordered Honey Bears for a retirement party in the office (I made the order a week in advance). The day before they were supposed to deliver I called to confirm the order, the woman on the phone stated that they wouldn't make the delivery time that was quoted on the invoice - not acceptable when you have an office full of people waiting on their lunch. So I offered to pick it up, when I arrived at the Van Buren location, I had to wait 30 minutes for the order which was still way beyond the quoted time. I was also told at the cash register that they ""were out of peach cobbler that day"" so none of my guests received dessert - which may have not been a big deal except for the fact that it was a retirement party. The people assisting at the front counter and the helpers were all rude and unfriendly and did not care that the order was late or that they didn't have the complete order prepared...they have been around a long time but their customer service is AWFUL as in - they don't have any."
5,"My business partner and I stayed at the Speckled Hen by chance while on business in Madison.  All hotels were booked and we were lucky enough to get a room here.  I can't say enough about this B&B.  We were overly impressed with the Inn, the Inn Keepers, our rooms and the breakfasts OMG!!! Awesome ;)   I felt at home here, my room was extremely comfy and cozy and quiet.  Breakfast is served in your time and is one of my favorite parts of the stay.  Every morning its something new and exciting and Delicious!!!  The Inn Keepers and warm and friendly and the conversation was never dull.  I will stay here whenever I'm in Madison.  The price and the service go way beyond the cost of any hotel I've stayed in...  This place is a real find.  There are also hiking trails, farm animals, and an abundantly beautiful property.  If that isn't enough a good deal of what is served for breakfast is grown on the property.    To say it in one word, AWESOME!!!!!"
5,Holy shit!! You must eat here!! I live in the Bay Area and I still get cravings for that sandwich with buffalo sauce and blue cheese on it!! Why can't they be here in CA?! And that front porch tho!!! So sunny and warm! The staff and the customers who come here are awsome!
5,"I love this market. it's my go-to spot for all things authentcaily hispanic. My wife's family is from Puerto Rico and I can find what I need to cook her home food here and hardly anywhere else in the city. They have everything you need for a hispanic feast or good ole barbecue! 

I like to rummage through the meat department, try one of the probably 20 different types of crema, pick up some fresh tortillas and get vegetables I can't normally get elsewhere. All in all, this is one of my favorite shopping places in Phoenix."
1,"This has been one of my regular spots for Italian beef since the 90's.  My trip today will be my last.   Luke's used to have their own beef that was tasty.  Well today they used some frozen Vienna beef that was like rubber, taste was not nearly the same and the color was off.  This made me sad since I've been a long time customer.  This isn't the first example of them cheapening out.  I guess I will have to go through the trouble of making my own Italian beef and will have to find a good jar giardiniera."
1,"The difficulty of finding a place to park was the first problem we encountered at Texaz, but after circling the block we saw someone backing out, parked and went into the restaurant. The noise level was too high, but we had so much time invested already that we decided to stay. 
My salad consisted of a mountain of lettuce on a plate that was too small for it. As I ate, bits fell off my plate no matter how careful I was. I gleaned so many pieces of lettuce from the table and my lap that I built a little hillock. When the waitress came for the plate I quickly scooped up the pile with my hands and put it on top of the remainder of the lettuce on the little plate. She asked me if I wanted a box for my ""salad.""  Really. The lettuce mess was neither my fault nor hers, and I realize it is the server's job to clear the table, but it did happen on my watch so I would have felt churlish leaving it for her to clean up. She had liberally sown the floor with morsels of food fallen from over-filled plates being carried to diners, but least the hostess was constantly sweeping up the mess on the floor.
After asking whether the rib eye or the New York would be the most tender I ordered the rib eye. When it came it took a monumental effort to cut it. I am strong, so I managed to hack off a couple of bites and finally complained that it was too tough. I was scolded for not ordering a filet in the first place and was asked if I would rather have that. It was a clumsy job of upselling, but I agreed to try one. As I waited for it to be cooked I couldn't keep from staring in morbid fascination at the ocean of gravy sloshing over the gunnel of the overfilled plate across from me. The so-called filet finally came and had the stringy texture of tenderized meat, not the buttery texture of a good filet, and it would have been a nice touch to comp me the difference between the rib eye and the filet, but I was charged the difference. The time to recommend the filet would have been when I first asked about tenderness, not after I had wrestled with the tough rib eye.
Our visit to Texaz is not one we will repeat.

PS Although we are seniors we would agree with the post below about the lack of seasoning. Some salt and a couple of squirts of Sriracha would work wonders."
1,"This location was a joke...me and my girlfriend went here while we were waiting for her cars oil to be changed at the brake Masters down the street. You stand in line like at a cafeteria and the people behind the counter dishing out your not so fresh food can barely speak English, the tray I picked up was sticky and dirty and had some type of half dried syrup on it and it was disgusting.  They served us and did not even give us silverware, or chopsticks to eat with, and the general decor of this restaurant looks like a ghetto Chinese buffet in crack central.  The floors and restaurant in general were D.I.R.T.Y. like Christina Aguilara dirty back in the day before she was a mom!!!! The food tasted like it had been sitting in a pan for 3 hours, and I would NEVER go to this place again, I was surprised I didn't find a finger or a needle or a cockroach in my plate of mushroom chicken with vegetables."
5,The whole chain of Barriques around the Madison area are wonderful.  This one boasts a fireplace that my friend and I spent hours in front of trying to stay warm last weekend.  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is cozy.  The extensive wine and liquor collection made me almost salivate. 5 stars.
1,"$10 cover, no hats, and they steal your ID.  How is this garbage still in business???"
5,"what a great place...the owner is very friendly, food awesome, and good value:  we will def. return!"
5,"When thinking BBQ you do not think of Madison,WI.  This is the one exception to that rule.  The food here is by hands down the best BBQ in Southern Wisconsin, there is nothing on the menu that you can go wrong with.  What is even better the award winning sauce does not mask or cover bad meat but creates an even better experience.  

Seating is limited and parking is even more so, you can park on the side road (Manley St)  off of Packers Ave."
1,"Only because I had to give it a star.. So first issue was chips and salsa.. Obviously salsa was made from canned chili or it sat for a long time.. Mushy and lacking in flavor. Chips were freezing cold, and greasy.. Not the good greasy, but more saturated..

I ordered the green chili.. Horrible, it was old meat, plate was cold, sauce was split.. Hardly consumable. Ate two bites and moved on.

Carne Asada mini tacos, meh.. Meat was again old and very dry.. Like eating sand. Yikes.. Limes were old, table wobbly, service was decent, wait was too long and I won't be back.

Overall not a good experience."
1,"Tom's Tavern does not care about its customers.  Well, at least not me.  I only ordered a beer and a dozen wings, but that doesn't mean it is okay to microwave me a plate of wings because a walking tour comes in and you are behind on being ready for them.  I paid for my beer and left.  What a sham.  I won't be back and I won't be recommending them of course.  You can make a mistake, of course, because nobody is ever perfect, but when alerted to the fact there was no attempt to make things right.  To me that is an establishment issuing the big ""F you"" to a potential repeat customer.  Unacceptable."
1,"Worst physician experience of my life. Spent a total of 10 minutes with the spine specialist, and that's only because I had the nurse bring him back into the room to spend more time with me. Got the bill today...$399 for 10 minutes! Unbelievable! I'm in the wrong industry if a specialist can literally not even examine a patient and make hundreds. Shameful."
1,"I was meeting a friend for lunch today at Oregano's. We got there promptly at 11 and got a parking spot and tablemmediately. We ordered calamari as a starter. This was the absolute worst calamari that I ever tasted! It didn't even look like calamari. It was thick strips that tasted very very fishy. I understand that calamari is seafood, but this tasted like bad fish, plus it was way over coated and salty. We sent it back and ordered fried ravioli. When it arrived, it too, was way over salted and tasted stale. We ate a few but didn't send it back. Next came our pizza. We ordered the lunch slices. The portion was a good size, but the pizza was very mediocre and the crust had the same stale flavor as the ravioli. Although the service was good, the food was very bad and I would not recommend Oregano's to anyone."
5,"Favorite BBQ ever! Absolutely love the sauce, I'd bathe in it if I could.

Get the pork ribs with a side of fries and mac m cheese. Just be sure to eat the fries while they're hot."
5,"Lettuce wraps 3x better than PF Changs. If Yelp reviewers consider PF changs 3 stars, then this gets 5.

Just to clear up for those who want authentic Chinese. Go to ICHIBAN NOW!!!"
5,After my warranty expired or non warranty issues for my 325I. I would only let Bavarian motors off of 16th St. service my car. No job to small and they always answer my calls and take my questions. Up front pricing. They honored their one year warranty when my gasket failed 11 months later. I'm always glad to see this shop get the jobs and get them done. Even if I wait to have my car serviced for minor or large issues no sweat off my back. You can leave the car there. I been a customer since 2008.
5,"Rosita's Place is one of my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Valley. I usually get the same thing everywhere I go and base my judgement on that one item. I order the green chili burro enchilida style. Rosita's offering was so good that I sometimes crave it and drive from Scottsdale just to get one. The salsa is always hot, and sometimes hotter, but very good. Just make sure you have your water in front of you before you try it. Any time I have out of town visitors, this is the place I take them."
1,"LAZY, UNPROFESSIONAL AND DOWNRIGHT RUDE. Three best words to explain what a horrific experience I had at this Danny's for the first (and most definitely last) time this last Tuesday. I had just gotten my car back from the shop and decided to get a full interior detail done. I live right off 16th and highland so it was a convenient choice. Well boy was I the fool to think 80 bucks would get me a somewhat decently clean car....to my shock it was actually WORSE then before I went in and wasted my money. They actually took a small contained coffee stain in the back seat and somehow spread the stain all over my cloth seats, w/ some of the stain moved onto the front passenger seat!! It was like they actually used the stain water to clean the entire car. There was a huge soap stain on the interior windshield, spilled sticky soda stains UNTOUCHED in the drink consul and on top of all of that, they soaped up my tires randomly (I didn't even buy an exterior wash) which irritated me as I pointed out to one idiot who remarked, ""oh it's to make them look shiny"" with an imbecile grin. HELLOO!!! Why not focus on the interior and actually get it done RIGHT?!? Utterly pathetic. I am still angry w/ myself for wasting my hard earned money to this joke of a business. I was so upset I took it back and the men who worked on my car the first time were all there and just stared at me with the rudest glares. Had the guy w/ the tattoos all over his head and face redo it, who actually did a little better. It's amazing this place is still in business let alone always so busy when I drive by, must be all new-timers about to be screwed out of their money...80 dollars down the drain, for a job my two year old daughter could have done better. The raids shouldn't have stopped with the illegals, should have arrested all of the LAZY WORKERS AND STAFF AS WELL!!"
5,Love love love this place!! I've been here for brunch and dinner and everything was amazing!! My bf says their burger is the best burger he has ever had and I have to agree. Super juicy!! The bumblebee is on point too!! I can't wait to go back and try the bacon cheddar fries :) I recommend this place to all my friends when they ask for a awesome place to eat downtown. And they are open late!!!
1,This company is HORRIBLE!! They don't know the meaning of customer service. If you are unlucky enough to have them assigned to you from Lowes or Home Depot request another service provider. The scheduler Julie is I must say the rudest customer service person I have had the displeasure of dealing with in a long time. They came out and looked at my leaking washing machine and my dryer. Said nothing was wrong. After they tech left I found a scratch on my washing machine glass top. This company is full of crack pots who need a reality check. Nice job Julie!
1,"I have been living here since July 2013 and I can not wait until my lease is over! The staff appeared to be friendly and helpful until I actually moved in! Shortly after I moved in we had an ant problem in the first week. I went to the office so I could be put on the pest control list and the ants never went away so I had to buy my own bug spray and fix the problem.
Then about a month into being moved in the lock on my front door came completely out. When my bf told the office that our lock was broken and we both had work that day the lady told him someone should be there to fix it within the next hour. When I went on my break 4 hours later I called the office to make sure my house was locked and they told me no one had been there yet. Finally someone got there but they installed the new lock wrong and it's always a hassle to lock or unlock my door now. 
  A few months after this I went to get a direct tv installment paper signed by the office and the First Lady I spoke with I could barely understand and she seemed to not know what she was doing. Then the property manager came out after I asked the First Lady if I could speak with her and she wouldn't go get her for me, and the manager was extremely rude about the situation with me. 
Also my laundry room closet door fell off the tracks completely one day and almost fell on my head. There are also a lot minor reports that weren't made before I moved in. 
 Lastly this week my boyfriend got his car out of the shop after 5 months and the tags he had were expired the day after we brought the car home the management put a tow away sticker on his car even though it was parked in an uncovered parking space and was doing nothing to anyone. 
Anyone who is looking for a place that has a good management run complex DO NOT GO HERE! The staff is very rude."
1,"The WORST customer service experience I have ever had.
 They have no courtesy or manners what so ever."
5,"I have to say of all the Thai Restaurants that I have ever been to , and there has been a lot. This is my absolute favorite.
Every time I walk in here the smell is amazing.
For years we have come here,ever since It first opened.
It is family owned and every thing is cooked when you order it.

It is always good. In all these years I have never once not liked what I have gotten here.
We even got food to go from here on New Years Eve! It too was AWESOME!
Just thinking about it makes me want to eat here every day, not just Fort nightly.
Bathrooms are always nice and clean. Plus lots of parking in the back.
Easy to find, right on Central and right next to Durants."
1,"I went to Jerry's last night for dinner.  We always eat there and usually like the atmosphere.  This time there were protesters there with anti-Nazi signs.  They told me that a man was present signing books and speaking to a group of people.  His name is David Irving and he was invited to speak by the group about his beliefs that the Holocaust didn't happen.  And that Hitler never knew about the Jews being slaughtered.  This is sick and made me lose my appetite.  Why would a restaurant like Jerry's support a local Neo-Nazi group?  Apparently, they hold the monthly meetings of the group there as well.  I do not plan to return to this location for any meal in case I run across this type of hatred again.
4.9.12 Since that time, I have been following the story of David Irving.  He has not returned to this restaurant again but went to a hotel near the airport maybe a year later.  It was guarded by the Phx police red squad.  At least the protesters wacked this mole back into his hole for now."
1,"Had a hitch installed on my Subaru. Paid in advance and made an appointment time for 7am weeks in advance, and confirmed by employees.

Was specifically told it would take no longer than an hour, but having an got and a half availability would be safe just in case. Three hours later I still don't have my vehicle back and it didn't look like that'll happen anytime soon. No recognition from staff that this is an issue. I was told ""ten more minutes"" 45 minutes ago and they are still soldering wires.....

This is a 45 minute job to do! Not a good sign that they know what they're doing, and they certainly don't care about service expectations.

Poor job, UHAUL. Don't use this location."
1,"Northlight, their front counter employees and their office manager seem to be more interested in getting your money than they are in getting you better. They are one of those companies who catch phrases are, ""You owe us $____"" and ""Our policy is _____"". I was actually starting to establish a good rapport with the providers I was working with, if they moved to a different company I would seek them out but never EVER again will I consider dealing with Northlight Counseling! In fact, Lindsey, the office manager was always extremely combative and added to my depression and during our last interaction actually suggested that I, ""Find another company who's policies I approve of"". In my opinion, that's not very sensitive handling of a patient who is in need of help with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I've been to numerous counseling places and have never been told to get lost before! I will miss working with Dr. Hicks, he is a very good psych and I will miss working with Dr. Davidson as well but when the office that is supposed to be helping you starts turning into the reason that you need to go there, it's time to get out."
1,"Guys. Seriously? This place is not living up to the hype. My husband and I went here for an overnight stay to celebrate the fact that it was our first time away from our kids, um ever in two years (no big deal) and it was a Father's Day gift. We had booked through hotels.com and relayed the importance of our visit in the reservation. I upgraded the room to a private casita and chose the option to pay at the time of the booking, as opposed to paying later. 
Imagine my surprise when, upon check-in, I am confronted immediately with,""we need a credit card for this reservation"".  ""I thought I paid ahead, but ok....""  The front desk attendant then informs us of the $30 resort fee and $15 overnight parking fee. Really? Y'all can't even spring for free parking for your patrons? At a so-called 4.5 star resort? Please. 
The valet gave us a tour of the grounds and he was great. Informative, funny and honest. When we tipped him he made sure we knew that a tip was already included and wasn't necessary. We knew but he deserved the tip anyway, it was just nice of him to be honest.

The stay was nice, the room was fine and dinner was good-but for a $250 check for two people I was expecting more. But what was really great happened next. Once we got home a few days passed and I spoke to my mom. She said she was surprised she didn't hear from me for a big thank you. I asked why? Well it turned out my parents paid for our stay as a nice gesture since we never get out. Odd, I thought, considering the first thing the front desk attendant did was ask for a credit card when my parents sent their info in and wanted to pay for any other incidentals above and beyond the room. I called and talked to the front desk attendant and told her the deal. She didn't sympathize, she didn't apologize, she just transferred me to the accounting department to leave a message. The following day, Eric from accounting called me back. We figured out that my card wasn't charged but there was a $300 hold on my debit that would ""disappear in a week or so"". Now, I don't have a lot of money, so for $300 to be tied up for a week was kind of a bummer. He keep repeating the same info about booking through hotels.com and how sometimes people who pay for rooms want to remain anonymous (I was asking why I wasn't told the room was paid for, why was I even asked to present a card when that part was handled?). He was droning on and I said, ""I don't care about that, what I care about is..."" I couldn't finish my sentence because Eric from accounting interrupted me and said that if I didn't care what he was saying he couldn't help me any further. Then he HUNG UP ON ME! I mean come on! Where's the hospitality? I was furious. I wanted to be done with the shitty ordeal but my friend persuaded me to call again and let management know what happened. So I did. I told her that I didn't want anything from them, that I simply would never come back. She assured me that she would take this higher and have it corrected. With all the awesome deals in the valley during the summer why throw it away on this place? Spend your hard earned money some place else."
5,"Small.  Great food.  Great price,  exceptional staff.  If your downtown,  try this place.  The servings are good sized and the quality is hard to beat.  Fresh taste.  Will be back."
1,"I called four times last night to place a to-go order (7:30p-8p) and got their recording each time.  Either this place is SO busy they can't get to the phone or they had closed up early and went home.  

I'm still craving Thai...and looking for a great place in Central Phoenix.  Any other suggestions or should I give this place another chance?"
1,"just grabbed lunch there today. Had the all white meat Teriyaki bowl. It is dry and flavorless. Is it really chicken? Turkey or pigeon I think, well at least it's some bird flesh from what I can tell by looks. Sauce is flat and lacks flavor. No thrills about a bowl with a little rice and a large portion of meat. No garnish nothing. Brought it home and fed it to my dog. She enjoyed it. I want be returning and I'm disappointed that all of you think it's so great, the place doesn't even have atmosphere to like."
5,"dr. goldberg offers everything i look for in a general practitioner.  he's nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing; he's always on time in seeing his patients; he's affiliated with a top-notch hospital (nyu) which my parents have explained to me is very important in case something happens and you need surgery; and you can get referrals to see specialists without having to see him first.  really, what more do you need?  i'm sitting here trying to think of any complaints i have about him, but i'm really drawing a blank."
5,Great customer service! I recently bought a HE washing machine from here. Friendly service and great last minute help. We will be going back here for any other appliance needs.
5,"The Staff was friendly, helpful,  and informative and the museum itself was clean.  We went yesterday and had a blast.  The food in the cafeteria was actually good and reasonably priced.  The only downside is that it is VERY EXPENSIVE.  Your admission fee doesn't cover an special exhibits or shows so be prepared to spend big bucks."
1,"Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no no"
5,Well since the last time I talked to you all about this arena....I have been to many Phoenix Mercury games.....and I was even at Arena Bowl to see the Rattlers. However last night was my first concert experience at U.S. Airways Center. I went to see John Legend and Sade....and it was a show to which I have no words....but trust me it was Sultry and I was in a total trance the whole time. The arena was set up very nicely for the Sellout Crowd....other than having some better organization....I will definitely return for another concert in the future.
1,45 minutes for two veggie rolls....Ridiculous. Little explanation or apology and no discount....Unacceptable......very disappointed.
5,"Monty's is a place you can go where the veg selections don't feel like an afterthought.  Order ""The Sheldon""...  Trust me.  Also, amazing waitstaff and very good coffee"
5,"Don't let the seedy location fool ya, this place is the bomb, serving up some of the most authentic Mexican I've ever tasted.

Your experience will begin with parking in the rear of the place. As you make the long walk to the front entrance, you'll disregard any conversation with others in your party as you worry whether or not your car will be there after dinner. It will and here's why.

As you make your way to the front of the parking lot, you'll notice an old Mexican man, (actually a cliche or sorts, complete with sombrero and serape) sitting, vigilantly keeping an eye on your vehicle and everyone else's. 
This should calm you down, enough so that you're able to re-join the conversation. Now get inside and get ready for a cold Mexican beer and a pitcher of Margaritas. 

Their chips are gratis and served warm. A nice treat,. They offer red salsa, hot sauce, and tomatillo green sauce which is spectacularly hot.

Every item on their menu is delicious, but my preference is either the Machaca burrito, or the Chicken Mole. Their mole sauce is off the charts good. Not too much chocolate, not too much chile, just right. 

What I really love is the black and white photos of old Mexican bandits, governors, rabble rousers, war hero, ex-Presidents and others. 

Here's my suggestion.
Go on a weeknight when they're not busy. In this way, you can make your way around the room and get a close up look at the images, which in my opinion are worth a look,.

The food, ambiance, service are all superb. 
This is the place where I take out-of towner's when they say they want 'real' Mexican food. 
This is also the place where your butt-hole will curse you the next day if you don't listen to him and ease up on the salsa."
5,"I love that the best of this classic Wisconsin tavern was preserved whilst providing a much-needed facelift. It's a great addition to the neighborhood.

We were there the week it opened and I enjoyed a few creative cocktails. My husband, a beer aficionado, loved the beer list, which includes 2 nitro taps.

We were there again last night with friends for the fish fry. When I read the menu, I was intrigued by the Rooster sandwich, which is essentially a BLT + fried egg. I'm so glad I tried this instead of the fish because it was really good. It's such a large sandwich, though, it is probably better to split with a friend. I can't believe I'm going to write this, but there may have been TOO much bacon (although I managed to eat the entire thing)! If you love bacon, this is the sandwich for you!

My husband had the fish, which was a nice piece of walleye and perfectly fried. He doesn't normally like cole slaw but specifically noted how much he liked the slaw. He also liked the tartar sauce, and said it was enhanced with dill.

We live less than 2 miles from Tip Top, so we look forward to spending more time there, especially when we can bike there during warmer months!"
1,"The Mac & Gaydos show is without question the worst show on radio.  These guys have NO Class what so ever.  Today our community buried a fallen police officer shot in the line of duty while responding to a burglary call.  The officer was 50 years old with a few young kids and has given his entire life to protect and serve our community.

YET, Mac & Gaydos today ridiculed the closure of hwy 51 for 1 hour.  They made a big issue out of nothing.  It was in very POOR Taste and has turned me off of ever listening to this station again.

POOR FORM KTAR ....."
1,The food was okay and the atmosphere was nice. Unfortunately the service was absolutely appalling. It took 30 minutes just for the waitress to take our drink order and another 30 for her to take our food order. She took even longer to collect the bill and run our card. We could see her chatting behind the counter with another employee. My boyfriend had to walk up to the counter to ask her to run our card as we had been waiting for so long. Considering there was only one other table in the whole restaurant this was ridiculous. Extremely disappointed with my experience and I will not be coming back.
1,Sloooooowwwwwwwww. Couldn't believe how long it took to be served below mediocre food.
5,"AMAZING!!!!!

There is reason for long lines, and full parking lot. the food is Amazing!!
I am a hard critic when it comes to any restaurant. This place is great in ALL areas, This place has awesome seafood, from fresh fish fillets, shrimp and more. The other fare is awesome too, from the enchiladas, burritos and everything else. You can tell they go extra mile to make sure the food is perfect, and spiced perfectly. This is my go to place for Mexican food and Seafood fare..

Comedor Guadalajara is the Real Deal!!!"
1,"one of the most dissatisfying breakfast omelets we ever had. hash browns were under cooked, greasy and cold. we usually appreciate the service from a guy waiter....not this one. ATTITUDE seem to be a problem at this restaurant. hate leaving a restaurant hungry after spending $20 for breakfast for 2."
1,"Uuugh...I went here for father's day again with the family this morning....I think this should probably be the last visit. It was fairly empty in there this morning (probably a pretty bad sign given that it is father's day). We sat at a large round table in the back of the restaurant. The service was actually fair today except the waitress forgot much of the food ordered and had to make several trips to get everyone their food. Speaking of the food, it was pretty terrible. I had the two egg breakfast with eggs over medium. The eggs were overcooked (closer to over hard) and everything on my plate tasted like burnt bacon. I did not order bacon. Turns out everyone's food tasted like burnt bacon because they don't properly clean their flat top or pans or whatever they cook on. The potatoes were inedible....soggy and flavored like....burnt bacon. My bagel was burnt on the side with the toppings and soft on the side that should be toasted. My brother, Scott O., had pancakes which he said tasted bland. The BF had latkes which were thick, burnt, and somehow not crispy. The applesauce that came with it was so watery...almost like apple juice. No one enjoyed the food, and we are Jewish (btw) so we are very familiar with Jewish food and Jewish delis. With so many good breakfast restaurants in Phoenix, there is no excuse to come here. Honestly, I would have rather eaten at home."
5,"Love the Sorge!

These people are fantastic-o! Really fair prices. Great customer service."
1,"Will never be back and will tell everyone I know how terrible and unsafe this place is! Today at 2 pm, John at the beginning of the line took forever to get to me - checking in 3 other people who arrived after me.  Then he asks if I wand the floors and mats cleaned and I said yes if it was fast - I asked him 3 times and told him very clearly that it had to be done fast since I had another appointment.  ""Yes, yes, fast, I know"" is what he said.  50 minutes later I asked another guy to check on my car and he comes back to tell me it will be another 45 minutes!  That guy was really nice but I was now very late for another appointment.  I watched 3 of them gather at my car, stop work and just start talking.  I waited 7 minutes to see if they would start again and finally walked over to the car to see what was going on.  Those folks were very nice but then John walked up and told me that it was my fault because my carpets were so dirty and that he never made any promises to me.  I disagreed and did raise my voice, but never yelled, when I said, ""oh so this is my fault?"" He immediately took a step closer, got in my face screaming at me not to yell at him and that I ""disrespected"" him all while pointing his finger less than inch from my face. I told him, very quietly and very sternly to ""Walk away John, Walk away now"" and he just kept going, backing me up until another very nice worker stepped in and had to physically push him away from me. FYI, I am a woman and I was alone today.  I can't remember the nice guy's name as I was pretty shaken at this point but he had a black bow tie on and he was great, apologizing and trying to make it right.  I told him that at this point i didn't feel safe staying there and to just give me my car.  It took forever since their spin dryer for the mats wasn't working and I drove home with sopping wet mats in the back of my car and quite upset.  I'm still upset and am considering filing a report with the police.  There were dozens of witnesses and one customer even stopped to give me his business card telling me to share his info if I decided to file a report.  And as for the rest of it, there were spots all over my car, 2 windows not cleaned and more crap work.  The store was a trash heap - empty racks, dirty floor, etc.  Disgusting all the way around.  If you value your safety, stay away or don't dare complain."
1,This review is for tires/automotive - I made an appointment (the only time they take appointments) to get my '06 VW Jetta an alignment.  I got there at the appointment time.  45 minutes later I saw my car still sitting in the lot.  I asked the guy at the counter and he said he would check with the technician.  He came back shortly thereafter and apologized and said they couldn't do an alignment on my car because it was a VW and they didn't have the right tools.  What a joke.  Thanks for wasting my time.   So I want to CV Pros on East Wash and they had me in and out in an hour!  That's the last time I will get my car serviced at Farm and Fleet in Madison.
1,"The hostess didn't acknowledge us, she just stayed on phone while we stood. Finally someone came from the back to seat us in the nearly empty restaurant. I said ""Thank you."" She instantly shot back curtly, ""I can dish out attitude too!"" Taken by surprise I retorted, ""If you think that was attitude you've never seen attitude."" Believe me, there wasn't any intention to give her attitude, after all she helped us as soon as she saw us, so I was happy with her. In any case, it was an unprofessional way to deal with the situation.

It took about 10 minutes for our actual waiter to come to ask us what we wanted to drink. Still he answered our questions well, even if they didn't turn out to be 100% factual, he helped stear our decisions. There were spicy honey wings that we were interested in, but I can't stand the chilli vinegar taste/smell of buffalo sauce...I asked him, ""Is it light on the buffalo and heavy on the honey?"" he answered yes. INCORRECT. Probably the strongest buffalo tasting/smelling chicken I've even been close to. I had to push it further to the other side of the table to keep my eyes from watering.

Oh and Faux news...err I mean Fox not-really News was playing on the TV in the bar :/

Lame. I'm not going back."
5,"Now, I know there are science centers in every major city. But right here in downtown Phoenix, we've got one that's world class. The Arizona Science Center holds more than 40,000 square-feet of gallery space and over 300 hands-on exhibits. Great for the kids, the relatives, even for a unique first date. 

Here on limited engagement, the Body Worlds3 exhibit is an amazing collection of 200 authentic human specimens! Not for the faint (and probably not for younger children without a lot of explanation), the display include skeletons, individual organs, transparent body slices, as well as entire bodies."
5,"I love this place!!

The chips and salsa are fantastic, I couldn't stop eating them.  The food was excellent, the service was prompt and friendly, and even the desert was delicious (tres leches)!

We went on a Friday night and were one of the only ones in the restaurant, which surprised me.  We also ordered a margarita (one of the ones large enough to share) and it was perfectly prepared.

I look forward to coming here again and highly recommend giving it a shot if you haven't yet.  The free dessert Yelp coupon alone makes it worthwhile!"
5,"OH!  MY!  GOD! 
I don't understand how anyone could give this place less than 5 stars... Food is incredible, staff are friendly and welcoming, and the drinks are delicious, especially the Hurricane. I had the Carrie pulled pork sandwich and I can honestly say it was one of the best meals I have ever had. EVER! 
Don't listen to these winey bitches who give three stars... They obviously don't understand good food and good service. Would eat here every day if I didn't live so far away. Wow"
1,"After sitting at our table for 30 minutes and not getting any service, we left.  But not before the hostess said thanks for coming in. Needles to say I will not be returning."
1,"The food is average to slightly above average. That isn't what is wrong with Cherry Blossom.

The problem with Cherry Blossom is the service which seems to be getting worse. I have taken my family there at least a dozen times and it appears as if the service which was so-so to begin with has deteriorated to just plain incompetent. Today was the final straw. My wife and I arrived there at 11:35 am for an early lunch and while the place was not empty, it was not packed either. We were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived. The server promptly took our drink order and brought it to us. She said she'd give us a few minutes to look over the menu. A few minutes went by, then another few minutes, then another and by 11:57, our order had still not been taken. At that point, my wife flagged down the host who took our order. I should point out that both my wife and I had ordered two simple lunch items from the menu without any substitutions or special requests. Two minutes later (around 11:59) our server appeared and asked if we had decided what we wanted. After informing her that we just gave our order to the host, she vanished. Both our orders were supposed to come with soup and salad and still by 12:14, neither had arrived. At that point, more people had arrived and the several tables in the back room where we were had become occupied. We also noticed that these customers, who arrived well after we had, had been served their salads, soups and even their meals while we sat there waiting. At that point I went to speak with the host about where our missing salads and soups were and she smiled politely but did not respond. My wife and I decided we were not going to pay for such incompetent service and just walked out. The last time I was there, the service was slow and they did not bring one of the salads for one of the meals we ordered. Other times we have gone there and waited 10 minutes to even be asked for our drink order when the place was not even half full. It just seems to get worse and worse at Cherry Blossom.

So in conclusion. If you enjoy sitting and waiting while watching other customers who walked in 10 or 15 minutes or more after you did get their orders taken and served their food, this is the place for you. It is my belief that management is to blame for Cherry Blossom's poor service. Fortunately, I can take my money and spend it elsewhere and that's just what we did after we left. Cherry Blossom will not be getting any more visits from us."
1,"First time trying the place. Had my doubts and my doubts were right. Cute place, cute menu but god awful food. Started off with potato crunchers (jalapeno like poppers) $4.99 those were good but the food didn't make up for the poppers. Ordered the honey fried chicken (8.99) which comes with: carrots, side salad (horrible), cornbread (inedible) and french fries (good). Husband had chix fried steak. BLECH!!! that's all I can say. I really liked the carrots and though they were the bet part of the meal. Let's just say don't waste your time."
5,"I was extremely happy with my meal here.  The salsa with the chips was nicely spicy.  I had the shrimp and octopus a la Diavolo.  The Diavolo sauce was delicious and also spicy in a different way than the salsa for the chips.  I was given a large flour tortilla and couldn't resist dipping and redipping.  The sides of salad (standard shredded lettuce, etc., but very fresh and crunchy), rice and refried beans were substantial.  After the chips, main course, salad rice and tortilla I couldn't do more than scratch the surface of the refried beans.  

I was equally happy with the atmosphere and service.  I showed up near 1pm on Sunday as a single diner.  Most of the other people were family groups, many apparently regulars.  I was nonetheless given a decent table normally seating four after the promised 10-15 minute wait and no sense of being rushed or treated differently by any of the staff.  Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be eager to come back (bringing family and/or friends) and have the same thing again and/or explore the rest of the menu."
5,"Always great coffee, and always friendly, upbeat baristas!  I love this place and I highly recommend it.  The drive thru is very convienent.  And they have almost any flavored syrup imaginable!"
1,"I've been practicing bikram yoga for about eight years and have had the opportunity to attend classes all over the US and abroad. It's always fun to try a new studio and experience new teachers. 

Unfortunately, Bikram's Yoga College of India in Central Phoenix was one of the worst classes and studios I've ever experienced. 

The smell of the studio was so absolutely disgusting (dirty, wet dog combined with urine) that I nearly lost it when I walked in. I opted to stay because I really wanted to get a class in. On top of the awful stench, the teacher sucked. She had us hold poses longer  the second time through and shorter the first time. Many of the students had really poor technique (I know, you shouldn't worry about others...it's your own practice), however, I thought it was an indication about the poor quality of instruction.

It's unfortunate the hygiene wasn't up to par. It's bad for bikram and damn, it's really inconvenient for me. I travel to PHX a lot and I love to grab a class. Well, I'm going to try out one of the other studios in town. 

Thank goodness they've got some competition!"
5,"Free and much larger than I expected, this botanical garden was a pleasant surprise.  There are a few corners that are particularly nice, like the Rose Tower and Temple. Meander throughout and try to get lost. Sit a spell on a bench and enjoy the scenery."
5,"Since moving to DC a year and a half ago, I continue returning to Madison frequently to get my hair done by Tiffany.  She's the only one I'll let touch my hair and I always leave feeling like a million bucks!  Not only is she a wonderful stylist, she's become a good friend of mine and I don't think I'm the only client of hers that feels that way."
1,"Absolute worst Mexican food I have ever eaten, period. 

It's like Mexican food for people who don't like Mexican food. Much of the food had little taste to it. I would rather eat Taco Bell, and I don't like Taco Bell."
5,"I had the pleasure of (finally) eating at Welcome Diner today and it was amazing! I can't wait to go back. 

I had the fried chicken biscuit sandwich and a side of fried avocado, both of which were great. Fried chicken was juicy and biscuit was flaky and tasted fresh. The fried avocado was awesome and like nothing I have had before. 

My friend got a collard green sandwich with a fried egg on top. She smashed it and then raved about how great it was. Each sandwich came with a side of fruit which was the perfect side for the heavy sandwiches. 

Like I said before I can't wait to go back!! Highly recommend, this is a local gem that I would love to see thrive."
5,"I had a great experience with Union Cab when I used them to take me to my rental car for a trip out of town.  The phone answerer set up a time call for me, and the driver arrived two minutes before the time I requested, so I didn't have to wait at all.  On the way there, he advised me on how to get reimbursed for my cab ride by the car rental company and a good place in town to purchase tires for my car without breaking my budget.  Really nice guy.  Clean car.  Altogether, above and beyond."
5,"I'm not familiar with the theater, but this was a really nice experience for me and my family. The stage is kind of small and intimate, but the balcony is really roomy and nice. The exterior is really pretty and old and full of character."
5,"I go to this SB's every morning on my way to work. The staff all know me by name, scream good morning to me as I haul my sleepy ass in there every morning and they know what I want and make it fast.  My hat goes off to Misty, Thomas, Jade and all the others who get me in & out as fast as they can and with a smile."
5,"Great tasting food, great service and has been around for years. Presence was a mystery to Me for awhile so maybe an Improvement could be better, more recognizable signage out front or up above. Other than that, it's a hidden gem here in downtown"
5,"Perry has been cutting my hair for about 4 to 5 years.  Whenever I walk out of there I cannot believe how my hair looks, and I oftern get complete strangers complimenting my cut.  Perry does a great job of taking my preferences and developing cuts that flatter me. What more can I ask?

The  massage before the shampoo is standard and more than once I've fallen asleep.  Once a couple years ago, in the late afernoon of a particularly frustrating day at work, they asked if I wanted anything to drink.  I said, only if you have vodka.  Next thing I know, a clear drink on ice shows up...and tasted suspiciously like vodka.  No that's customer service."
1,"""Hey, Kerstin! Why are you eating a grilled cheese for dinner? Didn't you just eat out?""

""Yeah, but we ate at Miracle Mile.""

'Nuf said, really, but our experience was such an epic fail, I must elaborate a bit. This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.

I got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager ""saved"" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. ""Why don't you like caraway?"" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, ""I really don't like the taste."" When she asked me ""Why?"" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the ""sauce"" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that ""real"" texture. Foul, foul, foul. 

Hence, the grilled cheese."
1,This used to be my favorite restaurant for special occasions.  Such a dissapointment when we went there in July for our anniversary.  Service was just teriible.  So understaffed.  My fish was overcooked and no apology made when I had it sent back.  I used to just love this restaurant - all the history and fine service  Not anymore.  The matredee stood at his desk gossiping with 2 friends while we waited and waited to be acknowledged.  Sad......this used to be one of the best.
1,"I must have gone on a bad day, because this is possibly the worst mexican food I've had. Honestly, tasted like Taco Bell on a poor day. I ordered a California burrito, for almost $10. The tortilla was stale, and the flavor was just not there. Being from California, I'm offended that they call this a California burrito!
Other than that, the salsa was not fresh at all, and I'm guessing it came straight out of a can. Not even a jar-- a can.
Overpriced, stale fast-food. How has this place been there so long?! I felt robbed after seeing the bill."
5,"First of all, this is Culvers.  I love the mushroom and swiss burger, delicious, I crave it and I am not a fast food person!   They custards are to die for and I am glad that I do not live by a culvers because I would probably try to eat there every day!  I love their food, service has always been great here!"
1,"I had color copies made here. The staff did not know the prices and then they charged me $1.50 for me to use their computer to access the file from my flash drive. The computer was so out of date it could not even read a Word 2007 file. When I looked at the copies the next morning they were misaligned and the print quality looked like a poor inkjet rather than a laser print.

I called them and they said they would have to talk to the manager. When I went back after the weekend, he was not there and the clerk would not give me a refund.

Poor equipment

Poor attitude

Poor customer service.

There are other UPS stores relatively close. I suggest you use those. I will stick to my local one in Ahwatukee."
5,"I found Beckett Tax through Yelp. I saw Brianne, who prepared my taxes. She was friendly, helpful, and professional. Best of all: I ended up paying less for my tax preparation than I had at a different tax preparer (about half as much). I'll be recommending Beckett Tax & Accounting to all my friends. They're even open Saturday and Sunday the weekend before taxes are due! Procrastinators rejoice!"
1,Client service is awful. Nobody knows what they can or can't do. Waited on manager to come over to see if they could sell a video game and he said if it's not our policy we can't. Real qualified manager if u don't know the policies. Have had bad experiences multiple times at this location maybe why they have such bad ratings. Try and help the client that is your job don't just try and find every reason why u can't help.
1,"I'm sorry but this place probably has the worst turkey club i have ever had. thick sliced lunchable meat with regular american cheese, bacon, lettuce tomato. on a hot toasty bun... didn't quite sit right, i probably ordered the worst thing on the menu. but i wasn't to crazy about the potato chunk fried fries either..... but what do i know! the chicken fried steak is probably awesome, but i needed something light and quick at the time! 

the place was really dirty above your head no telling whats getting on the food that you are about to eat. and all the walls were super cluttered with decor, and dusty hats hanging everywhere, kind of gross.

service was awesome, and the people were cool. but not enough to come back to."
1,"More a business then a clinic.. a certain degree of care for the animals, but in my opinion and experience, it's all about the almighty dollar there.  I felt my pet was second over how much they could nickel and dime me for.  After $$$$ dollars spent, I went to another vet who put the animal first with the cost secondary.  Again, my opinion only, not my type of vet clinic."
1,"Was hoping to get the right parts for our leaky shower handle.  Its a sad day when YouTube is more helpful then these employees.  As my wife points out, the first guy wouldn't even look away from the boxes he was breaking down."
5,"After a few recommendations, I finally paid a visit to this restaurant.  I'm glad I did because it was really great!  The building isn't the nicest but the food certainly makes up for it.

I ordered a few dishes for our family.  The Beef Chow Fun was my favorite.  This noodle dish has really great flavor.  We also ordered the Mongolian beef and Chicken with Garlic sauce; both were fantastic!  Our last dish that we ordered was the Green Curry with Chicken.  This was also good, a little spicy and a little sweet.

Overall, our meal was really good and we will definitely be coming back here again."
5,"Finally, I had a chance to try the Pad Thai. This is the best I've ever had: loaded with lots of sauce, so very peanutty, sweet and salty at the same time. And it had tons of fresh bean sprouts, cabbage, and cilantro that is great when mixed in with the hot noodles. I will definitely order this dish again, but just wished that there were more than just 2 shrimp in it."
5,"I came here with my boyfriend for the very first time last night. We loved it!!                   A great venue, small and intimate. Nice soft seats, done in red velor.                                 It is a small Theater,so it makes it so easy to see the performance very clearly.  Everyone that works here is very friendly. The attendants were very helpful..The bathrooms are very clean and automated.                                                                                        There is even a snack bar with consumer friendly prices. You make take your bottled water in the Theater with you as well.  We saw the show Daddy Long Legs, i loved it so!   It was a great story and so well done.  What a brilliant performance!! Wonderful singing. Lots of parking and restaurants around so you can eat before you go. We will be back and looking forward to it!"
1,"Very rude Service. Walked in at 4:40pm. The place was totally empty. The only other customer in the place was leaving. I was then led to a small table in the back. I asked if I could move to a larger table in the front next to the wall. I was told NO! I have to sit in the back where I could smell the bathrooms. Unbelievable over 50 empty tables and I was told I have to sit there.

I then immediately walked out! Don't have to spend my $$ at a place that is so unfriendly towards it's customers."
5,"Coronado Cafe had been on our list for a long time and we were finally able to put a big exceptional check mark next to it!

We were meandering down 7th St. trying to decide where we should eat. When the Coronado Cafe sign was with in sight, it truly was ""SIGN"" to eat there.

What a great place to have a meal!  Everyone mentioned how intimate and cozy the inside of this restaurant was and they were correct.  The wait staff was also perfectly attentive.

We ordered a margarita and sangria.  Jeannie loved her sangria and my margarita (just the plain house version) was very tasty.  

We agreed that we wanted to share a few small dishes.  The crab cakes and scallops proved to be a super tasty start.  We highly recommend both!

Each of us ordered a Greek salad.  It was a little too tart for me, but Jeannie enjoyed hers and helped me with mine.

Finished off our shared meal with the special of the day.  It was halibut with a parsnip puree and steamed veggies.  The fish tasted very fresh and the parsnip puree was enjoyed more by me than the lovely wife.  

Everything we ordered was a reflection of the cafe itself...delicately seasoned, prepared, and presented. Getting to enjoy carefully prepared food and drinks while in a perfectly simple setting was time well spent.

Coronado Cafe is a must try for everyone. Enjoy it with your sweetheart or a great friend (more than 4 people to your group would seem too much...at least to us!)  I wouldn't recommend taking small kids."
1,"I can't comment on the selection of items, because I barely made it through the door. The staff at this store is very rude. 

I specifically drove here because I was excited to see what they have here. I LOVE stationery and paper goods and am nostalgic for my favorite stores of that kind from my time living on the east coast. It was 3:55pm on a Saturday, and apparently they close at 4 (I didn't know). 

When my husband and I walked in, two store people were at the register helping another customer. Instead of greeting me, they looked at my with shock to see me and asked emphatically, ""Can I help you?"" As though I were in the wrong place. 

At first I thought I must be confused, that I'd walked into an appointment-only card shop. Realizing they were closing a few minutes later, I explained I had driven to come see the store and that I hadn't realized they were closing soon, and I made a motion for the door. Realizing their own rudeness and perhaps that another customer was watching this, they begrudgingly mumbled something about how I could stay but it was clearly half-hearted. ""Come back another time!"" they said. 

I absolutely will not be coming back another time because that behavior was nuts! I worked many boutique retail jobs throughout college and would never have treated a customer that way. In fact, as a rule of thumb, most small shops don't mention closing time to customers until after they've closed, and then only to explain why you're locking the door or pulling down displays (gentle coaxing that you are winding down). 

They definitely lost a customer today--and for all future visits. 

I also never write Yelp reviews--I just was so bowled over by the terrible customer service that I felt compelled in hopes that other people won't waste a trip."
5,Yummy food! Great service! Family friendly atmosphere! Great Prices!
1,"I was here recently for a girls birthday party and had I known what I was getting myself into I would have opted out all together!  This place is for lack of a better word, simply the worst!   I ordered the fish basket, which for Wisconsin should never be bad.  I was wrong.  I was very wrong!  

It was advertised as a fish fry when it should have been advertised a Van de Kamp's frozen dinner.  I mean I could have gone to the freezer section of my neighborhood grocery store and gotten a better meal.  It also came with these really just terrible fries that reminded me of the shoestring fries that my mom used to buy, they were bad!  Oh and did I mention cold?  Oh I didn't?  Okay, then let me do it now:  the food was cold!

I would never go to this place again.  Furthermore, I would deter anyone saying that they were going to this restaurant from going."
1,"My usual handyman was sick so he recommended Steve at A-Accent Plumbing to install a new sprayer head for my kitchen faucet. I had already purchased the part so it was (I thought) a simple matter of attaching it. The plumber arrived very promptly - the same day I called. He was finished in 30 minutes, charged me $98 for an hour's labor & left. I thought it was a lot but hey!  He came & fixed my problem quickly. Fast-forward 2 weeks. The sprayer head fell off in my hand. My handyman came to see what was wrong and told me it wasn't installed correctly & he would speak to Steve about the issue. Steve, however, was completely ""unresponsive"" (handyman's words). No fix, no refund, no nothing. I will NEVER use this company again & will encourage anyone who asks to go elsewhere for their plumbing needs. This is the first negative review I have ever written."
1,Disgusting!  Had a Groupon so my daughter and I tried it out.  Very outdated and gaudy 80's style interior made me feel like I was in an episode of Sopranos.  The food itself was pretty bad.  We ordered pretty simple dishes but they just had no flavor at all!  After trying it out I'm positive all the good reviews on here are employees or owners creating them.
1,"My dad and I went here thinking it would be a good place to try. The inside of the restaurant was unclean and tacky. Neither my dad nor I were impressed with the food. We both had ribs. There was very little BBQ sauce on the ribs, and while our food came out fast the quality was not great."
1,"Repulsive. It's plain white rice with Teriyaki sauce and some disgusting bits of chicken. I made the mistake of not ordering the bowl ""white meat only"" and ended up with a bowl of fat, gristle, skin, cartilage, and odd-tasting bits that I couldn't identify. This is a $6 bowl of disgusting crap. I'm told that the ""white meat only"" option is important. I don't care. Nobody should serve that, ever. 

If you want a decent teriyaki bowl that won't make you want to vomit, go to Costco and get their frozen bowls. I can't remember the brand, but it's got veggies, delicious white meat (with a lot of flavor), rice, and sauce. It comes out to about $1.30 per bowl. 

I'm eager to finish this review so that I can stop thinking about that disgusting bowl. So that's all."
5,"Their rates are very reasonable, the staff is friendly and helpful, and on the extremely rare occasion that any issue arises, they take care of it promptly and beyond my satisfaction.  

I've never really had a bad experience with Enterprise, but this location in particular is just full of really nice people.  Fatima in particular is so sweet, remembers my name and where I live, and goes above and beyond to make me feel like a valued customer. 

It's really nice to feel like employees of anywhere recognize you as a good customer and treat you with mutual respect, kindness, and reward your loyalty. We all know that the squeaky wheel gets the oil, so it's nice to see positive karma reinforced at Enterprise. 

Once they called me to let me know I had left a burned cd in their disc player and offered to drop it off with me while they were out doing their pick-ups. WHO DOES THAT? These guys do. Because they are awesome.

 Another time, there was a bit of a wait (they were insanely busy just before a holiday weekend, but still smiling and keeping it cool, even though I could see the exhaustion in their eyes) because they were backed up on getting their cars cleaned on the inside before they could ok them for rent.
 I told them I didn't really care, had no one to impress, and they could give me a dirty car as long as there wasn't literally bodily fluids inside it. Save yourselves a few minutes on cleaning that, I'm probably going to put new trash and crumbs in it shortly anyway. 

They looked at me, and told me that they appreciated my sentiment and apologize for the wait, but they would feel bad about giving me a crumby car. So, tell you what. Lets just bump you up the list of cars and give you a free upgrade to a higher class of car, of which we already have one cleaned and ready.  I said that wasn't necessary, I wasn't in a rush.  They said they wanted me to have it, because I was so nice and a good customer besides. Well. I guess if you insist on a free upgrade... I'll take it. 

I like that the corporate Enterprise seems to value this sort of behavior in it's employees, and fosters a positive work environment. From talking to their reps, it seems like they work hard, but are fairly rewarded for work well done. And it shows. East Washington Enterprise is great.  And, of course, they pick you up. :)"
5,This is absolutely The best Thai restaurant anywhere!  I have had  these culinary  masterpieces since they first opened and can never get tired of all the  delicious  flavors  each dish has. From the  appetizers  ( Dragon Eggs) to the specialty dishes ( Pineapple Prawns) to the unbelievable desserts ( Lemon Ginger Cheasecake)  You  could NOT be disappointed ! Ola takes great pride in all her creations and  is usually always there  right along side  her gifted  team.  I could not end this review  without  giving  kudos to the talented wait staff  who are all  great but  I gotta give a special shout out to M & A  !
1,"Pizza is inconsistent. Sometimes under cooked, other times cut disturbingly wrong ( sad when half of it is for a vegetarian ). Forget ordering chicken wings! It's like pulling teeth!!!! How hard is it to get "" medium bone out ""? 4 out of 5 times it's anything but! Last night was the straw that broke camels back when we found out that this time they gave us honey BBQ. After calling the manager to let her know of the mistake, she replies ""I guess some one else got your wings"". Really!? An apology would have been more appreciated then a sarcastic comment! I don't recommend going to this Pizza Hut. The service is worse then the neighborhood it sits in. I wish there was a negative star I could rate this place."
5,Still my favorite Pad Thai in Arizona.  I normally just get pad thai from any thai place I visit but my friends got me to try the beef panang and it is really excellent.  I love this place.  The wait for your food can be long at lunch but its worth it.
5,"5 starts for being one of the few places I have ever been that has full on, decked out vegan breakfasts!  No wimpy smoothies or oatmeal here.  I'm talking tofu scramble and vegan hash.  I'm in love..."
1,"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!  If this is fine French dining in Phoenix then don't expect much. I should have read the Yelp reviews before we  decided to try the ""famous French Restaurant"", We had reservations at 8:00 and arrived a little late(8:10) . We were greeted and told to wait . Finally the hostess returned and took us to the dining room that had only a few tables in use. After sitting without menus, water bread or attention for some time we finally received service. The menu looked good with some French favorites and with some southwest flavor as anticipated. We ordered wine( good list) and later ordered foie gras and rack of lamb. We got our wine and a bread basket with ""famous croissants"". OUR FIRST MAJOR disappointment. The brown bread was warm but old and tough. The croissants were tiny, old, tough. (Pillsbury could have done better).
 The foie gras arrived with a nice presentation. When we had ordered we had asked if toast points would accompany the foie gras and the waitress said no that we had the bread basket. We asked if some sort of toasted bread could be brought(e.g. baguette). she said she would see if something was available.   The foie gras had four pieces of the brown bread that were burned. The foie gras was a normal piece of sauteed liver on a slice of pineapple. There was nothing about the dish that made you lick your lips(as we usually do with foie gras). The sauce was bland, the pineapple was not grilled, and for some reason they added a few sliced cherry tomatoes on the plate.
The rack of lamb arrived again with a nice presentation:  scalloped potatoes, green beans and peas, and cauliflower florets. Small quantities but reasonable. The lamb ribs had been sliced with au juice. The rack was miniature with small thin medallions, appropriately medium rare, but not a good quality lamb.The best item on the dish was the red pepper jelly on endive. 
We did not take a chance on dessert,  paid our bill and departed. We knew now why there so few customers on a Friday night.  We also asked about Vincent as we were leaving.(We thought he might have retired or sold). We were told that Vincent was in France. ( Maybe to get a refresher course on good French cooking)"
5,"Yum! Monty's was absolutely adorable. After eating dinner there I can say with certainty this will become one of my new regulars. Right when I walked in I knew it would be a place I would enjoy. The atmosphere was that of an older, trendy diner and had a quick moving, upbeat, friendly staff making the atmosphere even more enjoyable. My friend got the artichoke sandwich, delicious, and I got the chicken in a pie, right from grandma's kitchen. Afterwards we ordered a red velvet cupcake which was to die for, and all for under $15. We shared great conversation and didn't feel at all rushed, our waitress was great. She made recommendations and shared jokes with us, not seeming to put up a front at all. I will be going back sooner rather than later."
1,"The pizza was good at one time...... what happened? 
This is the saltiest stuff I ever ate.............did the chef change about 8 years ago....  and show up with nothing more than a salt shaker..... the only thing you taste is salt......... I know it is the sauce.... so everything must be this salty.........maybe that cookie is good..... Is that salty too?????
definitely pass on this one...... yuck......."
5,"Dr Brandon has been my optometrist for, I don't know, maybe 8 years or more, and he is always friendly, pleasant, professional and efficient.  He has lots new gadgets and fancy testing equipment, I always feel my eyes are in good hands there.  I have also bought my prescription glasses there many times, they are fairly expensive but you get what you pay for, I have never had a problem with glasses I bought from Brandon Eyes.  Great customer service too!  The staff and opticians are knowledgeable and competent as well as good natured and helpful!"
5,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! The ambiance was perfect and the company was even better. I only had a beer, but the staff made it an awesome experience. They were all very knowledgable and took the time to give us a background on the diner and what their thoughts and inspirations were for the Welcome Diner going forward. I am so excited to come back this weekend and try out some of the grub, because it looked and smelled amazing! If you are looking for a cool vibe, amazingly gracious staff and a chill place to have a beer (or 7), you should absolutely check this place out! Congrats guys, you are off to a great start!"
5,"Back again, back again. 

The time came to upgrade from my previous bike (a hybrid, a bike better suited for short distances, a bike too big for me, a used bike I bought for $50 and couldn't keep fixing up, a lovely friend, a loyal commuter) to a brand new road bike, built to fit me. 

I walked into the shop on a Saturday, sat down, and said, ""Build me a Surly!"" And Earl laughed. He has no problem with Surlys, he said, and he'd build me one if that's what I wanted. But he made me do some research first. And he asked me what I'd be using the bike for. Earl and I talked for about an hour that day, and I left the shop with a few of Earl's suggestions: bikes and companies I had never heard of or considered (Handsome Cycles, Soma, All-City, to name a few). 

I still wanted that Surly, though, so I went back. ""Build me a Surly!"" Earl said he would. But I'm short (barely five-foot-two), so Earl wanted to make sure I'd actually fit on a Surly before ordering one. He called a previous customer and asked her to bring in her Surly. He hooked the bike up to the trainer, watched me pedal, told me to shift, told me to break, told me to actually ride the bike, and I did. So, he ordered me the surly. 

The whole process - sitting down, ordering the bike (the Cross-Check), picking the color (wonderful lime green), selecting the seat and pedals and fenders and, and, and - took about twenty minutes. The building of the bike took exactly a week. And it's a beautiful bike. Sleek and clean and fast and light. Put together expertly. Adjusted at least three times (Can you raise the seat? Can you lower the seat? Can you pull the handlebars forward? Can you pull the seat forward?) the day I picked it up. Happily. 

It was a dream, building this bike with Revolution. Not once did I feel pressured by Earl or the rest of the crew at Revolution. Not once did I feel belittled, talked down to, or laughed at. Not once did I feel that my dream bike wasn't cool enough, worthy enough, or good enough to build. I had a bike in mind, and Earl told me to think about it. I thought about it, and Earl told me they could do it. And they did. Professionally, quickly, expertly. And I could not be happier with the bike I've got now. 

I'll come back again and again and again to these guys because they're just that good. For everything. Fixing up old bikes, like my Specialized, and building new ones. The best."
5,"Fantastic - so many things to see in the conservatory that you buy and eat without thinking about how they grow.  We went during November, but if I lived in Madison, I'd be here every week during the winter just to get a dose of the tropics.  Gorgeous grounds to stroll around, and a stunning array of plants."
5,"If you are looking for a great fishfry this is your place. My husband and I have been going to Toby's for 5 years. We have never had a bad meal. Everything is great. My husband loves the chicken and I haven't had better shrimp than the ones at Tobys and I grew up in Florida.
It's family owned and everyone in the family works there.
We are there at least twice a week.
There is quite a wait on Fridays but it is so worth it."
5,"Best donuts in the valley...hands down.

Let me start by saying that I have had a 30 year long obsession with donuts that has taken me around this country in search of the best donuts wherever I happen to be. 

Home is Phoenix and I drive 25 minutes out of the way to visit THIS Rainbow Donut shop.  The other is down the street... Good. Not the same. 

Whether you are into the perfectly fluffy raised and glazed or the old school cake donuts, you will not be disappointed. 

Croissants and other pastries are also fantastic and deserve a try. 

But the real masterpiece at Rainbow is their enormous (and standard priced) Buttermilk donut. It will fill you up like eating three regular donuts as I'm pretty sure they use a yeast based dough to make this little gift-from-donut-heaven. 

They claim to be the best donuts in the state, I can't validate that. But, I can tell you they are top 3 out of dozens of shops I've been to in a handful of states, dozens of cities."
1,"Absolutely horrible place! Snakes was treated like pieces of shit, and we WILL NOT stand for it! The manager is a complete asshole and doesnt give a shit if you have a good time or not, as long as he gets his money. Completely unprofessional and neither myself, or any of my friends will ever set foot in this hell hole of a place ever again."
5,"The best in Phoenix !!

SImply the Best BBQ anywhere!!!!!!"
1,"After being raided several times by Arpaio's posse, apparently Arpaio started hooking them up with tent city work furlough workers. 

I made a huge mistake of getting my oil changed there. Halfway into the change I asked them if they replace the oil filter (I shouldn't have assumed), he said no, but he JUST MIGHT have a matching oil filter that he could install for $30 bucks. What? He then tries to upsell me on an air filter, saying oil filter and air filter costs $150, but for me he'd do it for $100. I have no doubt in my mind this guy was going to try and pocket the cash.

Avoid this place like the plague."
5,"I tried a wine tasting a loved everything about the place; atmosphere, service, and wine and food were excellent. 

Highly recommend it!"
1,"Don't go here on a busy day, which is whenever the dbacks or suns play. You will be waiting forever for your food and it will be cold. Then when you complain they blame it on being busy and make you feel like an idiot. The owner sits drinking instead of helping out and basically tells customers to shut up and stop whining!

***Reply to ""owners"" comment****

Jason, 
Maybe you should get YOUR facts straight before posting a reply.  We waited for over 45 minutes for our COLD food to arrive, only after we asked the bartender where our food was.  Your manager walked over with our ticket and said "" I see you've been waiting for over 45 minutes for your food"" When we responded that we had never waited that long, she replied "" well we're busy and short-handed"" There was no upfront apology to the fact that our food was late, making us in turn late for the game.  Your bartender is not a pleasant person as she would ask what we wanted and not wait for the answer before turning and getting another customer a drink.  Unfortunately, we were seated behind one of the beer taps to begin the afternoon and seemed to be forgotten as we sat with empty glasses.  We did NOT demand to speak to the owner.  He had said hello about 20 min earlier and when the manager came over, my mom asked to speak to the owner.  She said he's not working today, and my mom replied,"" I just saw him"", your manager then said "" I'll go get the owner for you."" There was no demanding there.  Also please learn to read before posting replies as I stated the owner BASICALLY said to shut up and stop whining.  The way he spoke to us is the reason why we would never come back.  Also you posted in my mom's review that our food and drinks were comped.  We sent the food back as it was cold, so it wasn't comped, and we only had 3 beers between the two of us, the last two were just poured and left undranken.   Get your facts straight before coming on here and calling people LIARS.... Maybe if your bartender would have been a little more personable and offered an apology or something in the first place this whole situation would have been remedied."
5,"Good food for a good price...

I finally got to try out the New Orleans Take Out Restaurant and was fairly impressed. The wife and I split an order of etoufee and black beans and rice. It was plenty of food. Nothing too fancy, but it was tasty. I will definitely be going back and will hopefully try out a poboy and some of their other dishes. . 

For the people saying no place to sit. Are you sure you are rating the correct location? They had plenty of tables there complete with copies of the northside news paper, isthmus and the onion."
1,"The staff is so rude. Amy and Anissa are the most unprofessional managers I have ever come across. The food is too expensive, the environment is too stuffy and the staff is extremely rude."
5,"BEST.CREME.BRULEE.EVER!!

And the food, the piano bar, the service is ABSOLUTELY to die for.

Louisiannes is the kind of place that you can GENUINELY never go wrong.  It's in an underground cave, very ""Adams Family Values"" (Ok, isn't it bad that I compare it to a movie), their wine list is VERY extensive, and if you go at ~6ish, there's always the piano man, ready to delect you with a rendition of a bluesy jazzy tune...

While I think reservation is HIGHLY recommended (there's like 10 tables at MOST), it just so happens that everytime my husband and I go, we can get in.. Lucky us!!!

Seriously, by far one of the BEST restaurants in Madison (whoops Middleton)."
1,"Really crappy service, they could not have cared less about me or my injury, I would avoid these people."
1,"One of the lousiest lunches I've had in a long time. 

Caprese sandwich and breaded mushrooms with (curdled) ranch.

Sandwich seemed to come with strange rectangular processed mozzerela, and, aside from the strong purple onions, it was practically flavorless.

The breaded mushrooms were the skinniest shape and weirdest texture...seemed like I was biting into really dry fried cornmeal or something, there was no plump mushroom texture at all! Or taste! Were they real mushrooms? I don't know, I threw them out after one bite. The ranch dressing was curdled anyway (!!!), so they were beyond salvage.

Girl who took my order on the phone was (as others have mentioned) mumbly and careless, didn't even ask my name before ending the call. Chef/cashier was hard to talk to also, once he eventually came out, 5 minutes after I (one of two customers) arrived.

Weeeeeeeeeird place...baaaaaaaaaad food..."
5,"I first heard of C's from a review in 77 Square or some such thing and thought I'd try it.  I've NEVER had a bad dish there.  The bread for french toast is made in the restaurant - not pre-made and heated up, not store made bread, but real home made stuff.  The belguim waffles are fresh - not the frozen-then-heated-up kind.  Egg dishes are wonderful - lots of everything in the omelets, etc.  The staff is really friendly and service, yes, can be a bit slow, but they are ALWAYS hopping!  I give them a break because of that...  I took the bf there for the first time on a Badger football Saturday and now I can't go anywhere else!! : )  Portions are huge (often have a box to go) and as others have mentioned, the bakery is amazing : )  

Ya Gotta Try It!!"
1,If you choose to go with the mexican side of the menu its disgusting. Everything is slop on a plate. No one should come here and pay these prices.
5,"I've been to performances both on the Main-stage and the Little Theatre.
The acoustics are good, not a bad seat in either room.

Ticket pricing is very fair - especially compared to most other major cities.
There's also a great mix of events - at least two or three every season that I look forward to seeing. Also - one advantage both Phoenix Theatre and Gammage have over most venues in other cities (Or Herberger) is the abundance of free parking! 
Convenient to a Light Rail stop as well - almost like living in a ""real"" city!

Conveniently, I work second shift close to the Theatre - so weekday matinees fit into my schedule (and budget) perfectly.

Glad to have this venue - and glad to see how many people support it locally - not a lot of empty seats at any performance I've been to!"
5,"Recently rented speakers and microphones for an event and was very pleased with the service and quality. I emailed Full Compass, described my needs, and received a prompt response with a quote (within a couple hours). 

Easy pick up during regular business hours. I was showed how to use the equipment and it was loaded into my car. Equipment was easy to set up during our event and the sound quality was great! Quick and simple return. Will definitely use them again!"
5,Put it simple....Big warehouse for pets. Awsome deals. Huge selection. YOU HAVE GOT TO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT.
5,"After a big night during First Friday, tired and slightly hungover, I needed some comfort food.  Outside of the Five & Diner franchise, I hadn't been to anything resembling an authentic diner in the Phoenix area.  Ever.  So what a surprise to find an old diner transplanted from back east into the downtown Phoenix area.  It's a little on the fringes as the immediate neighborhood is a little sketchy, but we were going for a late breakfast on a Saturday so I didn't worry too much about my car.

The diner itself truly is a timewarp.  The interior is a simple 9 stool diner with a cooking area just as tiny.  You can't help but converse with the waitress and the cooking staff since they're basically right in front of your face.  If you're looking for more room (and want to keep an eye on your ride), there's picnic tables with umbrellas outside.

We got here around 11am so my girlfriend and I didn't feel too self conscious ordering drinks.  I got the mimosa while she got the bloody mary.  I'm not sure what they put in those drinks, but they had some kick!  They weren't overtly alcoholic, but just spicier than other mimosas or bloody marys I've had.  As for the food, I came here for one thing.  A biscuit sandwich.  More specifically, the Big Jim.  Fried chicken, country gravy, bacon, and cheddar on a homemade biscuit.  Unreal.  The biscuit was flaky, buttery heaven.  The batter on the fried chicken was delicious and the gravy wonderfully hearty.  Easily the best biscuit sandwich I've had in the Phoenix area.  My girlfriend got the Andouille Scramble which was basically an omelette with andouille sausage, peppers and onions with a side of potatoes.  She saw how much I loved my biscuit so she added a biscuit with honey to her order and was equally impressed.

We so wanted to save room for the beignets, but we were stuffed.  Total for the two drinks, two entrees, the add-on biscuit, and tip came to about $40.  Had we done non-alcoholic drinks it would've been a little under $30.  Their ingredients are locally sourced so you pay a little bit of a premium for that.  But considering the quality of the food and the unique experience, it was money well spent.  Whatever you do, find a way somehow to include a biscuit in your meal here."
5,"Speedy, friendly service, rarely messes up my order, even if it is complicated, which it usually is. 

Late night staff get swamped regularly, but handle it well. Great vegetarian and vegan options. 

(I feel I need to say that my five stars is versus other fast food restaurants, but for the money it definitely still holds its own. )"
1,Do you remember how Pancho's used to taste? Keep that memory and don't go again.
5,"Best expirence you'll ever have in a grocery store, yeah i said it,  someone give this place a low star review with a real profile photo. 


Five starts all the way for the ability to make a Market place a destination location.  People come from all over the valley to enjoy themselves and family to a food adventure. Clean, fun, great music, and a lot of people watching entertainment.   Personally I don't know what most the stuff is inside here but the smells and quality speak for its self.  Take a step out of the box and into Hispanic culture.

I recently ate at the restaurant inside it is definitely worth the try."
5,"I've gone to see games and ""Disney on Ice"" type of events at this stadium.

I've sat in some ""ok"" seats, VIP seating, and even got lucky and was treated to seats in one of the luxury boxes a couple of times.  Every seat I've had there was pretty good.

By admission, I am a Golden State Warriors fan, and as such I can't complain.  There are plenty of GSW fans in the audience at US Airways Center.  

The prices of tickets, parking, and food are much less expensive than other out-of-state venues I've been to.  The ease of parking and flow of traffic is light-years better than most major cities.

Also, there's a lot less ""crazies"" at this arena than other arenas.  I feel totally safe at US Airways Center."
5,"I think this is the most underrated lunch spot in central Phoenix.  Authentic  Philly food.  Can get busy at noon, but you can get it to go...."
1,"I was really looking forward to a great smoothie for lunch. At first, they said it was too watery and said they were going to remake it. As I watched, they poured it back in the mixer for a quick remix and then poured it into a cup. It was still watery and was probably the worst smoothie I have ever had!

So disappointed..."
5,"Beautiful course, we had a great day.  The Shrimp dinner was wonderful, very light breading.  Everyone is very friendly."
5,"Yellow Cab saved our early morning flight to the Bahamas for our wedding. Already being stressed out about the wedding, the last thing we needed was for Discount Cab to blow off our website made reservation (AND we talked to them on the phone to confirm). Discount chose not to call us when they ""couldn't find us"" and left for an new fare. While dicking around with them, I called Yellow Cab and the were there in 15 minutes. 

Driver was friendly and did a great job at sensing our eagerness to get to the airport (as now it is about 30 minutes later than our original pick up time with Discount!).  He didn't gripe about how many suitcases we had and was beyond courteous and polite.

We will call Yellow Cab again before we ever call Discount."
5,"Wow! The smell got me from the moment my dining partner and I entered. I could just tell things were ""right"" about this place. Then we saw the plates walk by..and the plates in front of the seated diners. I've paid a lot for smaller plates in the past. These plates could feed an army, and they are stacked with fresh cilantro, sprouts and frisee' beets. Truly a gorgeous spectacle of food.

We could not believe the cheap price, too...$9 for the pad thai. It was THE BEST pad Thai we've ever tasted, and we've had it all over the country. Because the place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon lunch rush we were seated at the bar and served right away.

I had the Thai iced coffee, served elegantly in a tall ice-filled glass. Strong and sweet. My dining partner had tea served in a French press. We had a soup starter (the broth was perfection), shared a plate of fresh spring rolls, which are the best I've had since I ate them for the first time in 1985 at Arc En Ciel in Garland, TX, because Wild Thaiger uses mint leaves--the only way to do them in my book. They were not only delicious, and were accompanied by an exquisite peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. Served two for $9.

The place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, with a few  cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out of necessity. The bar over looks an open kitchen where the owner/head chef prepares food next to assistant chefs. It is a show in itself.

Photos line the walls near the bathrooms and some of them are impressive--the head chef with some local celebrities and one with Steven Seagal. What were most impressive to us are the photos of their annual celebrations. Brightly costumed servers and performers...We want to know when these take place!

If you love Thai...GO THERE!"
5,"Went here for the wine tasting. Absolutely love this place.  The decor is upscale and the ambiance is quite and cozy.  Great place for a romantic dinner...hint hint for Valentines day. A reservation is a must for special occasion days. 
The wine tasting was sectioned off from the rest of the restaurant but the service was still exceptional. Got to sample 5 wines and a tapas for $15.  They offer their regular menu during the tasting also. I tried the fig and Brie bruschetta. A great sweet paring for the French wines. I also had a prosciutto and Gouda topped with onions and capers a great pairing for savory wines.  The table I sat with also had a ham and gruyere grilled sandwich which was fabulously amazing.  
The food was just as great as the service given by Stephano.  He was always there to fill the water glass, take an order for food, and just to make sure everyone was ok always with a pleasant smile and he kept great eye contact. One of the best servers I have encountered in a long time.    

Overall I would recommend this place for both fine dining and for their wine tastings which they do on a regular bases, approximately every 2 weeks. I also hear rumors that they also have a cheese tasting.  I can't wait to find out if its true."
1,"I went Honey Bear's with my wife to use a Groupon.  We like to try different places, not get stuck on one place and we were disappointed with Honey Bear's.

We got the pulled pork and BBQ chicken. The pork was dry with no smokey flavor. The chicken was drenched in sauce hiding the flavor. The sauce was too sweet for me as well, overpowering everything it's put on.

The sides of beans and corn were nothing  special as well. At the end. We were glad we tried them because it made us feel better about our favorite BBQ, Waldos in Mesa. 

We'll keep trying, but we believe no one will ever compare."
5,"My husband and I lovingly refer to Phoenix Ranch Market as Food City on Crack!  This place is amazing, but be prepared for a bit of culture shock as this is a truly authentic Mexican grocery store.  I have only walked the perimeter of the store, which is the bakery, fish market and carneceria. 

The bakery is phenomenal,  I would especially recommend the dulce de leche cake.  Next stop fish market, with an excellent seafood spread.  You can order food-to-go straight from the market, I recommend the shrimp ceviche.  Next stop the meat market - Wow!  Some interesting food you would not find at your local Albertson's.  Carne Asada (marinated) is an excellent and cheap choice to take home and have a mexican bbq in your very own backyard.  

The restaurant next door is also very good - great seafood enchiladas.  There are also soom little shops with items you would expect to find at a border town shop."
5,"This is definitely the place for Cajun. When you go in there I want you to expect a special of the day, homemade lemonade, and a everything made from scratch type feel. This isn't a place where you meet a hostess and they seat you. Just expect the best beans and rice outside of New Orleans."
1,"What a horrible horrible place.

I had  DUI and was looking for an assessment to get my license back and then later to take the required classes.  I had the option of going to several counseling centers but looked at going to TASC because it is near my work.  The amount of hours that they wanted me to have was reasonable but they wanted me to participate in their color systems, the same system drug offenders have to use for their probation.  I initially signed on to it but after realizing that I would have to call every single weekday and possibly come in to pee (regardless if I was across town or not) at a fee of $20 each time.  Wow.  What a scam.

So I called to tell them that I decided to use another facility that doesn't have such ridiculous rules and the counselor/head of TASC was screaming at me over the phone telling me that I was a dishonest abuser who just didn't want to take their UA tests.  I told her, you are right.  I don't want to call every day and pay you ungodly money because I DON""T HAVE TO.  I told her that furthermore, judging by her attitude and customer service skills I can see that the only customers that she will ever have are the ones that the courts FORCE to go to them

I really feel bad for those that have to go to TASC, The staff is rude and the whole thing is a scam.  They charge ungodly money for the tests and the system requires so many random tests that, in my opinion, it is set up for people to not be able to make it or fail.

If you have a choice, DO NOT go to TASC, they just want your money and they think you are nothing but a piece of shit.  Even their head counselors are used to screaming at and demeaning their customers.

I went to a different facility where they are professional and where they test every few months at their expense."
5,Just came back from the Pirate Exhibit!  Loved it!  I had purchased a bogo free ticket from Groupon a month or so ago so wanted to wait for the crowds to die down before going.  So glad I purchased those.  The exhibit is truly amazing!  I really lived out my childhood fantasy since seeing the Goonies when I turned around the corner and saw a pirate chest full of coins just sitting there.  My eyes lit up as if I were five.  So cool!  Right by that show stopper they had an exhibit display where you could actually touch the coins.  They had many artifacts from this lost sunken pirate ship on display and gave a great overall view of life for the pirates spread throughout.  A++
5,"The key here is to go in when they open their ovens baking some of their excellent pastries. I never leave without getting a freshly baked crossiant or churro. My wife introduced me to La tolteca and we have been making regular trips back ever since. We started out with breakfast burritos on weekend mornings and I have now fit it into my drive home from golfing for some tacos. Both of the aforementioned are excellent. 

It is really hard to find authentic homemade Mexican food and this place does it perfectly. I was convinced when I had my Mother-in-law's homemade rice and tacos that it was the best their was. I am not saying that Tolteca is better but it actually tastes close to the same. 

A little hint: Once it cools down a little bit, fall and winter months, they have a huge charcoal grill setup in the parking lot on weekends. You can get cooked whole chickens and full racks of ribs for around 8 bucks. They also cook fresh green chiles. A great alternative on game days when you don't have time to setup the grill before the game starts. Just run down and pick something up fresh off their grill!"
1,"Worst service. Two hours for a tire change them when nearly commpleat they take brake for 30 min.
 I'm the only customer waiting. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE
Lunch is more important"
5,"This place is great!  For starters, when you enter, its very colorful.  There was some spanish music playing overhead, and loads of things to look at.  They have a huge meat department, groceries, bakery and everything im between.

I wandered through the isles and liked what I saw.  I ended up eating a breakast burrito at thier food bar at the far end of there store.  I think this is a truely southwest expereince to come here, and I wish I had known about it when my friend Jason came out last October.  

They also have a lovely resturant attached to this place (as if the store itself won't do it for you) and that it authentic in itself."
1,"I can hardly believe how highly rated this restaurant/wine bar is. I have been twice and both times was treated to high prices, poor and condescending service and mediocre food.

Once I ordered a veggie plate specifically because the menu stated that it included haricot verts. When the plate came they were not on it. I questioned the server and she said they were ""out of season"", but had not bothered to tell me in advance that the menu item would not be as described. 

Against my better judgment I went back a second time with a wine tasting group. Some political thing was to take place in the restaurant hours later. It was being set up for so we were shunted to some tables we didn't want, service was abysmal and the food and wine were really overpriced for what we received. 

I will never go back."
1,"Ok, I am not one that knows her sushi well, but when I order a roll that said that is comes with crab, cream cheese, cucumber, and avocado, why am I getting a roll with just whitefish?

I have been here twice and each time I have had the worst service!  This time around was the most interesting.  Twice, bussers came to our table and just tried to take our chairs.  Did they ask? NO.  Did they notice that my friend's purse was on one of them?  NO.  Did they ever come back when we said that we actually needed one more chair? NO.  

Also, when it was time to pay the bill...all of us (6 people total) decided to make the server's job easier by writing on the back of the check on how much each of us was going to pay.  My one friend wrote $40 and I wrote $15 (I didn't eat much and I didn't get anything to drink)  This was with tip included.  Server comes back and charges my friend $15 and me $21.98.  (HUH!)  Then she told us that she couldn't add the tip with it.  Couldn't she have told us that first?  Especially when a sharp person could see that we were giving her way more than what the bill stated.

The food both times I was there was bleh.  Even the temperature of the food wasn't right.  I kept on thinking to myself this is how one gets food poisoned.  (I did not)  They turned off the heaters outside when there were still a bunch of people enjoying happy hour.  (It wasn't very warm out there!)  

Next time...we are going to meet somewhere in Tempe for sushi happy hour."
5,"Etiquette Question:  When waiting to get your new engagement ring sized down to fit your ring finger, what is worse?  A) Wearing the ring on the wrong finger so it doesn't fall off OR B) Not wearing it at all.  I say not wearing it at all, especially if your ring is as perfectly gorgeous as mine is.  I couldn't leave it in the sad little box all alone at home.

I took my new ring into a few stores to get quotes on the sizing and all of the places said I would have to leave it over the weekend because that is when the jeweler was working.  What a bummer!  The weekend is when I want to show everyone my new ring and announce my engagement.  It didn't seem like much fun to do one without the other.

Then, on a Wednesday afternoon, I decided it wouldn't hurt to check with the jewelry store across the street from my office, Renaissance Fine Jewelry.  I had a few watch batteries replaced there a while back and was very happy with the quality and speed of the service.

After showing the jeweler my ring, he was the first (and only) one to point out a few things about the ring that would cause challenges with the re-sizing process.  I was impressed.  Then he said he could I would most likely be able to pick up the ring on Friday.  That was music to my ears; I would have it for the weekend!!!

How could he do this so quickly when the other places wanted to keep my ring for 5-6 days?  I'll tell you why.  He is the guy; he IS the jeweler!  It is so nice to know that you are talking to the person who is actually doing the work!

The best part was I didn't even have to wait until Friday!!  My ring was ready for pick up less than 24 hours later!  Fantastic!  Yes, his price was a little higher than the other places, however for the upfront identification/notification of the challenges, the friendly service, and the speedy turnaround, it was worth every dime!

Now if I only had more jewelry to take to Renaissance . . .  =)"
1,"La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately, it can't be all of them.

I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.

I'll certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos."
5,"After having had some underwhelming meals at our hotel and around the convention district, this place was a BIG treat. The service was spot on, and we knew the meal was going to be good as soon as they brought out their special mixed chips and dark, smoky salsa. After our margaritas appeared (their special margaritas come out with a refill in the shaker), our entrees did not disappoint. Hearty chicken in the enchiladas and quesadilla, and our friend's intriguing 'naked' chili relleno. Portions were beyond generous, and thanks to checking in with Yelp we shared a dessert for free. We chose the banana burrito and had no regrets. Highly recommended. Sad that I won't be back in Phoenix any time soon - I'd definitely come back if this were in my city!!"
5,"The best service you will ever receive at any doctors office, hospital, or clinic in town. If you need Cardio services this is where you should go."
1,"The ahwatukee branch used to have 2 ATM's.
they now have one and this morning it as OUT OF SERVICE,!,,!,!
ONE TOP OF THAT THEY NOW CHAEGE 5$ for EACH OVERDRAFT TRANSACTION.

wells fargo is starting to look better and better."
1,"I usually won't give a one-star review, but in extreme cases. I was horrifically disappointed with the food and the service. We were there on New Year's Eve, which should be a night in which they are on their A-game, but I guess they don't find that important. I ordered a steak, cooked medium. When I got the steak, it was cooked well done. It is very sad when a restaurant can't cook a steak. Then the service was disappointing as we hardly saw our waitress. I surely hope there is a new chef since I was there, because I think he worked at McDonald's before there."
1,"They need to change the oil, fries both regular and greek came out brown and well done. Everything was bland. Greek salad tasted like nothing.  Calamari fried in old oil as well. Gyro sandwich was bland too. Beer selection limited. I'm not sure how this place is still running? Service was outstanding but we will never go back."
5,"I have been to the Wild Thaiger several times and I decided I should write a review because it is such a great restaurant. I went for lunch this time and the service was great. Although it was slightly loud, the food more than made up for it. Started out with lettuce wraps and ended with pad Thai. It was amazing! Very tasty :)"
1,"I unfortunately had the same experience as the other reviewer, I bought flowers for my wife and they died within a day or two.  Scary how similar my experience with the staff was.  They were rather rude regarding their poor flower selection and life of their flowers.  I definitely will not do business with them again.  Thomas H and Aurora E posted on the same day right after the ""owners"" response using very similar language and typing skills; i.e. using caps for a number of words and the poor grammar is the same.  That is a little suspect but I know it happens on yelp.  It's rather sad this company has to stoop to such low levels.  You would think they would just apologize and want to offer good customer service instead of quoting policy over and over.  In the ""owners"" 357 word response, not a single ""sorry"" or ""we will do better"" or ""we will make it right"" comment.  Nothing but a long winded explanation about what their policy is and why they are like Macy's (ironic that Macy's actually has amazing customer service and would probably be upset knowing this flower shop is comparing their lack of customer service to Macy's).  I think that is very telling about the owner's and staff at this shop.

I love supporting local business, but not ones that act like you should be thankful for doing business with them, it should be the other way around."
5,"This place has the best street tacos in Central Phoenix. I generally come here for lunch and order the tacos but they have lots of other great stuff. They also have a store here where you can get soda, beer, snacks, etc. They have a really good bakery here also. They do all their grilling over wood and the food has that great flavor. I sometimes get chicken and ribs to go from here and it is always really good. This place has been in Phoenix a very long time, I know I have been coming here for over 15 years and I will keep going back!"
5,"Hands down BEST pinatas I've found in the valley. 

A few years ago my favorite pinata store went out of business and I haven't been able to find a replacement up until recently. I throw lots of parties and love having a pinata for any occasion. When I'm looking for a pinata I usually visit multiple stores looking for something specific. What I find is the same old thing and more often than not- covered in dust. 

When I first walked into Pico Rico I was so please with the selection. Every row I went down I saw something new. There were plenty of varieties so even if it's not for a kids birthday party you'll find something great. Whenever I go back they always have new pinatas I hadn't seen before and something special for whatever holiday is near. The Christmas pinata I bought there was beautiful and unique, I got compliments on it. Their pinatas are very well made. I stuff them with at least 15 lbs. of goodies and they always hold up. On cheaper pinatas the wire will come out when there's too much weight inside. 

Other than pinatas they also have a huge selection of Mexican candy, some decorations and balloons. The staff is friendly and helpful. Even though this store is bright fuchsia it's still hard to miss so keep your eyes peeled when driving by."
5,Pooley's has partnered with a new restaurant and the food is AMAZING! I was skeptical to return there after a bad experience with the old restaurant owner and the food has improved 150%... I will definitely be going back for nachos and the Italian beef and enjoy myself a Capitol Seasonal!
5,"C's is a FANTASTIC place for breakfast. Family owned, this restaurant makes all the breads, buns, pies, and bakery in house. I had the eggs benedict and was pleased to be given a choice of ham or turkey, but of course I had to try the more traditional ham. I also made my hashbrowns ""C's hashbrowns"" by adding cheddar cheese and onions. The eggs benedict was delicious, the hollandaise sauce was also homemade and was the best I have ever had and the freshly thick shredded hashbrowns were very tasty and not greasy! C's was busy on this Sunday morning, but the service was quick, friendly, and delightful. C's has quickly become a favorite for Sunday breakfast."
5,"I thought I had a problem with my car's heater.  I took it into Virginia Auto and they discovered that was only a symptom of a major engine problem.  So they did some research on it and found out it was a manufacturer's defect.  They arranged for the dealership to get me a whole new engine, for free! There was nothing in it for them, but they took care of all the details to get this done. Tim got it all arranged for me and explained everything as he always does.  I love these guys, they are smart, friendly and fair!"
5,"I've been back here several times since my first review, and have been continually impressed with Prairie. The food is always spot on and the atmosphere is so comfortable. The cafe sandwiches take one step towards gourmet--the tuna and egg salads are made in-house with a little twist from the same old. All are served with a choice of side; I favor the black bean and corn salad. Breakfast is no exception to Prairie's perfection--my scrambled eggs with spinach and pesto were fresh and filling. And it's hard to go wrong with any of the real fruit smoothies or coffee drinks. Prairie is exactly the way a cafe should be."
1,Absolutely horrible. Don't bother coming here. We came because its and Taco Bell and a Pizza Hut so everyone could get something they liked. We waited 20 minutes just for the tacos and 35 minutes for 3 pan pizzas. The staff was unapologetic and every single one of them gave us attitudes. The assistant manager did apologize to us but she should probably get rid of the whole staff there especially the young black girl who had the absolute worst attitude out of all of them. Don't go here. There's plenty of other places to go around here.
1,I just order a collar for my dog. They have a great site which is easy to navigate. I checked the receipt and noticed not only a shipping charge of almost $9 but there was a handling charge of $7 on top of that. I called customer service and they explained that the handling charge is place on purchases under $60 and that covers the trouble to pick the smaller orders and cover the cost of the packing materials. I then said that I didnt realize that you use more shipping suppplies on a small order (collar) and I didnt realize that it was more troucle to pick a small order since they only said that they charge a handling charge on small orders under $60. You decide for yourself........................ Yes its my fault for not checking this prior to hitting confirm button!
1,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I'm Chinese and I know my rice.

So after a meeting next door @ Hava Jave (review for that place to follow) a friend and I wandered over to Zen32 for a 10pm snack.

Boy was that a mistake.  I normally eat up at Celsius in Desert Ridge so I thought I'd get the same food down here to compare.  

A couple of the rolls we ordered:

Viva Vegas Roll
Caterpillar Roll

The service was just fine but honestly, even if I had Angelina Jolie serving the food naked, the food would still be crap and the rating would still be an UNO star.

The rice seemed like it was day-old rice.  It was clumpy and honestly, I don't know how a sushi chef  takes CLUMPY rice and puts it into a roll...  so anyway, due to the clumpiness of the rice, the Vegas roll was loosly rolled so it fell apart when I tried to pick it up.

The Caterpillar roll tasted super bland which is VERY hard to do because it includes so many different ingredients like eel, faux crab, avocado, cucumber, and eel sauce.  Not only did it taste bland, it was also poorly rolled.  

Again, the service was nice but you might want to bring your own sushi if you're going to eat here..."
1,"I can't conjure up a worthy adjective to  the degree of disappointment I experienced at this restaurant. We were drawn in by reviews telling of some of Phoenix's ""finest Italian dining"", and were excited at the possibility of a new discovery.

Whomever reviewed this restaurant and gave it more than a ""yuck"" must have it confused with someplace else; the setting was dark and gloomy, the service  appalling, and the food would probably have been better if they had gone to Safeway's deli counter and reheated it in the microwave. 

We feel obliged to warn people about this terrible place.  Do yourselves a favor, and go elsewhere."
5,Awesome atmosphere for D-backs game. A must do once a year.
5,"The first time I came to 007 I walked in, sat right down and had an awesome spa pedicure at a really reasonable price! The gal who has done my spa pedicure twice now was very sweet and spent a lot of time on the foot/calf massage portion of the pedi. I was in heaven! 

My only gripe here has nothing to do with the staff, but the customers! Both times I've been in I've witnessed at least 3 other women treating the staff like dirt-- speaking to them rudely and criticizing them and their practices, speaking loudly on the phone during their service, etc. BE NICE. Just because English isn't someone's first language doesn't mean they don't understand. 

The staff is kind and accommodating and my toes look great. This is my monthly treat to myself!"
5,We stopped here after visiting Cosanti and the food is really good.  I had the carnitas tostada and it was loaded down with tender meat.  The salsa and chips were great and I ordered the agua fresca in tamarindo and it was delicious.  The regular size agua fresca is HUGE!  Great spot for Mexican if you are in town.
1,"Dear Karim, 

I was sooo excited to find your place. My BFF's favorite dessert is cobbler and she loves the whole soul food vibe, so for her Christmas present it was decided i would treat her to lunch at your restaurant. We planned this before Christmas and your website stated that you were open 11am-2pm and that worked perfectly for us. So on Sunday Jan 3rd we arrived at your place at 1:15pm, appetite in tow, craving what you had to offer and you know what ? You were closed??? No freakin explanation.. nothing! Your sign even had the audacity to say open ""11am - ??"" Really? WTF kind of crap is that? If you're going to be so casual about your signage, why don't you update your website to mirror your lax hours of operation. You completely ruined the day and her Christmas present which we were both looking forward to. We ended up going to Hard Rock, satisfied yet still disappointed by the day's events."
1,"Man what a mess! I found myself walking in circles trying to figure out where to start and where to end. Everything is out of order and the placement of new releases (movies and music) makes absolutely no sense. This store could use a training day in merchandising. The staff seem disengaged and not familiar with the product. Want to throw the staff for a loop, ask for a copy of LA VIE EN ROSE...had to repeat the title several times to two different people who could not figure out what I was asking for. Oh forget it! 
Sincerely,  Empty Handed"
1,"What a joke. We recently moved to this area of Phoenix and thought we would try it one night after seeing the sign that it was on the food network walking out of Sprout's. They charge $3 for bread and it is four small slices of stale french bread. The two pasta dishes had no real sauce or flavor and the prices are ridiculous. 

It was $32 for two pasta dishes and bread. I am so angry right now that I didn't go with my gut feeling and just go to Mamma Mia's. Mamma Mia is similar in price but offers twice the portion and you get the bread for free like a normal Italian Diner. I think this might be the angriest I have ever been after eating dinner out."
1,"This McDonalds is terrible 
They want to nickel and dime u for everything now they are even trying to charge for expresso in  their Ice Mochas which should come with a set amount as they always did 
Management sucks they always screw up at this location 
We will not return which is unfortunate because its right around the corner from where we work and are regular customers"
5,"Bar Bianco shows how fresh ingredients make all the difference. I never mind waiting for the excellent pizza served next door, at Pizzeria Bianco, because it is always a treat to order some appetizers here. I love the cheese platter because not only are both the cheese and bread excellent, but the additions like raisins and nuts are delicious too. 

Even though you may think that you need to go into Pizzeria Bianco with an empty stomach so you can have as much pizza as possible, it would be a mistake to not try some of the amazingly fresh and tasty things off the Bar Bianco menu."
5,"These guys are AMAZING! I brought my car in and they checked over the WHOLE car! I realize my car needs some TLC. The guys prioritized my list of things I need to get done and made me estimates too. I know I have alot of money I need to save to fix my car but the guys are helping me out and we are doing a little at a time. I LOVE the fact they told me EVERYTHING that was wrong with my car. They have a GREAT staff, a WONDERFUL warranty (2 years/24,000 miles on Parts & Labor), AMAZING technicians, and an attitude of service. I feel at home and will NEVER take my car someplace else, EVEN just for an oil change!!!"
1,"Oh shit!  Literally.  

I was at this location on Sunday night (2/25/07) and it was horrible.  The first thing we noticed was that there weren't any dishes.  It was like nothing new was being washed and brought out for customers to use.  Then the place started to smell bad... and then we noticed the waste water bubbling up from the floor drains behind the salad bar.  It was like something out of a horror movie.  We left in a hurry... a drainage grate in the parking lot was flowing with more raw sewage.  It was amazingly gross.  

Any good experiences I've ever had in this place are moot... I'm never going back to this location again."
1,"Based on my experience with this florist, I'm avoiding them in the future and would certainly advise others to do the same. 

I placed an order on Oct. 31 to be delivered on Nov. 1 (to a location less than half a mile away). The flowers weren't delivered, I wasn't contacted that they weren't delivered and there was no note on the door to indicate a delivery was attempted.

I called to inquire why and while they were somewhat apologetic, they made no attempt to compensate me for their failure to deliver or inform me of such. No waved delivery fee, no half-off next arrangement, nothing like that. I told them I thought this was poor customer service and that they'd lost a customer, only to receive a sarcastic ""I'm VERY sorry we've lost your business"" in reply. 

Find a better florist, they're out there."
5,BEST Thai food! They must teleport the food from Thailand because the meals here are amazing. The yellow curry chicken and pad Thai are full flavored meals needing no condiments added. The service is great but get there before the lunch rush as this place is full by noon.
1,"we ordered three entrees for delivery. it took about forty five minutes and then the delivery guy proceeded to argue with my boyfriend over how much he should tip him. after finally handing over the greasy box with our food in it, we were disgusted to see some form of batter and seeds that should have been my sesame chicken. it was ominously labeled ""HCl."" the food was disgusting and I can't believe how rude the delivery guy was. we paid 35 dollars for nothing but disappointment. buyer beware. we certainly won't be back here."
5,"This place was wonderful all around. I would return and I would recommend. It is a bit higher price point, but it is such a great space it is worth it. If you are looking to get away, relax, have a romantic weekend, enjoy nature, this is a great place. If you just need a place to sleep you might want something less expensive (unless you can afford it). 

The first floor of the house is very clean and neat, but has a very comfortable and cozy feel. There is a small kitchenette stocked with coffee, tea, cold drinks and lite snacks. If we stayed longer I could see relaxing down there enjoying a glass of wine, playing a game or reading. There is a nice selection of wine available to purchase so you don't even have to go out. 

Our room was very nice. King sized bed, robes, our own deck with a great view of the sheep. The bathroom had a big Jacuzzi tub and a large duel-head shower. We enjoyed glasses of champagne on the deck before heading out to explore and hike around their land. 

He had dinner downtown Madison which was an easy drive to and from. When we returned we were happy to have the fireplace in our room and cozied up with some of freshly baked cookies left out for guests. 

Breakfast was delicious. Farm fresh eggs from their hen's, herbs from the garden and all the other ingredients were local. We had good conversation with the other couple staying there as well as the owners.

Great place!"
5,Very friendly. The owners are very nice and the food was wonderful.
1,"mmmm....eerrrr... this is not real barbeque.  The ribs don't taste bad, but they aren't cooked slow enough, because the meat doesn't fall off the bone and all the flavor comes from the sauce that's slathered on it, not the actual meat.  The turkey was a insult to the art of barbecuing -- it tasted like deli meat that had been sprayed with liquid smoke."
5,"For years I've been stopping here when in the area.  They are the nicest people and the food is awesome. 

Stopped by yesterday for a quick bite after not having lunch. I was on the phone in the lot for a bit and went in at 645. I didn't even realize they close at 630 but the staff person was still serving customers and pleasant as always. The Panko Chicken is my favorite but I have had many other things also. The Panko was freshly made and my order very quickly filled.

I recommend this place to anyone hungry for fresh Asian fare!"
5,"This subway is one of the cleanest, and most efficient subways I have EVER been to.  I've only been in the evenings, but I have to say every time I walk in, someone is always cleaning something.  Their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins.  Sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck. Thats what makes this Subway so great. Everything is in it's place, and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work.  Absolutely I will go here again, and I can't say that about many Subways unfortunately."
5,"The Heard Museum is amazing.  

I've only been here once, during one of their free attendance days.    Although there are some kid-oriented exhibits, teens and adults will get the most out of this museum.

The Kachina exhibit is wonderful.  All of the art is breath-taking.  The Indian school exhibit is heart-breaking.

I highly recommend going to this museum at least once, especially if you live in AZ."
1,"This place is a joke.  The girls that were handling the cover wouldn't give me my money back from being in that place for only 1 min...   They weren't apologetic at all... On top of that, no one was in there."
5,"This is my husband's and my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant. You have to like spicy salsa though because they only have spicy green and spicy red salsa. Both are good if you can stand the heat! The chips are good: thin and hot (although you might have a few greasy ones at the bottom of the basket). I've never had better green corn tamales or refried beans than I can get here. My husband likes the egg burro with green sauce all over it. Yum, yum, yum!!!"
1,"My husband wanted to surprise me with flowers while I am home on maternity leave, he gave instruction not to ring the door bell, just in case our baby was sleeping..The man who delivered the flowers actually scared the h*ll out of me! I was nursing my baby, therefore could not come to the door and he stood there ringing and knocking on the door for 10 minutes while my dogs were going crazy. I was actually terrified to answer..I had to stop my baby from eating to see who this psycho was...when I finally figured it out after calling my husband
..the guy was getting in his car.. as I was opening the door HE had the nerve to roll his eyes and act in annoyance! maybe this company needs to figure out a more beneficial delivery strategy or don't hire psychotic drivers. ..Although HE was ""successful"" in making his delivery..I will never recommend this company to delivery. .stick to in store pick up...nice flowers and a fussy baby..thanks a lot"
1,"Several friends and I came here during Arizona Restaurant week, we made reservations, arrived on time and planned on having a good time. The place was half-empty and we didn't get service for water for atleast 10 minutes. We wanted to order a bottle of wine, but they ran out of the one we wanted...it was only 6pm. The waitress had a really hard time recommending another, and the one she said was similar was rather icky. (Nothing like the wine we wanted that we've had before). We weren't able to order for atleast another 30minutes and weren't served our first course for 30 minutes after that. We didn't start to eat until we had been there for an hour at minimum. In addition, the blackberry creme brulee also suddenly became ""out of stock,"" and we had to choose something else. This was all during one of the best promotional weeks for this restaurant. I would never come back here. Ever."
1,"Old equipment that is usually broken. There is ALWAYS at least one broken machine, usually cardio. The place is very dirty and smelly. The AC never seems to be working. The front desk staff are usually to busy being on their cell phones or talking to other staff to acknowledge you.  I'm considering driving to 43 ave and bell. That is a nice one!"
5,"I had a wonderful experience at the Welcome Diner and can't wait to go back. First and foremost, I love the fact they support all local! Stimulating the local Phoenix economy is so important and I really commend them for being an excellent example of this. When I walked in I was impressed at how cute and comfortable the indoor and outdoor setup was. Super cute bar and cozy outdoor seating as well. True to their name, it made me feel very welcome. The food was excellent and really appreciated the gluten free options. I highly recommend eating here if you are looking for a fun, friendly, relaxed atmosphere and well priced delish food!"
5,"This is a place not to miss! We have been to all the Mexican spots in the Valley (Los Dos Molinos, TeePee, Nando's, Ajo Al's,) and this is our new favorite!

We decided to give this place a try after a few years of living here and had a great authentic experience. The huevos rancheros were amazing and my husband had the chicken tacos- which were fantastic!

Don't be scared away by what part of town it's in- it adds to the experience! Be sure to get a pastry to go, the bakery is amazing!"
5,"Came here after a company christmas party with a few co-workers. Service is great, happy hour pricing is right on point.   

Carmella (Sorry If I'm spelling your name wrong) is an amazing, friendly, knowledgable server. 

Huge out door patio. Great fun. I'll be back again."
1,"When we moved here last year things went down hill from the start. After excepting our keys we immediately saw a roach. They had the bug guy come out. That was months ago and we've had him out a few more times and STILL more roaches! There is NO hot water. I've called to have it fixed, they came and it's still not fixed. Our garbage bins overflow and half the time someone is parked in my spot. Their parking is funky too. They have our spot COMPLETELY on the opposite side of the complex. I DO NOT recommend this place and we will be leaving as soon as the lease is up."
5,"This is just a standard TGI fridays rebranded for the baseball park.  That being said, we no longer have TGI fridays in Hawaii, so the food was a new experience for me.  I went on a Monday at noon, so as expected, there was not many people.  We were able to sit by the windows that overlook the park, which was breathtaking to me.  (Dont have a professional baseball stadium in Hawaii either) 

So, in terms of the food, my Auntie and Grandparents got the endless lunch.  Around $7-8 I think.  It came with Unlimited Breadsticks, soup and salad.  Only bad thing is that the French Onion is a one-order soup, and not unlimited without a small charge.  Thats bad because I absolutely LOVE french onion soup.  But my Grandparents and Auntie loved their food.  

I had the Korean Beef tacos.  Love it.  Good flavor, and rather large portion.  (TIP from my Auntie, ask for potsticker sauce on the side and pour it on the rice and/or tacos) 

The customer service was great, our waitress was super friendly and conversational.  Since it was pretty much empty, we walked outside to look at the stadium from the balcony they have.  While we did that, another employee got confused and cleared away our drinks and utensils.  Our waitress noticed before we came back and replaced it all.  She also took our picture outside for us.  Shame I dont remember her name to give her recognition on here. 

Overall, 

Food- 9/10
Price: 7.5/10
Location- 10/10
Customer Service: 20/10

The food and everything else was great, but it was the waitresses customer service that absolutely put it over the top."
5,"Usually renting a car is pretty straightforward, but Fatima went out of her way here to make it a great experience. She was friendly, personable, and knowledgeable. She was able to accommodate my request for a specific car. The car was clean and drove great. Renting it and returning it were quick processes and I left happy."
5,"Five stars for my fire-roasted veggie tacos.

Zero stars for the heat. My god, Arizona is Satan country."
1,Spent 1k last week on tires for 2 cars at F&F Stoughton rd. Set up a 1 pm appt for both cars to have tires installed today.  When we scheduled the appointment we were told it would take an hour. Now being told it will be 4pm before they are done because they forgot about our vehicles.  beware folks. This is not service.
5,"I have only eaten here physically at the location once. BUT I order catering for my office about once a week from this location. The couple that own the business are hard working nice folks, they always take my order via phone and are nice and responsive.

They are almost always a little (to a lot) early to deliver my sandwiches, but always include forks, places, lots of napkins, pickles and sauce. The coworkers that eat the sandwiches are always pleased with the product and I don't have anything but good things to say."
1,"Stopped in for a Bloody Mary on Sunday because Hazelwood's and Zipps were jam-packed. The neon sign on the place says ""Darwin's"" but apparently is known as ""Famous Wings.""

Here's a ""joke"" from the bartender:

""What's the worse thing about being a Packers fan?

Telling your dad you're gay.""

Bash Packers' fans all you want, but ""gay"" is not a synonym for ""stupid.""

Food was sampled and left mostly uneaten. Skip it!"
5,"It was awesome. I was just passing through Phoenix and found this place on Yelp, I would suggest you go."
5,Everything I have ever tried here is delicious! The cupcakes are to die for!
5,"Places like this are the highlight of living in Arizona. Good access to cheap, delicious and authentic Sonoran food. I tried Chilaquiles here for the first time and they were amazing!! The horchata was pretty run of the mill but the empanadas were fantastic! 

I also really like the market they have. A really great place to have in the neighborhood."
5,"I love this place! I'm half salvadorian and grew up eating many of the meals on the menu. Coming here makes me feel nostalgic. And everything is so delicious! It's always worth the trip coming from Ahwatukee. I've tried many pupusas throughout Phoenix, Tempe, and Mesa... El Guanaquito tops them all. The owner is a humble, timid yet very friendly man, as well as the entire staff."
5,"I saw the promotions for the Clean Diesel event in April; I went in to the dealership about mid-afternoon on a Saturday to inquire about more information.  Tim Regan was my Sales & Leasing Consultant; he asked me about my driving habits and needs and then gave me suggestions on what the best car to fit me would be.  During the test drive, Tim was friendly, personable and gave me information about the car, the company and himself personally. 

I decided to purchase a 2014 Jetta. Tim knew I was in the middle of hellish week as busy season was wrapping up at work.  He was patient with my lack of free time and worked around my schedule to get paperwork signed.  I took the car home that night.  The next day, Tim, came to my work place (bringing me my favorite Starbucks drink!) to pick up the car and take it back to the dealership for cleaning and detailing.

When Tim brought back my shiny, clean car, he spent a hour with me, walking me through all the features, explaining the little details and answering all my questions.  I was so comfortable with him and even happier with my purchase.

I have now had the car a week and I could not be happier with the car and and my positive Zimbrick experience."
5,"Driving back from Wisconsin Dells to Illinois hungover and following a strict vegetarian diet, can be a little tricky. I hadn't been to Madison in a few years, so we decided to try a place in Madison (I also figured that they would be more likely  to have restaurants that cater to my needs). My boyfriend did some yelping, and shortly we were on our way to Monty's. There is a private lot which is always nice when you're in a busy city. We did not sit outside because it was a little chilly but the patio looked pleasant and relaxing with beautiful flowers. When you go inside the ambience is a funky little 50's diner with amazing looking pies. Even though the restaurant was crowded, we were able to get a table fairly quickly. As I opened up the menu, I almost died but before that I even thought of moving to Madison right away! There are so many vegetarian, vegan, gluten free options that it is the majority of the menu, which is so rare to find at a breakfast diner. We both ordered the sweet potato hash and it was to die for! Just what we needed that day! I wish there was another one in Illinois. My only suggestion is to serve the fruit on a separate plate instead of piling it all on one big plate, that makes the food messy and crowded."
5,If they accepted credit cards this here folks would trump Disneyland as the happiest friggin place on earth. Edit: If they accepted credit cards and let you take pictures with Belle this here folks would trump Disneyland as the happiest friggin place on earth.
5,Just a few blocks from Chase field & US airway arena. Great beer selections and specials. I recommend the chicken wings.
5,"I love love love Ryan's.  It is my favorite place ever and you can get SOO much stuff there for a whole lot cheaper than anywhere else.  They do have a minimum order of $25, but obviously when you are in Toys r us for dogs, you can accomplish that in no time!!"
1,One star for the massive headache I got after I ate the food... MSG?  Not sure.
1,"After repeatedly trying to contact Pam following her response I received no effort of a reply. Both times I spoke to Donna and either she did not pass on my message or Pam choose to not respond. Either way, my previous post seems to be justified. Following frequent incorrect pieces of information provided from the staff (and some outright lies) I have no choice but say STAY AWAY FROM ARCADIA COVE!! 

The costs are going up and the staff is becoming more impossible to work with, Specifically Donna who feels no need to follow through on anything her staff says to the residents. Obviously Pam is not regularly available for anything other than writing phony concerns on Yelp. 

Recent increased fees and changes in policies without proper notice (dating notifications up to 2 weeks prior to actually delivering them) are out of control and somehow legal through manipulations of information provided in the lease. 

This property has become and absolute disaster. I recommend looking anywhere that is NOT ASSOCIATED WITH MEB!!!

Also - DO NOT read their website reviews - they only put up reviews that recommend the complex and completely disregard all others."
5,Lots of fun stuff. Planitarium really neat. Great learning and hands on for kids and the kids at heart.
1,"This is a very mixed review for me.   I had a great experience shopping at Sleep America, the salesman was low pressure and quite friendly.  I made a mattress selection and after the 30 days, I still hadn't had a full nights sleep.  Thankfully, they offer a sleep guarantee and I was able to take the sleepless mattress back and go back to Tempurpedic. I now rest easily on my king size piece of heaven.  
Why only one star???  I used their 0% financing for 24 months option, in which Sleep America has an arrangement with CitiFinancial services.  I can only say this, if you're not paying cash or using your own credit, STAY AWAY!!! CitiFinancial Services will not send you contract documents and say that you got them, the will hit you with fees and late fees, even when you pay on THEIR website before it's due.   And when you call to dispute it, you get someone from a foreign country who doesn't have a firm grasp of the English language, therefore, they don't understand that if you make a payment BEFORE your due date, that it is not late.  
I'm going to pay this off right now and be done with CitiFinancial for good.  At least I'll be able to sleep good at night knowing I did the right thing and that I got a great mattress for a fair price."
5,"Rostias Place is the best Mexican food place in Phoenix.  They have amazing machaca and the salsa's are always great.  Sometime's the salsa's and chile are so hot I fear my stomach might explode, but in a good way. It doesn't get any better than Rosita's."
1,"Ug, never had been, never will go again.  It's a sad thing when Taco Bell is better than something."
5,"""Forrest, what's going on with them damn sugar fried biscuits!"" Yes, that is what I literally heard there. This was followed by a refund on some of our meal-more on that later.

My friend is a UW student and after deciding to visit him he took us here to eat. We ordered the brisket, rib and chicken. The brisket was cut, almost chipped with a tangy/sweet sauce with a little bit of a bite at the end and little bits of onions that were chewy/crunchy. I asked the person taking my order about his recommendations for sides. He said-definitely the fries and the baked beans. The baked beans were delicious! Also sweet with a little kick at the end and then with a little sweetness to it. I just want to take the time right now to say that I hate beans-the consistency of it and the way that they're often overloaded with lard/butter. As mentioned above, yummy and on top of that he said that if I didn't like either of the sides he recommended to let him know and he would get me something else. 

I tried the ribs which were so soft that it basically came apart in my fingers, the sauce was consistent throughout. My friend placed an order of the 'doughnuts' as he called it but they were sugar fried biscuits. We waited and waited, ordered them to-go and even then they weren't ready. The counter-man, who must have been the manager then asked the unseen Forrest what was going on with the damn sugar fried biscuits and then said he was going to give back the money for the biscuits. That's really an extra step in fixing a slight problem in an otherwise small kink."
5,"Amazing service, and very knowledgeable. I would come again, and recommend to anyone. Jimmy was helpful--great job."
5,AZ science center is great for kids and fun its good for ages 5-11 it has great activities and i have no problem with it
5,"The online cab ordering/payment system makes calling a cab such a breeze. You can order in advanced (at least one hour ahead of time), or you can ask for a cab to be sent as soon as one is available. The online system also allows you to track your cab (once it has been assigned to you) and gives you an estimated time of arrival (fabulous!). 

Side note: I noticed that calling the number they have listed on their website is a huge pain in the ass and the hold time is always longer than their estimate. As such, I really appreciate the new ordering system because it allows me to bypass the wait time on the phone and to avoid speaking to operators who sometimes have trouble understanding what I am asking for. 

When the cab arrives at your address, a text is sent to your phone and you are able to communicate with the driver via text (in case of delay/change of plans, etc.).

Also, since you enter your credit card number into the online ordering system, once you get to your destination and are ready to 'pay' for the ride, all you have to do is sign a piece of paper and write in the amount of tip you want to leave, and everything is set. There is no need to pull out your wallet and risk leaving it in the cab or dropping it on the street!

Thumbs up, Union Cab! I'm in love with all this technology!! 

PS. If you get cab #59, you are in for a treat. The driver is a real sweetheart and a great conversationalist. Ask him for advice on which airlines to take and you'll get a lot of good tips and tricks. :)"
5,"We parked across the arena in a public parking lot where the attendant attracted us by waving a flourescent flag signaling us to see the $8 public parking sign.  He/she directs you where to park since it is completely dark, but rather safe. You pay him up front and he will have change readily available.  We attended the Phoenix Suns vs Detroit Pistons game on a Friday and the crowd was very lively and enthusiastic about their Suns. (I was incognito, rooting for the Pistons).  Food selection is great, lots of snacks and alcohol.  I purchased a hat and t-shirt from the merchandise store and after the game we snapped a picture near the supersized PHX SUNS basketball outside."
5,"Excellent food, great prices, great service. I come here several times a week. Live next door and it is always good. 6 buck burgers can't be beat!"
1,"I went to this store 4/10/2014 and was Daniel took very good care of me upgrading my phone.
I went back 4/12/2014 with my wife to return a item that was defective and upgrade my wife's phone. My wife is handicapped and had to go to the bathroom, they told her to walk over to the McDonalds which is about 100 yards away.
My wife got pissed and so did I, after my wife left the store I approached  a female displeased with their flip additude. When I mentioned my wife having to walk that far several of the young wise mouths said so what. 
One female and one guy felt the need to mouth off over the bathroom issue, even with a handicapped person.
Of course I got pissed with their additudes and expressed my displeasure with Verizon and their wise mouths.
I told them now my wife refuses to buy from that store and they said they don't really care. They then told me to leave, that they would not do the refund.
I've been a customer since 1995 when it was Alltel, and then when Verison took over I stayed with Verison. When I mention this they said they really could care less.
Of course being 62 and handicapped myself, I then told the female and one guy for both of them to F-OFF.
The customer service has really gone down since they are the most popular wireless company in Arizona.
If I can do anything to assist in taking them down a few levels I will.
If Verizon continues to hire and employee people like this with absolutely no customer service professionalism, Verizon will fall like a rock.
If I had not gotten my new phone 4/10/14 and now being stuck with a 2 year contract I would have jumped ship and gone with Sprint.
Verizon is going to have to do a lot of butt kissing to keep me with them when the 2 years is up."
5,I have been going here since I was a small child. I love Noah's Ark!! The best part is they allow their kittens that are for sale to run free in the shop. It's great! You can play with kittens while you shop! I've gotten some wonderful cats from this store and would highly suggest you support this locally owned pet shop!!
5,This place is awesome! I usually get the VIP on the second floor. Service is always great people are always friendly and there is always something happening there! From foam parties to all dressed in white events! I would definitely recommend checking it out if you want to have an amazing time down town PHX
1,"Went here Saturday after a long absence and was reminded why there has been such a long absence.  The food was mediocre and the facility is pretty run down. 
I had the BBQ Pork, coleslaw and peach cobbler while my wife had the BBQ Pork and potato salad. We both thought the BBQ pork was a 3 or 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 and the coleslaw and potato salad were no better.  I was so looking forward to the peach cobbler but even it wasn't very good.   If you're in the area and want good BBQ go two minutes away to Hap's BBQ on Washington and 48th.  Of course Joe's BBQ in Gilbert is great too and even Famous Dave's kicks this place."
5,"Sunshine and the guys there are awesome.  Beer on sale every week.  A little bit of everything. Light bulbs to Mac and cheese and of course candy, beer and wine.  As a matter of fact they have a Growing wine selection.  The guys learn your name and get you in and out quick. What more could you want.  Salem always supports the neighborhood association also which is cool as well.  Great neighborhood convenience."
1,"All of my Culture Pass issues were taken care of by contacting Act One directly. They have called and explained to Amanda, and hopefully all other employees of this branch, how a Culture Pass works."
5,"The motherfucking dive bar of strip clubs.

If you BYOC (bring yo own company, bitches!) it is awesome. In this case, I was the company for a totally non-trashy, very classy female friend of mine who was in the mood to slum it. She lives down the block an had been wanting to check the place out for a while, so after a few hours of daydrinking, we hit the spot. 

Wow.

Stretch marks. Lots of grinding and wandering hands. Tits everywhere... and shit, that's just the male patrons, holmes. I was wearing all black (as usual) and put on my sunglasses for the lulz now and then, and my exceptionally skinny and lovely companion was paying with a stack $1's that she won in a dice game the night before... so the ladies and waitress probably figured that she was a stripper (she's actually an RN in an ICU) and that I was her coke dealer, and the guys were jealous that I was hanging with a hot babe whom I didn't have to pay for attention. So I guess that made me by default the coolest motherfucker in the place. How could I not give it 5 stars after that?

In reality we had a sociological discussion about the patrons and employees, and discussed a few articles in the latest issue of the New Yorker, which she happened to have in her purse. 

Some of the characters we saw:

Saigon '68 - Old dude who only got dances from the asian girls, reliving the glory days in 'nam.

Hombre - in his sunday finest with cowboy hat and boots, looking very confused. He might have jumped the border last week.

PCC - White haired, super thin, wrinkly cracker who probably wandered in from the Phoenix Country Club across the street, in shorts, white polo, knee high white socks, and of course velcro sneakers. He looked reminiscent of a corpse.... except when he got several dances from well endowed black women, at which point he really became alive. 

Short Dick Man - He had clearly sprouted some wood, and it wasn't very impressive. 

Vatos - galore.

So - think dive bar that is totally ghetto fab. If you wait around long enough, they'll have 2 for 1 drink specials, though I am sure that the ""grey goose"" I ordered was some shitty well shit and not the goose. Whatever. 

Ghetto fabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!"
1,"Unfortunately, they are out of business.  Looks like they closed their doors only a few days ago.  I have eaten there twice and it was very good. Don;t know why they closed but they had a Thank You banner posted for their customers.  
Too bad."
5,Barbecue was top notch at this Madison area gem. The chicken and spare ribs were full of flavor as evidenced by the thick smoke ring. The sauces complimented the meat very well and the apple vinegar cole slaw was one of the best I've ever eaten. This will be on list of places to stop on my travels to Wisconsin.
5,"I have been here 3 times now and just love it. The place is delicious, clean, and cheap. Their specialty is the chicken terryaki. I recommend getting the all white meat version ( just a bit extra ). I have had the beef bowl & the chicken bowl, these are very generous portions and have yet to be able to eat it all in one sitting.

Service is super friendly and helpful. I will be back to this place soon !"
5,OMG. Go early and get everything you have ever wanted in European carb form. Yus Yus Yus.
5,"If you are in the Phoenix downtown convention area and you are Catholic, you owe it to yourself to visit this Catholic Church. 
It is a church like no other. Its beauty is breath taking from the outside and when you step into this holy cathedral, you get a sense of belonging and feel the spirit overcome your body. 
It is a sacred place and an experience like no other."
1,"My folks love this place and I can't imagine why.  I had the chicken wrap and it could not hold a candle to the wraps at the Great Dane.
The fries are so overly seasoned they are almost impossible to eat without a huge glass of water.  Don't go there."
1,"I wouldn't recommend this place. I have to admit I didn't move here, I went somewhere else but when I toured it was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. The girl who toured me left me alone in the office for 20 minutes to fill out my own information while she ate lunch and watched tv on her computer. When I told her what I was looking for she said they were full and she couldn't show me anything. I practically had to beg her to look at the place. While the apartments were ok, I wouldn't recommend it based on the crappy service."
5,Best Tom Kha Gai ever ever! I've eaten almost everything here and it is all top of the line. Excellent service too. The owner is so committed to the cuisine being authentic she has her own kaffir lime tree at home to harvest the leaves.
1,"Pretty bad. They have recently changed the name. Seems like a good place to go downtown, but both times I have been were terrible experiences. 
Incredibly poor service by the bar staff and servers. I thought the first time might be a fluke but the second time proved worse. Food was nothing more than mediocre both times. If you HAVE to go, DO NOT order the artichoke dip. Absolutely terrible."
1,"This place use to be nice to eat at.  Now it's a dive!  The restaurant is filthy, I got a water glass with Lipstick on it and our coffee cups had dried cranberry juice on it.

I've been there multiple times thinking ""it's just an off day"",  The last time I went there was a week ago when a friend was visiting from Palm Springs and I have to say, I was embarrassed after taking him there!  They got his order wrong, our dishes were dirty and the waitress seemed annoyed that we even mentioned it.

I will never go there again."
5,"This place is awesome. If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting for? The Prince of Thai's and Senorita-no-meata are my favorites but they have lots of different wraps. So GOOD! Beware around lunch time (mon-fri) it can get pretty busy and you might be waiting for 20 minutes to order and get your food. If time is of the essence pre order your food. 

**Yes parking is a pain and lunch time gets packed for all you men out there .  .. . . this place has tons of meat packed wraps for your taste buds too."
5,"1 Star: Being greeted by the sweetest, wittiest older Japanese woman upon entering

1 Star:  Every photo of every menu item on the wall makes you want to order them all

1 Star:  Wonderful sticky rice, imported Panko and grain fed Chicken

1 Star:  The clientele of firemen, business types and hipsters lets you know this is a local joint

1 Star:  The older lady saying, ""Excuse my Boarding School reach,"" when she grabs your tea to refill for the 3rd time.

This is delicious, low cost Japanese comfort food.  Teriyaki, Panko Fish, Sushi, Japanese Curry.  Delicious."
5,"This is not only the best Mexican place in Arizona but the best Mexican place we have ever run across in the van (which is hard to admit as Californians raised on exceptional Mexican food - except Dave, the Phoenix native who discovered this place, and delights in its dominance). 

Chips and Salsa are top notch, always a good sign to start a meal. The menu suffers from the common Mexican restaurant problem of offering too many dishes. Sometimes you just want to know what they do well. and the giant Denny's menu is not usually a great sign. But to their credit, everything is always delicious. Highly recommended!"
5,"First time here was Leather and Lace night in Oct. 2009. Finally an adult place to have adult fun. Not a bunch of college kids goofing around and giggling like fetish night at The Cardinal. This was much more mature and so much fun! Everyone friendly. So many beautiful sexy people. Loved the guy in the mesh shirt, hee hee! Ended up getting quite naughty and I cannot wait to return. I thought it was much larger than I expected, with the dance floor in the front, the middle area bar, and then the whole area in the back with two more bars there.
Finally I have a place to go play!
Kissy"
5,"Meatloaf with red wine gravy and amazing mashed potatoes, followed by the best bumbleberry pie ever. Best place for comfort food. Did I mention the pie??"
5,"Ryan's isn't exactly a secret but I didn't know about it until recently. Any phx pet owner really should know about this warehouse. Why pay twice as much for a crate, leash, toy, etc at a normal store? Besdies food and some specialty items, I will buy everything here from now on!"
5,"We had dinner here with family after Thanksgiving. OMG!  Their fried chicken is the best I've had in my 59 years!  Moist, salty...but not too...perfectly done!  From the Key Lime Martini to the cinnamon rolls at the end...fantastic!  For my Texas friends who will understand...this is better than Babe's!"
5,"Shortly after we relocated to Madison, our dog began having seizures. It's a scary thing to experience and figuring out how to manager her epilepsy has been a challenge, but I cannot imagine going through it without the care we have received at All Pets. Getting in for an appointment has never been difficult, and the response time to questions has been extremely quick, which is much appreciated when we're anxious about our pup. The staff has been great at helping put some of our fears at ease. We have only seen Dr. Haroldson, who is unbelievably patient, helpful, and kind in answering our numerous questions, whether it be over the phone, by email, or in person. When we bring our dog to All Pets, she never seems anxious or fearful, as she had occasionally at our old vet's office, which I can only attribute to the genuine love and care the entire staff seems to exhibit towards all the animals that come in. to their clinic. I would recommend All Pets to any pet owner I know with no hesitation."
5,"I wanted to swap out the straight handlebars on my hybrid bike for backswept bars.  They guys here were very knowledgeable and helpful.  They spent a lot of time with me to review several different style handlebars, and helped me find a set that are very comfortable and that accommodate all of the stuff I had on my bike.  They also helped me pick out a newer set of front and back lights (and did not just push me toward the most expensive options, either).  The work was done on time and for less than I had expected to pay.  Super friendly, and no Gearhead attitude.  I highly recommend them, and definitely plan on returning to this shop if my bike needs anything in the future."
5,"white people dash into the grocery store to pick up a bottle of chard to go with their olive garden take-out, mexicans go to the grocery store to shop, eat some food, buy some bootleg cd's and see their cousin at the checkstand and make a day out of it. PHXRNCHMRKT embodies this tradition and so much more. the entire left side of this megastore is like 15 excellent restaurants all smashed together. after you order your food, walk to the jugeria (spanish for jugeria) and order a large horchata mixed with strawberry."
1,This place used to be awesome. Now it is plain dirty. Food quality is unpredictable and mostly poor.
5,"Here in Phoenix for business and since eating by yourself is not fun....I wanted a local spot to enjoy dinner.  And oh boy did I find a GREAT spot.  Welcome Diner provides a unique atmosphere and the weather was awesome.  

I highly recommend the KoKo - Chicken Biscuit Sandwich with a creamy spicy sauce, fried chicken, arugula, tomato and some other stuff with a side of watermelon.  Absolutely delicious!!!

I also treated myself to the Beignets which were so good and I wish I could have finished them all but I was stuffed.

And get a Hurricane; fresh and perfect too!

Staff was great, friendly and if I am back in Phoenix again, I will definitely come back to the Welcome Diner!"
1,"Oregano's, you are vile, and I am baffled by your crowds of followers who seem willing to loiter about in 115 degree heat for over an hour for you. Everything tastes as if someone had an accident with the salt shaker in the kitchen. Bland, boring, and dehydrating. No thanks."
5,Great service and such a great place to stay! This place has a lot history and great stories behind it! The security guard Dennis is so incredibly nice and knowledgeable about the history of the hotel as was very happy to take the time to share it with us. The rest of the staff was very helpful as well.
1,"I usually like to visit a place twice before I review, but there were so many issues with my first visit, it's highly unlikely I'll return. 

To start with, it's hotter than Hades in there! 
It's a greenhouse. 
It's summer. 
I get it. 
But their structure is so small and plants are packed together so closely, that it's really difficult to roam around with a cart and peruse their selection. I felt hot and uncomfortable the entire time, bumping into plants, bumping into other shoppers...

And let's talk about the selection real quick, which I was told by multiple sources is the best in Madison. I've since been to several greenhouse and I'm here to tell you, their selection is on par with Felly's in Fitchburg and a few other larger greenhouses around town. They might have a rare item here and there that you won't find elsewhere, but navigating the uncomfortable heat and nearly un-shoppable aisles isn't worth it in my opinion. 

As far as the staff goes, I was pretty bummed that nobody wanted to lend a helping hand when I needed it. I went with a hanging planter and the idea that someone there would be able to point me towards things that would work well on my shaded balcony, but it was like pulling teeth trying to get any answers. And I asked a few folks for their best recommendations, both gave sort of general sort of apathetic recommendations. I certainly could have done some research on my own and gone there knowing which plants to pick up, but for the prices they charge, I think a little knowledge and expertise isn't out of the question. Tell me what I need, tell me how to care for things. That seems reasonable to me.  

I just didn't feel like they wanted to help me or cared to have my business and that's the worst feeling someone dropping close to $100 can have at a business."
5,"Spent a Saturday driving around to the breweries in the area, and this was hands down my favorite.  The atmosphere during the tour was super casual, the bar inside was full of friendly bartenders/tour guides. (Bier Garten was closed as it was practically winter.) This was my favorite tour because the guides actually describe the process of making beer and tastings were handed out rather copiously."
5,"Alice Cooper'stown is a ""must go"" when your in downtown Phoenix. Owned by rockstar legend Alice Cooper himself, this high level atmosphere restraunt indeed makes you want to rockout.

The menu offers a tasty variety of meals, even vegitarians are not forgotten here.

Up for a challenge?? Try the Big Unit Hot Dog!! Or the Rob Zombie burger that will change your life and never look at burgers the same again.

This is also a great location to go eat before a Arizona D-Backs game or Phoenix Suns game.

Services is excellent and the bar is really nice with TV's all around you throughout the restraunt.

Around the restraunt, the memorabilia will take you back in time as you will see signed posters, photos, musical equipement, famous sport athletes.

Don't miss out on this experience! GO!"
1,"Let me start by saying, historically, I like Best Buy. I like what they stand for, I like their products and I like their customer service. For these reasons, when I recently bought a condo and I was in need of a washer, dryer, refrigerator and television, the first place I looked was Best Buy. However, I picked the wrong Best Buy to make my purchase. 

This review is not about ALL Best Buys. This is about the Best Buy on 20th and Camelback. 

Like I said, I purchased a washer, dryer and television and the Geek Squad mounting from this Best Buy. 

The washer, dryer and TV were to be delivered on a Saturday morning by 10:30 a.m.  I received the call on Friday confirming my delivery. On Saturday at 10 a.m. the delivery truck arrived, but there was one MAIN problem. They only had the dryer. Where were my TV and washer? Good question. Well, the washer was on a truck that apparently ""broke down"" while coming from California. Best Buy didn't bother calling me to tell me that my washer wouldn't be delivered. The television was a whole other story. The sales associate apparently filled out the form incorrectly, and so the order was cancelled. Was I called about either of these issues? No. It wasn't until I talked to the delivery company and 3 different people at Best Buy to ""resolve"" the problem. At this point it was too late to have my items delivered on Saturday and because I work, I had to wait another week to have them delivered.

But, this saga isn't over yet. When they messed up my order, they PROMISED me I would have my washer and television delivered by 10:30 a.m. the following Saturday since they messed up my order. I had to be somewhere at 11 so it was impertinent it was delivered before then. They said, not a problem and promised it would be there. 
I called the Geek Squad on Thursday to confirm that my TV would be installed and delivered Saturday. They confirmed that the Geek Squad would arrive WITH the TV and install it. 

I then got a call from the delivery truck about my washing machine (remember, they promised it would be there by 10:30 am.) They told me the washer would be delivered between 1-3 pm. I had to argue for a half an hour with the manager before he  final ""pulled strings"" to ""accommodate"" my original delivery request. 
But...it's not over yet. 

The second Saturday morning arrives. The washer gets there. Check that off the list. Then, the Geek Squad arrives to install my TV. Remember, they PROMISED me they'd arrive with the TV. Guess what. They didn't. The poor guys had no idea they were supposed to pick up the TV. In fact, I learned that they aren't even allowed to pick up deliveries from this store. So, my installation guys are there and the TV is missing yet again. They did me a HUGE favor and actually drove across town to this store to pick up the TV (shocking fact; these guys don't work at the store on Camelback. They work at the one on Frank Lloyd Wright). So, they go all the way to the Camelback location to pick up my TV....which they learn was about to be shipped to Texas for some random reason. If they hadn't picked up my TV, I'm sure I'd still be missing it today. Was I ever called by Best Buy with an apology? No. 

I don't think I need to explain further why I would never shop at this Best Buy again. I bought my refrigerator from the Best Buy on Shea and it went off without a hitch. 

So my Yelp friends, if you want a seamless experience with your pricey purchases of major appliances, I would suggest you shop anywhere but the Best Buy on Camelback and 20th. Not only did they mess up my order on multiple levels, the sales associate staff was rude on top of it. 

This is not the experience you want when you are making a large financial commitment."
1,"Why is everyone standing around?

It was a slow night and they were obviously over-staffed. But no one was really anxious to help me out. I was shuffled from the battery center, to the front desk, to the service center and then stood  there awkwardly while the employees made casual conversation and no one told me there was a waiting area. 

I just came in to get a new battery for my car. Kinda peeved that I paid for installation, if you can even call it that. Autozone does it for free with purchase and I thought most places did too. Not these Pep Boys. I should have went elsewhere but my car needed it bad. Oh well... live and learn."
5,"I was actually pretty shocked to see any negative reviews for Fate on here.  The whole bun scenario listed a few reviews down sounds like a fiasco, but thankfully i've never had a negative experience there, and i've been there god only knows how many times.

Fate is my favorite restaurant.  i discovered it late one night (well, early morning, actually) after helping a friend shoot a burlesque show downtown.  I was amazed that they were open that late (I think it was one...maybe two A.M.?).  He insisted that I'd be amazed, and I was.  

I have had to wait a few times to get in, but usually that was because it was First Friday.  It's understandable, because it's a small place (like most of the places downtown), and it's pretty popular.  Besides, you can always call ahead and make a reservation if you don't want to wait.  It's not a big deal.  

The service the first time and each subsequent visit was excellent, and the food was brought out ridiculously fast.  The crab puffs are to die for, and I honestly have trouble narrowing down which martini is the best.  The pad thai martini is just amazingly weird enough to be good, but the spicy cucumber is out of this world.  I've tried a number of dishes, but I always come back to the spicy Saigon with shrimp.  I'm glad I don't live nearby, or I'd go there all the time.  This way it's always a treat when I go."
1,"Used these guys for a warranty repair. The 1st couple of people I spoke to on the phone were very nice, however flexibility for scheduling was not there. The first person said I could ask for a specific time, the 2nd person said I could only choose a time frame, the 3rd person said they pretty much ignore that and schedule by geographics.  AND online they even say, 'a time convenient for you. And by the time we were able to get a mutual time for the repair, the tech was unpleasant. The appliance did get fixed.  5 stars for getting the appliance fixed, 0 stars for the tech's attitude. Not sure how to rate being pleasantly lied to about scheduling."
1,The worst tuna sandwich I ever had and the most expensive.
1,"What a racket. This is everything that is wrong with economies of scale. 

-You will spend excessive amounts of time on hold.
-You may never actually speak to a doctor. Good luck even getting to a PA.
-Everyone you do get a hold of on the phone will pass the buck and transfer you to another department.
-No one takes any personal responsibility. It is always someone else's job or it's just the way the system works, etc.
-After ""urgently"" ordering me to rush in for an MRI and collecting their $$, it was damn near impossible to get service from TOCA. 

Working with TOCA has led to nothing but half-baked information and a HUGE hassle.

Too big for their own good. You will feel like a commodity and not a patient."
1,"I'm a transplanted Texas girl from Austin. I was craving a taste of home and saw reviews for this place. The atmosphere is great, the waitress was amusingly surly. Sadly the food was terrible. I don't understand actually having a disclaimer on your menu that you don't season your meat?! However that would explain the ridiculous amount of condiments at the table. I ordered the chicken fried steak and was saaaaaadddly disappointed. It is NOT authentic to not season this dish. It literally tasted like a cube steak dipped in a flour/water paste then deep fried. No self-respecting Texan would do this, and you certainly wouldn't add pepporcini pepper sauce or Cholula sauce to a real CFS!  The meat was not the only thing unseasoned, the chicken tenders, potatoes, biscuits and pretty much everything else was tasteless and so bad I couldn't eat it and I LOOOOVE anything fried, so this is pretty bad. We actually felt kind of bad for them when they saw how much food was on the table and we didn't want a take home box.   

I advise they add salt & pepper at the least."
5,"The Blue Fin is my favorite Teriyaki stop in the valley.  

To begin, the service here is awesome!  For such a casual restaurant, they really know how to make you feel welcome.

I absolutely love the food here too.  Great appetizers, spring rolls, inari, sunomono, etc.  Being vegetarian, I always order the same...Steamed Vegetable Bowl.  For the money, you get a TON of food here.  The teriyaki sauce is perfect, not too sweet like some of those chain places.

Did I mention that the service here is the best?

The only thing wrong with The Blue FIn; they are not opened on the weekends, Monday through Friday only."
1,"I have eaten here many times, the menu has changed, food is OK.  $1.95 for sour cream, REALLY???  Enough said!  I will not be back."
1,"For starters, this place has a very strong moldy smell to it. From looking at the old stained carpets, this seems where it may be comming from.  Next, I ordered a soda and my glass was dirty and had oily stains from it.  I've been to other Denny's Resturants, but this by far is the dirtiest establishment I've been to.  I was afraid to try the food, fearing that the Kitchen (shielded from view) would be worse than what customers are able to see.  I would recommend someone inspect the air quality and cleaniness of this establishment."
1,"Omg. MOLD, mold everywhere!!!! 

I bought two potato filled pastry's we get 3/4 through eating them and my boyfriend goes ""Is that mold"" we then pick the pastry shell apart and the entire thing is filled with thick black mold. This was hours after they were purchased! 

In about an hour we were both feeling sick, I threw up which was terrible. I'm posting a picture of the nasty moldy food we got. I'm shocked. I eat out everyday and have NEVER EVER had an experience like this. 

I ordered Borsch off the menu as well, and they were out so he just opened a can they had on the shelf and added tap water (for $8.95) I have to say one word...

HORRIFIED!"
5,"I absolutely love this place! I drive 30 miles from Mesa to eat at Rosita's Place every chance I get. Been coming here for at least 10 years or more. Best Mexican food in the valley. Their green corn tamales. Yum! Cheese enchiladas, red or green are the best....and not to forget the awsome refried beans."
1,"The pizza has really never been any good but at one time it was a pizza and wings combo at a decent price. At this point, it's just overpriced greasy food. Bummer."
1,"DO NOT GET MARRIED HERE! This resort is beautiful from the outside, but start peeling back the layers and you will see an ugly company that will nickle and dime you at every turn. My wedding experience turned from one of joy and happiness to a feeling of dread and nausea at every turn with this company.  THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW UP FRONT: Expect to pay a 22% service charge that is TAXED with the sales tax + the regular sales tax on top of your bill. Also, plan to spend $100 per bartender and be expected to tip several key people during the reception, despite the service charge. Also, plan to pay $4.00 per every car that valets at your wedding. If you want a list of who actually used the valet, forget it. Expect to meet every deadline they give you with your payments, but do not expect such promptness from them. And if you use their ""preferred vendors,"" remember who some of those vendors really work for at the end of the day... I have my contract on record for anyone who wants a glimpse at the ""whole picture."" Trust me when I say that the beautiful, sugary sweet image you get on your initial visit, will not depict the financial reality here."
5,"I was looking to create some custom signs for my themed birthday party and turned to FASTSIGNS because it is located just a few blocks from my house. I was really glad I ended up choosing them because my experience was really great. 

To start with, when I emailed the online quote request, I got a prompt - and very thorough - response from Jeff. Unlike some businesses that respond to quote requests with a zillion other questions, Jeff took a stab right away at specs/materials and an estimate. This made me so much more likely to engage and really saved me a lot of back-and-forth (which I just don't have time to do during the work week). 

When I picked up the signs, they were great quality and the work was as I pictured it. I also thought the prices were reasonable for custom signs. 

Overall, I was very happy with my FASTSIGNS experience and would definitely go back for any future sign needs!"
5,"Best of Philly in my opinion is hands down the Best Cheese Steak in the Valley.

They build sandwiches to your liking with fresh baked bread, lean steak grilled with olive oil and real American cheese. 

Yes the place is small, however the owner has a giant heart. He and his wife have stayed true to form and their passion for cleanliness and quality shines through with every menu item.

My business partner and I have made the pilgrimage to Best of Philly in Phoenix every week from Tempe for six years running.

Best of Philly experimented with a second location in Mesa; however, they sold that store off, so be sure to stick to the real deal and grab a coupon from the website."
5,"So I'm sitting in the trolly car at The Old Spaghetti Factory in Newport Beach, CA trying to figure out what to order. Then I noticed I've been to many of the locations listed on the menu. So it hit me, I need to type up a review for each location I've been to. But the truth is that they are all good. The food is yummy and I think the home made salad dressing us the best. I love the atmosphere and of corse the garlic bread. If you have not been to one of the many locations I highly recommend you give them a try. If your in vacation and want a fun family restaurant give them a call and bake a reservation because some times the wait is long."
1,"Picture it, if you will.  Little old me, drinking at the Bikini Lounge from 2 in the afternoon until midnight with 3 friends.  Drinking, drinking, drinking.  So after 10+ hours of living solely off of beer, there can surely be no better idea than going to a strip club.  Right?

So we pack up and head on over.  A high cover (sorry, for the life of me I don't remember how much) and a 2 drink minimum (which I do realize is standard) later, we're immersed in black light.  As my eyes adjust, I start to see that this is really not the crowd I expected to see in a strip club.  There is ZERO energy.  No talking.  No laughing.  Nothing but rows of guys sitting and looking blankly at the dancers.

We found some empty chairs in the back, and settled in there, and I was able to turn my attention to the girls.  Ok, look:  I know they can't all be Elizabeth Berkley (may the Lord keep her feisty Nomi Malone safe and warm forever).  But I didn't expect this apathy.  Bored looking women taking their short turns on the small round main stage, and more bored looking women walking around offering lapdances in vain.  The thing about stripping is this:  I thought the point was that you could make a lot of money.  But we were there at midnight on a Saturday night, and these girls were getting NOTHING.  In the hour we were there, I saw ONE man put money in a girl's pants on stage... and I watched, and it was a one dollar bill.  Seriously.

I sat there with my 3 friends (2 men, one other woman), all of us in a row, all of us suddenly sober, staring with our eyes and mouths wide open.  I could feel my male friends' good mood deflate (ha!  don't be dirty), as my girl friend and I felt like gender traitors just by being there.

I thought these kind of places were supposed to be rowdy and fun.  Was I expecting too much?  It was the most depressing experience.   I sort of feel bad even writing this, because nobody involved with that joint can be happy, I'm sure.  But I figured I owe it to all you Yelp gentleman (and the ladies, too...who am I to presume?) to steer you away from this one."
1,"This place is bad. BAD!

I went for a cheaper hotel in Phoenix, since it was going to be a quick trip. But $65/night in Phoenix should have gone further. I also am a Wyndham Rewards member, and wanted to rack up loyalty points... I don't know if I will ever bother staying at a Days Inn ever again.

1) Welcome to the ghetto. It is seriously surrounded by project-style tenements. Blue Moon Nude dancers, a window-less brick building is across the street. I am pretty sure someone rented a room here on an hourly rate, as I was awoken to LOUD sex from 5-6 AM coming from the room next door, who checked in at 4:45 and checked out at 6:05. Wham bam thank you madam...

2) The airport shuttle is slow.

3) The continental breakfast is a joke.

4) The staff is not friendly.

5) The room stank of cigarette smoke - it was suppose to be non-smoking. The bathrooms were nasty. And there was a wet spot on the carpet. I also found a ridiculous love letter someone had left behind... And while that was incredibly amusing, the fact that the cleaning staff had missed it spoke volumes about their attention to detail.

Don't do it, unless you are DESPERATE!"
1,This was adequte at best and that is being generous.  Several of us Went today for Easter brunch - big disappointment.  The restaurant was not that busy - took 20 minutes between courses being served.  Needed to ask for plates for the muffins.  Ordered the filet with eggs - the eggs were burnt and broken.  The server never should have brought that plate to the table.  I expect this from Denny's at 3 am - not a restaurant with these menu prices.  My boyfriend had the tomato bisque soup - was Ragu in a bowl - even same consistency.  Another friend had the bananas foster french toast - even the bananas were bland.
1,"This company has moved but never changed their address on their website.  Their new address is 3131 E. Camelback Road, Suite 200, Phoenix, AZ  85016. Their phone number is 602-508-1883.  They are located at 32nd Street and Camelback."
1,My cheese enchiladas had non-melted cheese in them. That's a basic prerequisite for enchiladas - melted cheese. Not impressed at all. This place is sophomoric at best. There are far more tastier places in the valley to spend your money on. If I could leave a half star I would. I will never eat here again.
1,My boyfriend and I recently visited this bar because we just moved into the area. The moment we walked in the bartenders were rude and unfriendly. They asked for our       IDs and they were whispering and rolling their eyes at us even though we are both 23. We ordered a pitcher of beer and both of the bartenders went into the back to get glasses and came out with glasses that were sticky with lipstick and seemed as if they hadn't even been washed.  We didn't even end up drinking the entire pitcher since the glasses and pitcher were so dirty and sticky. No matter how close this bar is to us we will never go back. They were rude and wrongly rude and disgusting to us
5,We love the food. The drinks. The atmosphere. But mostly we love our server. Thinking about inviting him to Thanksgiving.
5,"After giving up on Coco's 2 years ago due to bad service and bad food, I decided today I needed something strawberry.  I read the reviews in Yelp and they seemed positive for 2013, so I decided to give it a try.  I am not sorry!  The manager Earl and the waiter Robert were as attentive and aware of me as it gets.  They both made me feel welcome and I was seated and waited on as soon as I walked in the door.  I ordered right away and my food was ready in minutes.  The food was great, the service was great, and the whole experience was the best I have had in a long time.  Welcome back Coco's and kudos to Earl and Robert!"
5,"I sure like listening to Shappy on ""The Dave Pratt in the Morning Show"" on KMLE. I hated country but now I'm starting to like some country artists. So thank you KMLE."
5,"I recently visited Madison and went to Monty's.  Monty's is honestly such a great diner.  I especially love their chicken pot pie...very filling and so, so good.  The turkey soup is really yummy as well.  And the pies...absolutely amazing!!  

I really like the feel of the restaurant.  It's a great a place to go to and meet up with friends for sure.  Great service as well!  (Leslie is an awesome server:-)

Overall, a great diner all around.  Highly suggest (especially the desserts!)"
5,This place is amazing! They should call it chateua of the valley! double french doors open and a grand master ballroom straight out of the sixties awaits your every sinking appetite. Beus and Belles unite! This is a  real ball! Candlight sessions held every thursdays at 8:30 p.m. Also used as a meditational facility for the poor.
1,"It's one of that consignment stores that refuses clothes one originally bought from them because the labels aren't designer enough. 

I would never shop here again, since if I pay $40 for a skirt, wear it twice, and decide it doesn't work for me, they'll snootily refuse it as inferior to what they stock, obviously, in tones of ""how dare I sully their store with this trash?"" They even accused me of lying about ever having an account with them, when I'd said I wasn't sure and it was from years ago. 

In fairness, I would swear the place has changed management or employees. It used to be possible to buy high-end office clothes here and the staff were nice. Now it's a trophy-wife clothes, staffed by the rudest, snootiest women I've ever encountered in a clothing store. I should probably be grateful I now don't have store credit I'd have to use there."
1,"This place barely earned a one star! 
Went here on a groupon recently, it'd been years since we ate here.  I Remember it being pretty good then. 
Let me sum it up: we ordered the 9.95 (sandwich, side & drink combo) the beef was burnt dry, the sauce reminded of a grade up from Arby sauce & the fries tasted stale. I Thought I was being  negative but my husband who's not too picky complained more than me. To top it off, we were charged extra for a side we didn't order when we presented this to the cashier she swore we ordered it, we didn't! She finally gave us 1/2 a refund saying we didn't get tax back because of groupon..... huh???? Our original order came to 18.00 the groupon was for 20. 
Whatever!   We're never going back!!"
5,"Nice facility. Not a bad seat in the place. I went here to see My Fair Lady....Theater meets the symphony! What a show! 

There is a parking garage attached to the symphony hall. I was lucky; I found parking in front, on the road! :-)

Great experience. I will definitely be back."
5,"Phoenix Ranch Market III is an absolute MUST for any person visiting Phoenix, Az. Forget the upscale breakfast and faux southwest shops that dot and line Scottsdale. Forget the 'burbs of Peoria, Goodyear, and East Mesa. Don't let your visiting family leave without making a trip down to the Phoenix Ranch Market on 16th st and Roosevelt. Yes, this is south of the I-10 freeway and far away from your faux mexican food at Macayo's Cantina. At Phoenix Ranch Market you'll find a side of the city that nearly all of the transplanted surburban population seems to want to ignore, or just completely forget. This is Phoenix being Phoenix, not Phoenix trying to be a new Los Angeles or anyplace else.

After having breakfast at a carbon copy brunch eggery, I was in need of something less perfect and faux. I found exactly what I was craving. When you can hear the sounds of mariachi or radio campesina from your car parked at the other end of a packed lot, you know this isn't the local Kroger you're about to enter.

Part grocery store, part food court, part village market, PRM is huge, it's overwhelming and it's surprisingly clean and comfortable - this isn't a low rent grocery like Food City. With a fresh seafood section two or three times the size you'd find anywhere else in Phoenix, and with parts of animals you've probably never prepared at home, it's fun to just look, but even more fun to buy. Want meat? Want better options? Better cuts? Want an entire skinned cow's head with the eyes intact and staring at you? Check. It's all SO GOOD.

But that's just the meats. They make their own tortillas onsite with a literal factory and small army of workers churning out the flat corn and flour awesomeness. Hungry? Want mexican food? Want great mexican food? ALWAYS consider going here. Think of anything on a restaurant menu and you have it here. Prepared fresh, and a la carte. Seriously. Tamales of any kind. Horchata! Cow Tongue! Burritos of immense size and stuffed with anything you want. Some of the best beans in town, rice, and parts from a pig that still actually look like parts from a pig. This isn't the mall food court.

The place is packed with mostly hispanic families but you'll also notice a few adventurous types, including my asian self. Most of the employees speak english very well so language is not a barrier. The only times you'll need help is when asking what is that? And like mentioned above, the answer just might be cow tongue (which by the way, is good, however I can see how the texture would turn some people off. Imagine a soft almost too mushy beef...)

Oh. The food is also cheap. You'll get more than full off of $5, you'll explode at $10. It's seriously like heaven here. Music, people, atmosphere, food, drinks, desserts, baked goods. All of it awesome. I met up with my friend Amy.The.Kidd for 'lunch' and we ended up spending almost 4 hours just walking around, back and forth, trying each new item we found, or trying the standards but knowing they were going to be better here. Mmmm. Horchata, great corn tamales, rice, beans, empanadas, warm fresh tortillas... bring everyone. This is a place that should be in people's minds when they think of Phoenix, not just the golf courses, or upscale Scottsdale, or Frat/Sorority Tempe... but South Phoenix. No matter how scary it is for suburban soccer moms to venture down there.

Phoenix Ranch Market on 16th St and Roosevelt. Take me anytime."
1,I think at this point they should just close there doors on this location since the owners or manager obviously don't care. They have excellent products that you cant get anywhere else but they almost NEVER have enough staff. I have gone there on over 8 separate occations and left without the merchandise I had picked out because there was no one on the registers at all or because there was only 1 person on register and huge line of people waiting. A store is pretty much worthless if you cant pay for the items. I dont steal but I would imagine they loose a lot of stuff from people waiting for a checker too long.
5,"Cheuvront is a perfect date night place.
My cute guy set up a reservation for a Thursday night out. We arrived a little early after he realized Cheuvront would close at 2100. We wanted to be sure to he our cheese and wine fix to the maximum.
I was impressed at the extensive cheese list. I lived in France for two years & this compares very well to a fromagerie in France with all the different cheeses. The staff is all quite nice and knowledgable on the menu of cheeses and wines to pair with. We selected three cheeses and asked to pair with the suggested wines. I was very impressed. The cheese plate is paired with fruits and a scatter of almonds to cleanse the palate between cheeses. My boyfriend ordered the risotto for his entree and he was asked if he wanted salmon or chicken ... It wasn't a small amount of salmon as one would expect
, but a quite moderate piece of salmon filet. I had the Cheuvront chicken served with polenta. Rarely do I finish my entire entree , but this meal was heaven in my mouth. For dessert we shared a piece of hazelnut torte and champagne. Perfect date night and worth the extra workout. The staff is wonderful and the ambience is romantic. The only two things would change is a later closing ...& not to serve dinner while the cheese course is being savoured. But because the meal and experience of Thursday night date night was so amazing ... Still earns a 5 ...& my date, spot on, is a 10 for making this such a great night :)"
1,"I rarely give 1 star reviews, but in this case I had no choice. I needed an appointment on fairly short notice so when I found Dr. Kramer had an opening for the next day I jumped on it. I made my appointment online via Zoc Doc. I was also able to fill out all my paperwork online avoiding a long wait at the office. Arrive at 3:30 for my 3:45 appointment. The office was filled with screaming children. The receptionist needed my ID and insurance card. I had to fill out a quick consent form which was fine. 

45 minutes later I'm summoned back to Dr. Kramer office. I waited another 10 minutes in there before his PA arrived. She then proceeds to ask  me every single question that I already answered online which should have eliminated this long ass process. Finally Dr. Kramer arrives at 5:00. More questions, more examining. His conclusion was that I did not have a bacterial infection. I did however have a viral infection. He prescribed a Z pack. 4 days later and I feel exactly the same. I called his office yesterday and told them what is going on. I was then told that what he prescribed won't work because I did not have a bacterial infection and viral infections go away on it's on in about 6 weeks, but the Dr. needs to see you again. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?????? I asked the lady what he was going to do different on my next visit that he didn't do on the first visit. No answer.

Needless to say, I will not be returning to Dr. Kramer. If you simply want to give your money away I suggest an organization like PAWS (pets are worth saving) because Dr. Kramer ripped me off and had the nerve to try to do it a second time."
5,"Celebrated my birthday here last night. Food was amazing. I stuck to my old standby of cheese enchiladas, which were great. The red sauce had a unique taste, it tasted like it had pot roast drippings - it was the best red sauce I've ever had. For appetizers we had the cheese crisp and guacamole. The guacamole was very good with chunks of avacado and a light hand used with the seasoning. The place is huge and the staff are very friendly. This is now my go to Mexican food restaurant."
1,"I wanted pizza and my kids wanted macaroni and cheese, so I figured I'd head to the Pit. If only somebody had answered the phone! It was around 6pm on a Saturday night, which I understand is a busy time, but come on. I let it ring about 15 times and then hung up. I paced around my house for a few minutes, got distracted, then tried calling again about ten minutes later. Same deal: lots of ringing, no answering. I let it ring another 15 times or so and just gave up. 

I don't mind having someone answer and then immediately put me on hold. It's a lot better than the nothing that I got. Thumbs DOWN."
1,"Went for my sisters bday, we parked in the empty lot infront of the club where everyone parked must have been 50 cars in the lot and got a 288$ ticket. We posted on downtown's website about it and they said that Club Downtown doesn't have a parking lot and it was our fault parking there. Total jerks. Didnt even care. The lot had no signs that we couldnt park there and we assumed it was there parking from all the cars parked infront of the club!"
1,"I would absolutely love to tell you that I discovered a gem on Thomas Road. I would love to be able to write how magnificent this place was but alas, I can't. I never got to taste anything. I never got to order anything. I walked into this dirt hole, holding my breath and tongue, and willing to order something in the hope that I could find some good Mexican food (good Mexican food is actually an oxymoron), anyway, I stood where it said ""order here."" I stood, and stood, I looked around, it appeared there was still business being conducted. A couple were eating in a booth. Hmmm....I stood. Waiting. No one came out from the back to acknowledge me, or take my order.

Now this isn't Pizzeria Bianco where if you ignore me I will wait. If you spit on me I will wipe it off and take the abuse to be able to experience the pizza. No, this is a dirty, disgusting Mexican dump situated a few feet across from an hourly motel and down the street from a strip club. This place should be lucky anyone has walked in and kiss my feet. Well, I gave up, I started to walk out and just as I was heading to the door, some ""person"" walked out from the back. I left.

If the service is that bad, I can't believe the food is going to sway me otherwise. In fact, I feel like I was saved from a case of botulism or diphtheria."
5,"Welcome Diner recently reopened with the chef/owners of Old Dixie food truck.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  I've been to Welcome Diner three times in the past two weeks.  I've sampled the lemon ricotta pancakes, the Holy Puerco special and a breakfast biscuit sandwich.  All were delicious, but the Holy Puerco was amazing.  A cheesy grit cake smothered in the most delicious pork I've ever eaten, topped with an egg and house-made pork cracklings, served with flavorful, crunchy potatoes...

I love to sit at the counter.  The crowd is friendly and the WD team is personable and efficient.  There is also plenty of seating outside, as there are only 9 stools at the diner counter.  And since it's in my neighborhood, I can easily walk or bike there.

Food is locally sourced when possible.  I was there yesterday when the guy dropped off the duck eggs.  Most entrees are in the 8-10 dollar range.  They have beer, wine, and limited cocktails.  I highly recommend the Hurricane, with fresh-squeezed juices, light and dark rums, and pomegranate grenadine.  And the new management DOES take credit/debit cards with the square.  You can have your receipt sent to your email or phone number.  I mention this because I saw a couple order who'd never paid with the square before.

Welcome Diner is open for brunch and dinner, but not every day.  I know they close at 3 on Sundays.  They are open Thur. thru Sun.  Oh, and the music is good, too!  Get there and enjoy the patio before the hot weather hits!"
1,"Gross.  Went to Noodles for lunch on a Saturday, place was not busy.

Bathroom was disgusting.  Dirty floor and wet.  No paper towels.  Smelled.

Plates and bowls (all of them) were chipped.  Not sanitary."
1,"I feel horrble to have to say this to my fellow yelpers, but working with Checker Pool and Pump Supply was a horrible experience.  The whole thing.  From the intial phone call I made to the office to the final installation of the new motor.  Just awful.

First the phone call to the office was less than desired. The fellow who answered the phone wasn't terribly helpful and told me that he couldn't schedule anything, but he would send my call to one of his ""technicians.""  Okay.

A couple hours later a technician called. He was abrubt and abrassive in his tone, asking me to describe what was wrong and then interrupting me when he figured out that he knew better than I did what the description was.

He came and diagnosed the problem while I was at my office in Chandler. He very tersely told me, ""either I come in an hour or on Monday.""  I had just come back home to 114 degree weather, so I thought it better he come quickly than wait 5 days.  So he came.

Then he called from the car and told me he had taken my motor as it needed to be repaired. I wasn't given a choice.  He just took it.  So now I can't have someone else come out and give me another price quote.  Of course, this fellow still hadn't told me what was wrong or what the price would be - he just took my motor and called me from the car.

When he returned on Tuesday (not on Monday as he promised because he said I didn't answer the phone soon enough for him and he couldn't leave the motor without any money from me) he installed a new motor without telling me. He told me on the phone that if he couldn't repair the motor someone would call and quote me the price for a new motor.  I guess not, and what choice did I had - he still had my old motor.  So we were forced to accept the new motor since it was already installed without a price or a pre-installation discussion.

He then told us that a pipe was cracked and that the suction for the pool pump was compromised, but he didn't fix it.  Why not offer to fix it?  And after he left, he left our pump clock on for just 2 hours.  Really?  In the summer?  And he didn't tell us the fill valve was also broken.  A cheap 20.00 part that I am sure he had on the truck would have fixed that.

The new motor was 289.00 which I am told is very fair, but then they charged 16.50 for shop labor (for what) and nearly 100.00 for the miscellaneous parts needed to install the motor, and 95.00 for his labor.  The price should have been about 385.00 in my opinion.  If he had repaired the plumbing and the fill valve so we didn't have to have someone else come by, I might have thought 580 was fair?  But now we have to have more work done on the pool by another company.

This particular technician was so horrible I am afraid to call this company ever again. He was rude to me and to my husband and"
1,"ribs were dry, hardly any meat on them, and chewy/tough. seems that management may have changed since I last visited many years ago. man at counter lacked appreciation for my business, made crude comments about women who had just left,  and was very impersonal, did not thank me for my business or even look at me when he handed my to go order to me. I doubt I'll ever return to this location. the one on central I may try once more."
5,"Love this venue. There are some really reasonably priced hotels within walking distance, and plenty of bars/clubs between which make for a perfect bar crawl to the venue. (You can hit the Crescent Ballroom, Seamus McCaffrey's, and Copper Blue, to name only a few...)...

We came here to see NIN and found the venue to be clean, staffed by really friendly people, and well organized. Lots of stands set up for drinks/food/merchandise and plenty of water fountains and bathrooms. The acoustics were great and the show was amazing."
1,"Are you a douche bag?  Do you have more money than sense?  Does it make you all warm and fuzzy to way overpay for a mediocre drink?  If so, Majerle's is the place for you!  

Personally, I never cared for the ""owner"" when he was with the Suns, and this establishment has done nothing to change that opinion.  The food is bland at best, but for the prices it should have a little flavor.  I'm not sure what criteria the staff uses when deciding who to grace with their presence, but the female servers sure weren't responding to me (a woman) even when I held out a $20.00 - my 6'3"" friend had much better luck, he was the one that had to order my drink.  

I'm disappointed, this is such an easy place to hit on a light rail pub crawl or before or after a game or concert, but I just don't think I can bring myself to go back willingly."
5,Cold beer good food good music and a cool staff ill defiantly come back!
5,"By far the best B & B I have stayed in (I have stayed in about 5 in my life thus far). Huge breakfasts that were yummy and a lovely, relaxing atmosphere. 

My co-traveler and I honestly decided to stay in the inn rather than go into Madison on a Saturday night because it was that cozy. We are not 80 but in our late 20s/early 30s!

You can hear the highway when you sit outside, but it's kind of like the sound of strong winds. It's hard to believe that the property is that close to downtown Madison, yet it's a farm. 

Although I like to try out different B & B's, just for different experiences, I would strongly consider staying there again for a weekend getaway."
5,"Cheap and fast -express !! - delicious hummus and taromasalata , the burgers weren't bad ,  a convenient location for where I was working - myself and colleagues had around fifteen meals here in the space of a week , - nothing wrong with any of them."
1,"***************************
Unsanitary Conditions
**************************
last time we ate at this ""establishment"" a cock roach crawled across the bar.  When we told the owner we were told that a shipment of produce was infected by roaches. No offer to refund the meal was offered. We delivered an email of disapproval to the owner upon which she responded with refunding the meal.

today when we returned for the first time since that unfortunate incident the owner informed us we were no longer welcome in her establishment. 

It seems a roach infestation had lowered her Maricopa Health department score - which somehow was our fault for indicating to her that there was a problem.

very disappointing.  This is a restaurant i've enjoyed for years and years but will never dine at again."
5,"This place was awesome and if you are a baseball or diamondbacks fan, and you like fridays, you will be in heaven. I had the Chicken and Cheese plate, got more than enough food, and had excellent service. The view of the field is amazing, and I highly recommend eating here."
1,The food is overpriced and so are the drinks. The atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting. The hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside. I did not enjoy coming to this place and I don't think I'll be returning.
1,"Dude. Why are they such jerks? Total attitude from the time I walked in to paying the bill. I ordered a sandwich and the guy behind the counter gave me some meal deal with half a sandwich. Then when I asked why I only was given 1/2 sandwich the woman at the register said something to the man in a different language, he said something back to her, she rolled her eyes and put out her hand to accept my credit card. I was almost going to tell them where to stick their 1/2 sandwich but i had read good things on here about the food so I took it and left.

Food was meh. Bread was cold and stale. Pastrami was nothing special. Don't bother."
5,"Thanks ray you saved me over $1000 dollars on my clutch, well worth the visit. My m is singing to a new tune. That's for being patient on my flywheel."
1,"DO NOT EAT HERE!  The food is microwaved and tastes like it came out of a box.  Yes, they have homemade tortillas, but the stomach ailment you suffer from after visiting here is totally not worth it.  Even the drinks are watered down and the place is full of viejitos.

Instead, take a short drive to Cuco's on Buckeye Rd off of Stoughton and ask for Diana.  She makes great margaritas :)"
5,"There's nothing I can add to the reviews here other than to say this is truly a five star diner.  

5 star exterior, 5 star interior, 5 star clean bathrooms
5 star cheery cool and efficient people who work there
5 star artichoke salad with a 5 star ""side"" bean salad that you could take home and have for lunch the next day: it's BIG!

5 star shakes and burgers and other old school diner food in addition to all the 5 star new wave veggie & organic options

Next time I'm in Madison I'd like to try it for breakfast."
5,"to those in search of authentic mexican cuisine, make this your go to place.  we enjoyed great food and service. decor is rustic, ah but who cares when the food is so magnificent."
5,"I had this place on a list of ""gotta try"" lunch places near my new job. Today was the day to give it a try and I was blown away. The place is super cute (tiny inside and a nice patio), awesome, unique menu, EXTREMELY friendly service and the food was killer. I chose the Bumble Bee, fried chicken breast, local honey, house made beer mustard and bread &  butter pickles on a huge homemade biscuit. How they got the chicken freakishly crunchy yet completely juicy on the inside is a mystery right up there with the Loch Ness Monster and Bermuda Triangle. For a side, I tried the fried avocado. Oh yes, I said it. Again, crispy beyond belief and soft creamy avocado on the inside. There may be voodoo happing in that tiny kitchen. I will be back to investigate further...maybe for brunch!"
5,"What I love most about Welcome Diner is that when you are there, it doesn't feel as though you are in Phoenix.  The menu is good ol' Southern comfort food with a twist; they have Deep Eddy alcohol's and they make amazing homemade lemonade...well it's a little page right out of the South (Austin, TX to be exact).  We need more places like this.  

They have a vegan po-boy sandwich with fried avocado that I could eat everyday, it's just that good.  They use the freshest veggies, no really, so fresh that it was probably picked that very day from the Garfield community garden.  That's right, fresh AND local.  I also can't get enough of those delicious collard greens!  I was impressed with the staff because they knew exactly what was vegan (right down to which bread I could eat).  Any time I find a staff educated about ingredients, it's a win.  And anytime I have gone with my non-veg friends they rave about the menu as well, so I think it is safe to say that it is all yummy.

All in all, this place is simply adorable, quaint, fun and delicious.  It is small inside so if you can get in there, I highly recommend it.  The staff is very friendly and attentive which makes for an even better dinning experience.  There are also plenty of seats outside and a to-go window which makes it even easier.  Great place to hang out, meet new people and eat good food!"
5,Always professional and reliable service for big or small jobs. I highly recommend their services.
5,"I was in the market for a new stylist since mine fled the Phoenix scene in search of cooler weather in Colorado. I went to my Aveda store to pick up some products and there was a stylist from Perry Monge, Marie Luce ( sp?) gave me a coupon for 20.00 off so I decided to give it a try.
OMG. From the moment I walked in I felt like royalty. I think I was getting the first time
service but not only did I get one of the best haircuts, a styling, a 5 minute back massage, a very thorough hand massage, a facial ( yep),eyebrow waxing, a make-up refresher and an iced cappuccino. 
I wound up buying 3 products but I always buy something Aveda when I go so it wasn't a hard sell.
I love my new look-my skin looks amazing and the total cost was 122.00 What?! I had a 20.00 off coupon but still....
It was brilliant marketing. I have found a new stylist and I will be faithful in getting a facial each time I go because it's so worth it. 
I highly recommend Marie Luce, she is amazing!"
5,"I trekked all the way to this place from the Convention Center.  I was a little unsure if I was headed to the right place, since Welcome Diner is located in a neighborhood, but I'm so glad that I found it.  My food was delicious and the staff seemed genuinely friendly and interested in how I thought that the food was, which is always the sign of a good chef.  I did have to wait a little bit, but I didn't mind too much, since it's a small establishment.  People should be forewarned that there is very limited seating indoors and that most of the seating is outdoors on the patio.  I personally thought that it was nice to sit outside, especially with the mural on painted on the fence/wall, but I understand that it might not be so comfortable to sit outside at the picnic tables in extremely hot Phoenix weather, especially if it was a busy day and you had to share a bench/table with a bunch of people you don't know.

I got a fried green tomato sandwich on sourdough with house-made corn salsa and arugula.  It was fantastically delicious.  The ingredients were fresh and everything from the toasting of the bread to the battering of the tomatoes was well-executed.  Although the sandwich was filling and came with a slice of cantaloupe, I wish that it had come with some sort of side, like home-made potato chips, for the price.  Alongside my sandwich, I had a tasty Four Peaks stout."
5,"Shame on me for not acquiescing to the frequent requests by my gf to hit up one of the most alluring valley cafes.  The Paisley Violin is gills full of progressive and retro designs and a charmingly simplistic menu of favorites, including eggwiches, croissants, sandwiches, salads, and plates containing VERY fresh ingredients like organic vegetables, cheeses, cured meats, hummus, and a variety of sauces to name just a very minimal amount.  The prices are lower than what would be considered 'reasonable' and the service is quick and attentive but not overbearing.

However, the REAL reason to visit The Paisley Violin is for the incredible ambiance, whether you sit inside in its darkened labyrinth of art, books, and counter snacks, or outside on its expansive, heavily shaded patio, complete with an artistic fountain and 6 tiny and freshly brightened bungalow houses in a pseudo shopping district right there in their back yard.  According to our server one house will contain a flower shop; one, a bookstore; and the another, a tobacco shop.  The other three are TBD.  It is a brilliant concept, which makes their back patio seem infused with organic commerce and street life, but without being invasive or 'busy'.  I absolutely cannot wait for these places to open, sipping a chai latte with a shot of espresso (my gf's signature drink called a 'dirty chai latte') and gazing at these magnificent store fronts, each painted in a wide palate.  

One other note: The Paisley Violin is no longer BYOB, as they are awaiting the lead-legs of the city to approve, get this, their LIQUOR LICENSE!  Fans of The Paisley Violin will appreciate that spirits will now be available -- although bringing your own vino to the back patio seemed like one hell of a bargain to rent their space for the evening.  

I am eagerly awaiting when alcohol will be allowed back on the premises because this place will be the gem of downtown."
1,"I seriously don't know how this place rates a three star average. Just like many other reviewers, I really wanted to like this place. The concept is great! But that's it, it's just a concept. The food is as sterile as the environment. The only thing that distinguishes one dish from the other is the texture... each item has the same bland taste. And as I am somewhat of a foodie, the thing that is most amazing is that I know you have to work to make food this blah. The ingredients seem fresh, they seem to have herbies and such to make them look good, but everything tastes like they boiled it until all the flavor was released, removed the food and tossed the good flavored broth.

I suppose if one of your favorite food combinations is mayonaise on white bread you might be impressed, but IMHO save your money and take yourself anywhere else.  :)"

5,"I have been going to Cali Nails for a few years now, I love them. I have asked for some over the top designs and they always come through. It is best to call ahead to make sure someone is available for what you need.. I typically get in and out very quickly if I call ahead. They are in a bit of a not so great area but they deal with it well. I love this Nail place they do a great job!!"
5,"I took a group of people here from work -  The service was outstanding the food was even better. I produced my ""Yelp"" coupon and it was honoured without question. The chips and salsa really get your attention, and some of the cocktails were excellent. They seated our group of 8 immediately, even while they had a large function going on outside. All who ate there were thrilled."
5,"The sad fact is that most yelpers will eschew this place for it's two more accessible neighbors - Filiberto's and La Santisma - and that is a damn shame, because nestled right between those two restaurants is a superior dining experience.  

Tacos Mexico is the truth.  Don't go expecting fancy furniture or Day of The Dead iconography - this place isn't trying to serve you a Disneyland version of Mexico - what it will give you is an authentic taste of some damn fine Mexican tacos.  

PS - their red salsa will burn a hole in your tongue.  If you treat it gingerly, however, you will be treated to a flavor bomb like no other!"
5,"Good food, good prices, good service. Simple little breakfast diner. Down to earth and delicious. If I lived here I would def b a regular!"
5,"I love, love, love this place. Does parking suck? Yes. Do they get busy at LUNCH hour? Duh. Is it small? Yes. Is it fun, locally owned with fresh ingredients and nice people that run the place? Yes, Yes, Yes and Yes. 

So to me, it's worth 5 stars and $7.82 for a wrap and side.... 

I see complaints that ppl think it's expensive, me thinks not. If you go to any other lunch time ""quick bite"" place you'll pay about the same amount (or more), unless you're talking about a franchise fast food spot. 

This place is right around the corner from where I work so I like to zip over here when I've forgot lunch or too lazy to make it. I almost always get the Turk 182 b/c I love artichokes and the Muenster cheese. I decided to branch out and tried the Sherry A'More. YUM! I don't think the food is bland, and I like flavor. I don't think they all taste the same either....the garlic rice in some of the wraps is great, and I normally don't like rice in wraps. 

Every time I go here the people are ALWAYS nice, even when getting eye rolls, sighs and rude comments from customers. Service is HUGE with me and goes a LONG LONG way so I can easily look past small inconveniences of parking and a small restaurant and the occasional mistake of the order taker..."

Took a raspberry fritter home for dessert, and that was great as well.

The woman behind the counter was helpful and made sure the glasses fit exactly right. She even complimented my girlfriend on her selection which really made me smile. All in all, great experience."
5,"i am a huge museum, history, local culture places.
but i've never been able to justify the cost of going to the heard.
as i get older i realize that some costs simply have to occur.
so we bought family membership there and spent a very pleasant 3 hours seeing 1/2 of it.

1. do all the tours if you can stand ok.
2. look for other activities, we watched hoop dancing.
3. plan on about 8 hours to see it all.
4. i have bad knees, bring my own stool, but there was plenty of sitting places.

i would have liked to learned more about the religious aspects of the katsinas.

scheduling another weekend in phoenix, watching the heard activities to catch something special, then see the scottsdale branch.

some costs are unavoidable, just do it."
1,"Usually i only get my hair done by my mom (she went to beauty school) because she is the only person that seems to know how to layer my hair and listen to what I want.  This place was the first place I got a haircut from someone other then my mom.  The first cut wasn't too bad, that's why I decided to go there again...BIG MISTAKE.  I got a different stylist that didn't seem to want to listen to what I wanted and would make me feel insecure about what I wanted by constantly saying...""oh reallyyy?"" when I wanted to make a change to what he was doing.  I seemed to get him on his off day because he was too busy complaining about all his other cuatomers that day then listening to me and focusing on my hair.  I usually give it about a week or two to really judge if i like the cut or not, but this time it only took till I got home and noticed all my uneven ends!  I had to cut them off myself. I dont think Ill ever go to a great clips again."
5,"Sometimes you want to go
Where everybody knows your name,
and they're always glad you came.

Every time I come here ...  that Cheers song comes to my head  ... I've been coming here for about a year and half and have NEVER EVER had a problem, the rooms are clean and the staff knows you here. They are all friendly... The hotel has just been redone so it looks better than it did before"
1,"ONLY TAKES CASH OR CHECK!!!

So, this is not always a deal breaker, and I have been here before and went out of my way to return. I didn't either remember this rule, or it changed since I last visited, since I usually don't carry either. They won't pay the fee for the credit card machine, but want me to dish out money for checks or ATM fees...makes me mad on principle. And there is a Starbucks literally across the street or other local joints that will gladly take my debit/credit cards down the a little ways away that I will now know to frequent instead."
5,"Our son in law brought over a great sampling of foods from Guanaquito for us to try, and I have to say it was especially good. As a gourmet cook collecting recipes for 45 years, I appreciate the homemade quality and attention to preparation and ingredients. I don't mean to seem arrogant, but it's been a rare expereince for me to enjoy that sense of satisfaction from foods prepared by others in Phoenix. This has got to be one of our best local restaurants."
5,"Excellent BBQ at excellent prices. Been driving passed this for months and finally stopped in with my girl and some friends. The pulled pork sandwich was about the best I've had in Phoenix. The sauce is good with a bit of spice. Clean environment, if not a little older. Definitely recommend."
5,"Loved this Hampton Inn!
Staff was super friendly. Close to restaurants and shopping.
Clean, comfy, and well maintained hotel, close to the highway and perfect for a quick getaway from Chicago area."
1,"Wow!  Makes Denny's like like it deserves 5 stars.

Maybe I'm a food snob, but this was some of the worst breakfast food I've ever had.  I ordered an Eggs Benedict, and the sauce over it was frankly inedible.  

My wife's special scramble was equally bad.

My 7 year old son did like his kid's meal.

This place has two things going for it:  an incredible nostalgic setting/rooms, and good to great service.  Both of those are 5 stars.

But if the food is terrible... it's hard to outweigh them.  It really was a soft underhanded pitch I made to them... all they had to do was deliver food in the ballpark of Denny's and I would have been happy as a clam.  

But they didn't, and I won't be back.  Damn shame."
1,"Bean and cheese burrito was awful. The beans tasted like the canned beans you buy at the supermarket. 
Overpriced food.  Try Filiberto's instead. Some of them have daily specials running monday thru friday."
1,Stay away from this medical center unless you have plenty of time and don't mind having your credit ruined.  My insurance company paid them and I paid my copay for one office visit.  So far I've wasted two hours proving the $100 office visit has been paid in full 8 months ago. They are now telling me I have 10 days to pay $206 (instead of the $100) or they will send this to collections. Anyone know of a good attorney?
1,"Decent wash, sloppy dry. They had my car for 1hr 40min and still did not manage to find time to dry the car nor finish wiping down the inside. I don't know if they don't have enough employees or the employees they do have just don't care but, they took my money and delivered a piss poor product and did so in an extremely lengthy fashion. Will not be returning to this rip off spot again."
5,"Our refrigerator broke 2 months ago while on vacation.  It was repaired, but I was told that I would likely need a new one soon.  Everything inside was rotten, we thought something in the house had died!   I came home from work yesterday, a Friday evening, to hear the familiar buzz and click noise that I had ignored the week before the frig broke two months ago.  I opened the freezer and everything was defrosting. I called a couple places and I was told I would have to wait until next week to have a new one delivered.  I called Brothers Main and Dave said he would see what he could do about getting a new one delivered the next day.  Dave, and the owner of the store were very helpful, no high pressure sales, just very interested in helping us out.  They even offered to give us a free loaner if the one we wanted was not in stock! The frig we ended up picking out was listed as having damage on it's side.  We saw nothing, but they offered a discount anyway.  The frig arrived this AM around 9:30.  They called half hour before they left the store to confirm and called again when on their way.  The delivery guys were very nice, and extremely careful.  I was happy to see that they used sound ergonomic lifting techniques too.  The new frig is up and running, looks great, and our food did not have a chance to rot.  Thank you Brothers Main, we'll be back when our next appliance kicks the bucket."
1,"The good: Nice ambiance, friendly service. I was trying to find a good ramen place (so spoiled by Orenchi in the bay area... that's the golden standard). Walked in and saw some Asian people so thought it was a good sign. 

The bad: Ordered chicken karage and ramen - chicken karage looked straight outta the freezer section at your local supermarket! 

If you haven't had good chicken karage, it's fried (chicken, duh) with a batter similar to tempura (lighter than traditional American batters). Nope, this was your standard frozen, then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food. If I wanted frozen food, I would have just made it myself (no I wouldn't, that shit tastes terrible). 

The sauce was uninspiring, but hey, does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it? 

The ugly:  The ramen I ordered came out... and disappointment abounds. First, the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket. So... yeah, if I want supermarket food, I'll just go to the supermarket. Am I wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch? Oh but it's so hard to make noodles by hand/machine you say? THAT'S WHY I SPEND MONEY IN A RESTAURANT!!!!

What about the broth? The life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together ... well let's not get too excited because once again, it tastes more like powdered mix. 

Are we sensing a theme here? Lots of supermarket stuff, at a premium price. Sorry, that's not why I go to a restaurant.

So why did I even bother trying this place? Because Yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand, but good at least). This was really sub-par at best; the nicest servers or prettiest backdrop cannot make up for low-quality food. But I am a temporary tourist in Phoenix (4 months for work, normally in SF), so take my ran with a grain of salt. Maybe all that big city living has made me a (ramen) snob; YMMV"
5,"Such a great value! Drink, soup or salad, meal, AND dessert for one low price!! The atmosphere is unique (love the street car you can dine in) and the service is always on top of it plus the food is yummy. I would definitely suggest the Old Spaghetti Factory as a great place to eat in the Valley!!"
5,"This place is amazing!  I had the whitefish po-boy and ice tea.  My friends had biscuit sandwiches And a couple cocktails, rave reviews all around!"
5,"I've lived in the Phoenix area for eight years and have eaten at dozens of different Mexican places looking for the best food. Rosita's Place has consistently come out on top. Their refried beans are the best I've ever eaten. Let me say that again: their refried beans are the best I've ever eaten. I like their carne asada burrito and their green chili is also good. 

The building looks a little worn from the outside, but inside it's very clean and the service is always good. I wish they had other locations because it's a long drive from where I live in Chandler."
5,"$4 awesome bloody marys on weekends! And $4 bud drafts too. Tons of food, so do your health a favor and split a meal with someone else.

Cooper donates a lot back to our community. A friend of mine from college received a scholarship to Grand Canyon University funded by Alice Cooper. Support local! :)"
1,"Went here yesterday to see the drag show with my friend (and fellow transperson) Fenyx.

Cruisin had everything I would ever want out of a bar; seedy atmosphere, cheap drinks, a stage, friendly bartenders, and trannies, crossdressers, and drag queens as far as the eye could see. For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's. 

But alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.

While waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I went through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side. 

So he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him.

""Awwww, man, now you've locked us out,"" we say, playfully.

The DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with ""Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out"" before walking off with his cigarette.

""What the hell just happened?"" I ask.
""He thinks we're a straight couple."" 
I laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.

I tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar. 

I knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.

I'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.

Oh well. Torrid and Guitar Center seem to do just fine without my business. I'm sure Cruisin 7th will do just fine."
1,"This place has gone down hill.  I have been here over the past few years and until today have had decent experiences.  I showed up to my appointment 10 minutes early and was required to fill out paperwork (is there a reason they don't keep a file for me?) but again, I was early so whatever.  I was done in 5 minutes but had to sit and listen to front desk staff discussing personal issues (babysitters' schedule, going to lunch, making fun of a poor lady who called for directions to the office two times, etc) until finally heading to the back around 9:20.  While waiting I couldn't help to notice that the place is dirty - trash on the floor,etc.
I go to the first round of tests and Megan (I think that was her name) the tech was awesome.  Except when she had me remove my contacts in their bathroom --- to spare you I will just say that it was more of a mess than the waiting room.
The dr exam was also pleasant and quick.  My current contacts were discontinued so she recommended a new brand and even gave me a sample set to wear home with my new prescription.
I went upfront to pay and was expecting my $20 co-pay as in years' past.  They charge me $60.  So of course I asked why and it was explained to me that this year they had given me a contact exam so that's why the additional charge.  What the?!  I've worn/renewed contacts for 4 years and have always gotten my exam from them.  In my opinion nothing has changed but I had no choice but to pay, obviously.  I called my insurance immediately to see if there was something that had changed with the plan and the agent said no and then asked if I order contacts through Nationwide or elsewhere.  I always do my exam at Nationwide where my exam is covered by medical insurance and order contacts/glasses at another place where my actual vision insurance is accepted.  Here's the kicker-- because there was no change, the insurance agent thinks Nationwide is charging more because I mentioned I wouldn't order though them.  Looking back, I'm not sure I was so honest in past years.  This makes me sick because I know I've been ""had"".
I should've run away from how dirty the place was anyhow because now I keep thinking about whether or not they sanitize anything that touched my face... *shudder*
On the up-side, this place is next to Wildflower for a good muffin & good cup of coffee."
5,"Absolutely best coffee in Madison, topped with a healthy serving of excellent service. Ambiance is perfect for studying (this is, in fact, my second home), hanging out with friends, reading a book by the fire, or conducting a business meeting. They have an excellent assortment of drinks (caffeinated and not) and food.
Skip the poor-tasting, cookie-cutter Starbucks and experience some real coffee made by people who actually take pride in their job... and check out the latte art before you put your lid on--they're getting good! :)"
5,"I took my car here to get my brakes replaced.  They did the work quickly and at a good price.  I went here on a recommendation from a friend, and now I recommend it to my friends when they need work done."
5,"Note to guys everywhere: Olbrich is a great place to take a date!  You get to walk around in semi-secluded areas and look at beautiful things.  It's romantic without even trying.

I love seeing how both the outdoor gardens and indoor conservatory flowers change at different times of the year.  Plus, the conservatory is so nice and warm during the winter!"
1,The hostess tatiana was extremely rude. She laughed at my coworkers name. Never had i seen or heard of such blatant disrespect from someone in the food industry. Obviously the managers need to be more careful if they want to start hiring residents of the nearby ghetto. I got sick afterwards but since my coworker didn't I won't blame ihop. One star for not getting me sick . Minus four stars for service.
1,"Tried it again ONLY because some friends were having a special occasion for an early-ish dinner.

One would think that the owners would at least LOOK at the reviews. Would address some of the issues but it never fails to amaze me that time and time again they have all the same issues and all the same problems. 

This time the staff behind the counter in what I imagine barely passes as a kitchen, were so loud, rude and inappropriate that we could hear their banter and loud voices in the dining area. 

Is there no manager!?!

I didn't think it was possible that the food could possibly get worse but it has. The upside is the calamari wasn't quite as rubber-like this time. On the downside, the service still was HORRIBLE in every way.

So, no good news here. Avoid."
1,"Holy wow what terrible service!  I came into to purchase display items and ask one simple question which was met with not only rudeness but downright aggression. I have been to Lonnie's before, and knew that customer service isn't exactly their forte, but after today's experience, I would drive to the other side of town to specifically NOT give them my business."
1,"We were in town for some sunshine, and we were excited to check out the breweries around.  Went to Four Peaks and Papago and were very pleased with the service, food, and beer.  We hit up Sun Up the following day hoping for an equally pleasurable experience.  That couldn't have been further from reality...

We got a sampler of their 6 regular brews as well as a sample of their 2 seasonals.  We had to choke down almost every one of them (the exception was their seasonal amber, which wasn't too bad but not worth ordering more than 4 oz of).  The waitstaff was not very friendly at all and seemed miffed that we didn't want food or more beer.  After chugging what beer I could and having a glass of water, I hit the restroom before leaving.  Wow.  Big mistake.  It smelled like an outhouse in there-- the ""poo fermenting in the middle of summer but you've had to pee so bad after a 4 hour hike so you'll go anyway but hold your breath"" kind of outhouse. Ick :P

Perhaps I am biased because we are from Fort Collins and are spoiled with the likes of New Belgium, O'Dells, and Equinox all within a couple miles of our house.  However, the service and stinky bathrooms were bad enough that had their beer been phenomenal, I still would have just given this place 3 stars...maybe.

If you're looking for good local beer, hit up Papago or Four Peaks instead and save your money (and beer belly) for something tastier!"
1,"I have recently visited the polo outlet with my girlfriend. We decided to make a trip up there because we love the deals, and I am usually a huge polo enthusiest. I was wearing my street clothes, and my girlfriend was too, and when we walked in we were not greeted with anything but disgust. 
As soon as we walked in, we split in different directions as the genders are divided, and started brousing. As soon as I walked to the sweater section, I was greeted with a very judgemental ""Can I help you?"" When I replied that i was just looking, he mentioned something on his head piece and three other employees started to walk near me. Wherever I went, these four men would follow me.
 I may not have been the uptight retired golf enthusiast they are used to seeing, but I am deffinately no thief either. It was very apparent that they thought this however, as whenever I looked at anything, they would look at eachother with dissaproving eyes, and no intention of helping me in the slightest.
 I understand that at my age, I may not seem like the type to blow a wad here, but i was in the market for a new sweater. Had I not been greeted with disgust and dissaproval, I would have purchased something. If you are looking for poor customer service, and a judgemental environment at a discount rate, this outlett is for you."
1,This location is terrible. Save yourself a headache and go a mile down the road to the UPS store on 44th and Oak. I bought a box to ship my laptop in and they said I had to go put it together in the parking lot even though I bought it and was shipping it at their store.
5,"As I mentioned before, I am very stingy when it comes to giving five star reviews. An experience has to be pretty mind blowing for me to do so. That being said, my experience at Cheuvront tonight was definitely worthy.

Our server, Drew, was absolutely wonderful. He was friendly, charming, and not hard to look at. He made us laugh and made sure our meal was perfection. He provided some of the best service I have received period, which is a lot to say because I go out to eat frequently. I will definitely be returning and bringing my friends and requesting him.

The food was just as great as the service. We went for restaurant week, so we each did the $30 dealio that comes with three courses. I did the poached pear salad, salmon, and the peach cheesecake. We also decided to try their mac and cheese because we had heard good things about it. The mac and cheese (we got the pesto and spinach one) was TO DIE FOR. I am salivating just thinking about it. I love me some mac and cheese so I am always excited to find really good ones. They also had a couple other options to choose from that I definitely will be back to try. My salmon was cooked to absolute perfection. The cheesecake was also amazing. 

My girls and I left totally stuffed but totally happy.

My only issue with this place was the bathroom. It was a little odd, but hey it had a toilet so I can't really complain.

They have a parking lot and they are also right off the light rail so they are super accessible. 

I'd definitely recommend this place for a date or a girl's night. It definitely has a romantic, luxe feel. I will definitely be back!"
1,"Scheduled an appointment by phone on a Monday for Wednesday @ 4:30pm. Showed up 10 mins early told gentlemen I had an appointment, they said have a seat. Waited with others 20 mins past my appointment, another gentlemen was sat before me with an appt. I let them know mine was 20 mins ago. Guy looks me up. ""No, you're not in the system. I can book you for tomorrow,"".... The place was a mess, not picking up between customers, hair on floor, and the customer service was horrible so at that point I just left. I was going to get the whole deal for $70 and planned on making this my new spot. Guess not. Hopefully the other V's in the valley have a higher company standard than this one. Called the other chandler location immediately after leaving here and got a friendly older gentlemen who booked my appointment and even gave me the name of my barber for when I arrive. That's actual customer service!"
1,"I've been a resident of this ""beautiful"" community for three years.  Three years too many.  I have dealt with several unbecoming situations in this complex including a used condom taped to my door, a combative leasing staff, being walked in on naked by contractors this company has hired.  Dirty grounds over run with stray cats and cigarette butts.  Save yourself the application fee and RUN!!!  This place is horrible and I can't wait until my lease is up so I can be done with this living hell.  I have been startled awake many times in the night having to call the police due to domestic violence issues.  So much, so that the police dispatcher knows my voice!  Management gave a ""devil may care"" attitude regarding such a dangerous situation.  For your safety and health, DO NOT RENT HERE!  DO NOT MAKE THESE PEOPLE ANY RICHER!!!"
1,"If you have poached eggs on your menu and do not know how to poach an egg do NOT offer it as an option. I got the breakfast item with spinach, mornay sauce ,and poached eggs, only to receive hard boiled eggs. It completely ruined the dish and my want to ever come back. Not to mention that the food is always mediocre. Not happy and not coming back."
1,"Wish I could have wrote a better review about this place. The mechanic i spoke with Was a nice guy an i felt confident the work would be quick and easy. I had some repairs on my truck. I was expecting it to take a couple of days and was expecting to spend up to a grand. The work was done and the vehicle passed emissions. BUT, within a day of getting the vehicle back the check engine light came on and now my a/c does not work. I popped the hood to see about the battery (as it was suppose to be replaced, it was) and under the hood there were bolts sitting on the side by the battery. I have no idea if they belong to my vehicle. There was also a rag tucked on the other side of the hood. The plastic cover on my neg. battery cable was sitting by the valve cover instead of being put back on or discarded. And the wiring harness which was accessed during the repair was not rewrapped and the wire that was worked on was completely exposed. I wanted to take the truck back but I was pretty soured on the lack of care for the work that was done. I will keep looking for a mechanic that gives me more bang for my buck."
5,"love this place, in every way!"
5,"Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The Food was Great, my fiance had a welcome burger and the just custom made me a breakfast burger. The chef came in and made a burger he had just created and gave us a taste. Would totally drive down from LA again for another bite"
5,"This was our first time trying Smokey Jons.  It is a new favorite for sure.  The space was small but cozy, and the food definitely deserves best in Madison (or the universe).  Patanne (the lovely lady who took our order) was friendly and made us feel right at home.  We will be back."
1,"""Been there - done that"", with this discrepant racket.  Besides the mediocre wash jobs - the customer service, in a blatant word - SUCKS.  First, they threw out my clothes that were slated to be taken to the dry cleaners.  That car washing cost me nearly $300.  I boycotted the place after the owners claimed no responsiblity.  

Then, in a desperate moment over a year later - I had an oil change and a wash just before leaving town on a Sunday morning road trip - nothing else was open.  I was told that the transmission fluid was low and it needed to be filled.  Halfway up the hill on I-17 North there was  pinkish crap blowing out of the tail pipe all over the back of the SUV and the idiot light on the dash indicated trouble.  The diagnosis given to me by the car repairman enroute was the transmission fluid had been over filled.  Nice.  Of course, Danny's Car Wash was not responsible.  I now done with them - figuring I got off lucky with the vehicle still in tact.  

But, you'd think I was from East Texas - the third time is really the charm.  The car was ""For Sale"" and I had painted this fact on the outside of the back windows in water soluble paint.  In my final heinous act - I ran it thru this car wash, calling attention to the windows to the incipient attendant.  He assured me it was ""No problem.  We'll get you all taken care of.""  The car wash complete and not outside my realm of expectation.  It was rendered to me with remnants of paint still plainly on the windows and the attendent present shrugged his shoulders.  When I pressed the issue, he suggested I to speak to the manager.  The rudimentary attendant was no where to be found.  The manager appeared.  Cut to the chase - they didn't even try to reclean the windows.  In the final scene I was driving out of the lot with dirty windows and the entire outside staff flagrantly geering and laughing!   

I know... sounds like the dumb chick in the horror film - but I think it's safe to say - that was the last time I left tracks in that driveway.  If I could deduct stars from this business, I'd give them MINUS - 5 stars.  There's my experience and opinion of Danny's Family Calamity Car Wash.
  
Check out Quick n Clean on 16th Street and Colter - Fabulous!  Inexpensive.  Excellent customer service!"
1,"We went to this store at 8 pm they close at 10pm they were out of dark meat in crispy, they had no mac and cheese made.  they did let us get some extra chicken because we wanted three sides of mac and cheese.  The people who woked here tried very hard but just didnt seem to know what was going on.  We went in for two 10 peice buckets and it took us more then a half hour to get what we needed..  this is the second time we had been there and the service was terrible both times."
1,"I finaly fell for the trap of Cooperstown! I heard from multiple people that Cooperstown was the greatest, Not only am i embarrassed that i went there i will never go back!.......To Start off we waited for about 20 minutes for our table which is reasonable , but when we sat down we didn't see our waiter for about another 10 minutes! I know it is a sports bar and it is going to be noisy but this was just unreal! The T.V.'s where turned up so loud that we couldn't talk to each other at our own table! After trying we resulted to just sitting there watching the T.V.'s without talking to each other! We even asked a worker if they could turn down the Sound just a little bit and they said it could not be done! I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and it was one of the worst i have ever had! It honestly tasted like school cafeteria food! The fries where some of the worst i have had! i do not know how you can mess up french fries but they easily managed that! Then in the end i had to pay for all that! I will never go back! Dont fall for the Trap like me!"
1,"I frequented this establishment years ago, however the quality began to lapse so I moved on. I picked up a groupon a few weeks ago to give them another try.  Well even at the discount it was not worth it.  The service is still lackluster, the quality of the work leaves much to be desired.  I won't be coming back anytime soon."
5,"OK, this time we saw, ""A Conversation with Edith Head."" - WOW! Great story, great set, great performance. This is a must see for classic movie buffs. Lots of great behind the scenes tidbits. Susan Claassen was fantastic..."
5,"They have It all :) Moved into the neighborhood a month ago and from water refills, to old fashioned fuses (guest house still uses them)  sandwiches and Spicy Dill Pickles.. Yum.. everything you can think of and the nicest Employees..  Coronado is lucky to have Sunshine Market.   Love this place :)"
1,"If I could, I would not even give the food 1 star. My wife and I both got sick from the
 food! We both had the runs after eating a green chili double burger and a fish sandwich. I would not recommend this place to anyone!"
5,"This place is overall fantastic. There is a hip diner atmosphere, the servers are always very attentive, and there are so many options for food!

There are several vegetarian and vegan options, for both breakfast and lunch/dinner. If you are (or aren't!) a vegetarian, try the Vegetarian Hash or the Meatless Loaf of the Gods. Both are insanely tasty and huge!"
1,"This place really sucks I went in there to rent equipment and the staff acted like they didnt want to help anyone out. I mean I know working sucks, but come on it's your job. So I give this place one star for the staff being rude, and the fact that i had to go to the Ski Pro in Mesa to rent the clothes that fit me. In the end I wish I had rented everything from the Ski Pro in Mesa. Mesa Ski Pro is a lot more polite and will be more than willing to help you find what you need."
5,"Went in today for a quick brake adjustment and to fix a ripped tube and despite being VERY busy I was in and out in under 45 minutes. I've been going to this bike shop for 5 years and I only had one bad experience (with someone who appears to be no longer employed by the shop). Everyone who works here is incredibly helpful and they will never push you to buy any services or products that they don't think you need or that they don't think are good quality. They are super woman friendly, despite being staffed by mostly men, and offer their space on some nights for a women's bike mechanics class (that I've heard of and seen, but never gone to). They built my 3-speed bike from scratch when I first moved here, gave me an excellent price for it, and have helped me to keep it well-maintained. I have had only minor problems with the bike and I put it through a lot of hell. I recommend this shop not just for repairs, but especially for anyone looking to get a well-priced custom bike."
5,Soups are wowzy spicy and the presentation is cool.  Pad Thai is as good as it gets.  Also the the Dragon appetizer.
1,"Worst. Service. Ever.

Have been there twice this year - what a mistake to go back!  First time we went for Challenge Nation - an event C&W was hosting registration for that was almost 1,000 people I think.  Guess how many people were working? TWO.  They even had someone who was participating in the event eating/drinking before who USED to work at C&W help out because they were so swamped.  Bad staffing doesn't even begin to cover it....

Decided to try it again before a concert at US Air and give them the benefit of the doubt that it was a huge event that most restaurants would probably struggle accomodating.  We had to wait 10 minutes for water (which is just a delight after walking in 110 degree weather), then the waiter said he'd be right back and promptly went to every other table in our vicinity except ours until we had to flag him down to put in drink orders.  The service the remainder of the time was mediocre at best.  Had to order some drinks at the bar because we never were able to find our waiter for new beers or water refills.

Wrote a review on Southwest's Rapid Rewards Dining site and got contacted by the manager apologizing for the bad experiences.  I thought - WOW, that is not consistent with the service received at all - what a great way to step up and take ownership of your restaurant.  He asked me to email him about my experience and that he would send a gift card to return so they could make it up and try to ""switch me back.""  

I emailed him - that was a month ago - no response received at all!!!!

I used to eat there years ago when working downtown - no complaints then - but whoever is running the show now needs to get it together!  Future diners - good luck!"
5,"Great authentic Hong Kong food.  I don't like all of the food they serve, but the stuff I order is the exceptional.  This is one of those ""hole in the wall"" places with great food. I highly recommend the Chow Fun, the Hunan Beef, ginger and green onion snapper (fried)...

This is one of my favorite spots."
1,"We have ordered a cab 50 minutes in advance. They knew we needed to go to the airport and even asked about our departture time. When it was 5 minutes past the agreed cab time, I called them to ask what's going on, and was told (without any apology!) that the cab is still 8 miles away! I was shocked, asked whether there is anyone closer (""no""), whether we would get a discount (""we do not give discounts""). Waited for the supposed cab for another 10 minutes and ended up taking our own car (the agent on the phone even said ""if you want guarantees you need to use your own car'!). Have not seen the cab anywhere in the area when was leaving, so it was AT LEAST 20 MINUTES LATE. Plus they never actually called me when the cab arrived. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY!"
1,Walked in on Saturday and walked out.
5,"Arguably the best thing about Madison. Real. Legit. Not Playing. Close your eyes, bite into the shrimp etouffee, and you feel like the gulf is close."
1,"Car was broken into.  Found out this is a regular occurrence.  When I spoke with the General Manager I was told too bad, they aren't responsible.  No security on property and according to Phoenix PD this happens frequently.  I'm out over $500.00."
5,"My first ever trip to Woody-Anne's involved a lady at the bar a) showing off a pic that proved ghosts exist cuz of an ""orb"" that is inexplicably present(?), b) flashing me her boobs for a drink that she never actually took me up on, and c) giving me an epicly gross (DRIPPING) wet willy, all in the span of Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide"" which soundtracked the whole experience.

The evening ended with me and the bartender watching a M.A.S.H. rerun in what was by then an otherwise empty bar.

Needless to say, this is my New Favorite Place."
5,"Tasting the chicken enchiladas and Enchiladas de Camaron (green chile & tomatillo shrimp enchiladas) made us ask, after decades of tasting enchiladas at dozens of other good restaurants, so THIS is what they're supposed to taste like?! Don't miss the mango-lime margarita. It's all magnificent, and highly recommended."
5,"A great little place to see shows, very small, very intimate, a great setting for seeing a band. If a band you want to see is playing here, be sure to go, it doesn't get anymore up close and personal than this.
There is no seating or alcohol, so if you don't mind standing and being sober, it is well worth it.
The art here is some of First Friday's best, as far as I am concerned, leagues above all the other galleries. Be sure to stop and see the art here if you are out then."
5,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Best of Philly yet... I've been coming here for ten years now and the food is always consistent, tasty and cheap.  Yes, the cheesesteaks are delicious, but you HAVE to try their gyros. AMAZING. Just remember your number if you call in for takeout...they don't take your name. Bombsteak!"
1,"wow. horrible experience here.  ""Tina"" the bartender, rude, confrontational, a little bit scary.  sad, since we've been coming here for karaoke a lot recently, and its always been great,  until tonight.  we will be reversing the charges on our card and never returning."
5,"Dropped-by for a quick drink on 1/30/14 at around 8:30pm.

+ Super cool dive bar that isn't really a dive bar
+ Very cozy inside, but in a really good way - feels ""homey"" and comfy
+ Awesome decor - the fixtures, the wood walls, the tin ceiling, the tables/chairs
+ Attention to detail like none other; little things make the whole (and they make it great)
+ Even the bathrooms are excellent

+ It's like the tap list was made just for me
+ Two nitro brews on tap, IPAs, Karben4, Upland - a really great mix
+ Super reasonable prices - $4 for excellent pints? Here's a $20; pry me off the floor when I'm done

+ Waitstaff was very responsive, very prompt, and super friendly

- So noisy; sound really carries in the place
+ It's a bar - it's supposed to be noisy, so deal with it, old man Steve


Grabbed a small table near the back/side wall. Ben, the owner, introduced himself and was so welcoming, gracious, and sincere. He's done an amazing job with this place and I'm confident it's going to be a smashing success. I love that it's just a few blocks from my house, because I know I'm going to be here often. Can't wait to try the food - the menu sounds and looks like a perfect match to the neighborhood, while honoring the spirit of the joint.

Would I go here with a date or someone that I wanted to have a good, solid conversation with? Probably not - it's just a little too noisy for that. But for any and every other occasion? Absofreakinglutely. Very, very cool place."
1,"I stayed here for a conference. My diamond stud earrings went missing from the time my husband checked out to the time the room was cleaned. (He had seen them and forgot to grab them.) Estimated time of two hours in which the earrings were left unattended.
He texted me when I was in the conference when he remembered seeing the earrings and notified security. The security person was cooperative and searched to no avail.
I sat in the lobby for the Phoenix police. I asked for a comment card. I was told a survey would be emailed to me.  No one from management met me. I am told that the employees are longstanding and have a lot to lose meaning their job if they stole the earrings. I asked if they polygraph employees. It is the police's decision apparently.
My biggest disappointment is that no one from the staff reached out. At least four employees knew of my situation, did not say my name or offer a sentence stating they were sorry about the situation. It was though I was the problem although I had not accused anyone of anything. I have to file a report for insurance. 
One star goes to the security officer. He was professional, sensitive and empathetic to my situation."
5,"I love these guys!! They always have great recommendations and good quality food. They are my go-to meat market, even now that I live outside of Madison. They are super friendly, too, and helped me carry stuff out to my car when I was with my baby. GREAT STORE!!"
5,"Awesome tortilleria and fun to watch with the kidlets.  Fresh salsas, frescas, bakery items, meats, and cheeses.  Restaurant/cafeteria inside is tasty and you can make your food exactly how you want it (bean and cactus burrito!!).  We go here at least once a week to grab our non-organic stuff...kiwis, papayas, mangos, etc. and the tortillas...because they are gigantic!  Our bill's never been over $40 for four big bags of produce!"
5,"I must say I rather like this place, even though I wish they took credit cards. Great pastries and tea, as well as good veggie breakfast options. Not the fastest service but worth the wait."
1,"Read about Tom's, was intriqued by both the history and new ownership.  The staff is friendly, the decor is nice (if a bit too bright for a tavern).  However, the food and service are lacking.  Ordered a cheese burger medium rare with no bun and a fried egg; delivered a raw burger with a bun and no egg.  When the food was returned to be cooked - received a terse comment about ordering a medium rare burger - do we want it medium.  Actually, I would have rather enjoyed a medium rare burger without the added commentary.  
The caesar salad warm warm and wilted.
We will not be back; my wife and I enjoy the resurgence of the downtown area - but next time I want a burger it will be 5Guys right across the street."
1,"There's about 10 minutes of things  I like about Roscoe's:  It's a good place to go for darts and a beer, and the music is above average before it gets worse.   With that, I'm already out of things I like, so I suggest you spend no more than that here and leave.   

I only went to meet friends, and a good friend at that.  I would have passed any other time.   

I order a Stella on draught, served right, even in the Stella glass.  They do know how to serve beer and other alcoholic drinks here, like, in the strictest sense of being able to pour a non-skunked brew or a strong cocktail in the right glass.   Not much else, unfortunately.

$4.75, the bartender tells me.  I hand him my Visa.  

""It's cash only.""   

My vision blurs as I strain to quell my irritation as we're already off to a great start.  I should have left right there, but that would have probably been illegal and the Stella looked pretty good.  

I take out a $20 from the ATM, the last ATM in Arizona that still dials out. So I spent my time waiting looking for skimmers because nobody else would have noticed one in a place this cheap.   

I like paying $5 in fees for a $5.75 beer.   I really do.   (With tip, as its not his fault his job sucks.)

As I find out, I pulled the last $20 out of the ATM before it *ran out of money.*  If I intended on pulling more out to lessen the 25% tax on my cash, I would've been doubly irritated.  

So when the bartender switches the policy from ""cash only"" to ""we take plastic"" after I just went out of my way and money to comply...I didn't know there was another reason I don't want to go back but the morons who run this place figured one out.  

The stale-beer-and-sweat smell was getting to me by the time my friend needed a cigarette.   But forget seeking your respite on their ""patio.""    

Their ""patio"" is more like a planemullkip, a word I had to just make up from the German translation for ""a tarp stretched over a garbage dump.""  

No prior English word better describes this pathetic joke--It smells worse outside, there's no furniture, but there is plenty of garbage and you can't even take your drink out.

Maybe it's intentional--they've duplicated being just as cheap, annoying, and lazy on the outside as they have inside.   The tiny bathroom that forces everyone to watch you take a dump is just like the rest of the place:  all the charm and appeal of a rural county lock-up, right down to the same suicide-proof sheet-metal toilet.  Even if you get off on this sort of thing despite the many inherent travesties, go elsewhere.  

Incidentally, I really like setting my coaster on top of my drink and adjusting it so just in case one of the creepy trolls here GHB's my drink, I'll notice.

A use permit is something like $500 from the city for outdoor alcohol  consumption, and they might pay that much in fencing.   Instead, I just I don't get it.  I first went here 7 years ago and I can tell they've made about $300 in capital improvements since then, all from Goodwill.

Outside lives a $30 heater, they have a $150 website, and $100 for a used LCD or two.   One of the LCDs was displaying a completely different faded illegible picture than the one on the same channel next to it, putting the rampant cheapness here in striking contrast to the one new thing that worked--the jukebox probably wasn't theirs and didn't work either.   Who even knew you could get a website from Goodwill?

The last $20 they must have spent is for the annoying plastic flaps they hang on the back door to lessen their AC bills.
 
This place reeks of cheap.  And not in a good way like a cheap beer, the sort of thing I'll tolerate a lot for.  

Roscoe's is cheap like ""you've got to be kidding me"" cheap or ""the smell just made me throw up in my mouth"" cheap, both of which negate any benefit of cheap beer. 

Rocoe's survives on two things:  being the one gay sportsbar in town and being the one thing to do on a Tuesday night.   

So I give it a 2 out of 10.  It covers its bases, but that's it.   I'll say it a third time.

Even if you like that sort of thing, just go elsewhere."
5,"First of all, how has no one reviewed Michael's yet?  They have the best everything!  The best frozen yogurt, certainly the best fried cheese curds EVER, and the best root beer.  Michael's is open kind of later than you might expect, and has a nice patio to sit outside in the summer.  They now offer K-9 custard, so you can bring your dog too!  

My cat likes ice cream, I wonder if K-9 custard could be good for felines?"
1,"BEWARE!  Had a full detail done inside and out. Then go back about a month later for just a wash. The guy was annoyed that I wouldn't buy extra services (even though I explained it was all done the previous month) 

Left my car, went in to pay and wait on other side for my car. Since my car was second in line for the wash I thought it strange that I had seen a minimum of eight cars come out and mine not one of them. 

I walk back to the beginning to see what they did with my car and sure thing there were another four cars in front of it! 

They must have had to do a lot of car jockeying to get it behind the next dozen or so that came in after me.

When brought to their attention they totally don't care or listen to what is going on. Very defensive and unbelieving this could ever happen. 

As we all know (should know) what goes around comes around and Karma will get you every time. 

They made the headlines tonight.  They are being served warrants for search and arrest of many with the business by the FEDS. 

GOT TO LOVE IT !!!!!!!"
5,"They really knocked our food service out of the park. It was truly the most amazing food I've ever had at a wedding and being that it was my own, I was adamant about the quality being key. I don't want to diminish the fact that if I were at a restaurant and ate this food I would be extremely satisfied. 
I still keep receiving unprompted feedback stating that this was the best food my guests have EVER had at a wedding. Thanks for making my day so great and my guests' palates satiated!"
5,For a chain...Baja Fresh makes some really good Mexican food. Always fresh and delicious. My favorite is the Baja Burrito with grilled chicken. The side salad is a great deal...try the Salsa Verde dressing!  Enjoy!!!
5,"One of Middleton's hidden gems.  It's our favorite place to go for special occasions! Be sure to try the ""lasagna of the day"". It's always worth it."
5,"I thought I was in a bad dream last night, my sitter was late like I missed the first part kinda late. I was steaming mad grrrr when I got to the Box office it was already closed of course, because who would actually be that late for a show! After peeping thru the doors we were directed to the head honcho, he politely gave us our tickets and instead of us interrupting the people already seated he decided to put us in some empty balcony seats on the lower level. It was great! I never made it upstairs and mind you I was late but from what I saw and the staff being so helpful when I thought the night was totally ruined they get 5 star's from me!"
1,Worst service ever.
5,Great BBQ! Excellent customer service. Place is really busy at lunch time so prepare to stand in line.
5,"Not your ordinary diner food , but with a great twist on food and drinks.
A culinary find.  They use only the best and freshest local ingredients.
Daily salads are a work of art.  Great people serving great food."
5,"I use Union Cab multiple times a month for work. They are timely, helpful and nice. I will continue using them."
5,"This place is darling. The patio is gorgeous with lots of comfy, welcoming, and uplifting touches. The service is always upbeat, fun, and inviting and the food... holy moly. I'll gladly gain a few pounds for you Welcome Diner. 

If you want to go somewhere different, escape this silly life for a moment, and enjoy a delicious beverage I highly recommend you stroll over to this diner, order yourself a ""Hurricane"" and find a seat on the patio where you can relax while the desert sun sets. In fact, I just might head over there all by my onsies tonight. Yes, I'm going to drink alone. I'm ok with it. 

Everything I've ever ordered off their menu has been delicious. They have lots of southern food options and they change up their specials menu about once a week. Anything you order will be divine. I promise you. Don't question me, I have the pounds to prove it."
1,"Just found hair in the pizza. Eww! Never again from this location will I order food, blah!"
5,"Been eating here for years and it doesn't disappoint (well, sometimes). 

I mainly come for the menudo but I also come because of the prices, it's clean and quick service and I know that what I've ordered will be both filling and satisfying. 

One thing:  the salsas are HOT! I cannot eat them out the jar even after all this time. You've been warned:-)"
1,"I've been to this McDonald's twice, one month apart, and I've had the same experience twice.

The hash browns are gross. They taste like they've been fried in old, burned, rotted oil. This is the only McDonald's I've ever been to that's had foul tasting hash browns.

Both times I've sat inside and both times I've overheard the same bitching several times over... .the manager having to continually tell a male employee (not kidding around), ""stop being mean to the customers"" and ""be nice!"""
1,"I HAVE NEVER been to a more unprofessional place in my life! My Dr's MA, was loud and  obnoxious! She called my name and says "" come on honey, walk this way"" walked so fast I had no Idea where she even went then came out of a room and says "" I said this way!"" Then she starts talking to me about my health problems while we were still in the hall... I almost felt like she was on drugs... The Doctor finally came into the room.  He had the worst bedside manner I have ever seen! He did not want to hear any of my symptoms. He wanted to run all sorts of test... how did he now what i needed? He was suppose to be one of the "" top docs' at the institute...  When we were done, I went up to the front desk and a drak haired lady was on the phone and not once did she recognize that I was waiting for her!  I would never in a million years recommin this place to my works enemy!"
5,"They continue to impress me! I finally remembered to ask them at the end of the wash to take a sticker off my window that I had partially stuck there for 2+ years. They had me pull forward and used a little scraper and some cleaner and it came right off!

The only annoying thing is the guy who 'takes your order' always tries to up-sell. I'm pretty sure he works on commission though and usually doesn't push it when I tell him, ""No, no thank you- no underflush this time. I know you really think I need it and maybe I'll get it next time"""
1,"I recently went to the Arizona Science Center to see their special Van Gogh exhibition.  First, the price to see this special exhibit was exorbitant- $25.00 a person including general admission.  This DID NOT include any IMAX movies or the planetarium, which were each $8.00 extra.  And, the price did not include parking, which for me, ended up being another $5.00.  At the end of the day, I ended up paying $38.00 just for one person.

As far as the Van Gogh exhibit, the concept was interesting but unfortunately, the children in the other exhibit next door were so incredibly loud that you could  hear their screaming, which was louder than the music playing in the Van Gogh exhibit.  Additionally, a couple of women brought their children into this exhibit, which was quite clearly for adults, and the kids were noisy as well.

The Van Gogh exhibit was ok-I really do not know why this exhibit was at this museum as it did not relate to science and it was geared to adults- not kids like everything else at this museum.  The other exhibits might have been interesting but there were unruly children running around and screaming all over the place.

My last stop was to the planetarium-I saw the Grand Tour of the Planets.  This was god awful. There was a woman narrator who talked the entire time about the planets but again, her presentation was geared to little kids.  I felt like I was in kindergarden listening to her.

Maybe if you have little kids this museum is fine but it truly was an incredible rip off and not very enjoyable in my opinion."
1,"Too bad there's not an option for no stars. The only thing more atrocious than the fungal smell and lack of working equipment at this gym is the customer service. Today I cancelled my entire family's membership because I've had enough. After touring three other local gyms - I'm willing to pay the extra money to switch to one that gives a crap about its customers. Having had my membership for 11 years it's a sad move, especially since I pay peanuts - but it's just NOT worth the headache of working out here. When the manager accused me of lying about my child's age, I went back home and brought back her birth certificate to prove I wasn't lying, and still I remained a customer. When the manager bitched at me about not answering the overhead page when it CLEARLY states on the app (in permanent marker) that they MUST call me on my cellular because I am hard of hearing and I run plugged into my iPhone, I stayed a member. Now they're saying I haven't paid up my account even though I have a RECEIPT in my possession from last week, when I paid in person. If this is how they treat loyalty, I'd hate to see how they piss on everyone else. Take my advice - pay the extra few bucks and switch to Gold's, LA, or ANYWHERE else."
5,"I usually despise going to auto shops, but this was really a great experience!  I mostly understand what was wrong with my car instead of my usual clueless-ness.  The price seemed pretty reasonable too."
1,"Closed, as of this spring.  The replacement restaurant is not worth a visit (unless you are sleeping upstairs, you've driven all day, and cannot face another minute behind the wheel)."
5,"I love Harley's, but my liver hates it. Booze and Bait,what more do you want?"
5,"I've been to Cheuvronts over the years for lunch and afternoon wine and cheese pairings, and always had a good time.

But the real sleeper deal and meal is their weekend breakfast menu. I've been three times now, had their version of Eggs Benedict the first two and today, a wonderful Filet Medallion with 2 eggs, potatoes and fruit cup...with blueberry muffin. The Eggs Benedict is $9.50, today's meal was $12.00. All fresh and wonderful and the best part, no wait. You can dine on the patio or inside. When I think that folks are waiting at First Watch and Matt's Big Breakfast, while I just sail over to a table,  I pity those fools. 

It's not the cheapest breakfast in the Valley, but for the price it's certainly one of the best."
5,"Praise to a fallen giant, consumed by technology.

I have been a customer of Photomark in Phoenix for the past few years, dropping by to pick up/process some film and treat myself to an accessory or two when shooting in Arizona/Utah.   They have shut down both lab and camera shop as you can tell from the currently non-existent websites.
  
This shop and its knowledgeable staff will be missed by many."
1,"Rated ""10 best family restaurant chains"". Fine, two reasons to hate it."
1,"WoW,  one star! Those are very rare for me, but here's why. The place its still looks really good and feel about it. The waiters are ill-trained. I came here with a groupon/google offer. I've always wanted to see what it is all about. I am so thankful that I was only out a few bucks and didn't have to pay full price. They screwed up my bill and took FOREVER to fix. Had to get the manager, who was very nice but about as incompetent as the serving staff. The food is very bland, the customer service is NOT horrible, but as bland as the food. Good news, I got my bill fixed after having to get in the manager involved and after a really long wait. With so many places in the vicinity don't waste your time or your money."
5,"Let me just tell you... if buying a wig for an exciting night of Big Hair Bingo weren't enough the little Korean guy that runs this store is a hoot.

All of the famous (I use this term very loosely) drag queens in Phoenix buy their wigs from Panorama.  I spent a little more than I would have spent at a costume shop for my wig, but it is a high quality synthetic hair that will last a long time.

This is in what I would call an up and coming part of the city... be sure to stop by and support this great local biz."
1,"For the second time in two weeks I've sat at my table for 15 minutes before having to go to the bar to get a drink. Service has went downhill quickly. I should add that there are two cocktail servers and another two behind the bar this evening AND four to five open tables. No excuse for bad service, Roscoes! If you want guests to serve themselves you should tell them so."
1,"I was a member of Desert Schools for years and decided to change credit unions a few years back. The atmosphere was very unprofessional and unfriendly. A manager named Lisa Lowe (not sure of last name spelling) struck me as a snarky teenager that hated her employees. I witnessed her being disrespectful towards her tellers on multiple occasions. She dresses inappropriately for a banking environment. And she doesn't seem to know how to properly speak to members, remaining diplomatic while explaining basic fees. I worked in a similar field for years and it's an important and essential skill to have, to be able to explain fee changes (or any changes) to the member while still remaining friendly and staying loyal to your company. Lisa really seemed to struggle with this, and just came off as uninformed and annoyed."
1,"I took my cat for a nail trim and I showed her the best way to hold her.  The nurse while holding her told me off saying that if there were dogs there that would not be safe for the staff.  There were no pets there but with her holding my cat I said nothing.  She took my cat back to the room and I heard her meowing sort of normal but then I heard her screaming which is very unusual for her so I ran back there and saw one tech on the phone and the nurse with a towel over my cat.  My cat did not know I was there but the nurse said that I was upsetting my cat.  Again, I said nothing because my cat was in her care.  Dr. Cruz came was behind me and intervened so I felt more comfortable.  One male asst came back and told me that it was normal for a cat to act that way.  Then Dr. Cruz came and told me about cats meowing when they get a nail trim.  I have had my cat's nails trimmed for years and I know her normal meow but not screaming plus I saw the jar of stuff they use when they cut nails too short.  What I think happened was they cut her nails way too short and hurt her thus her screaming meows.  I am so upset that I subjected my cat in this manner.  Never again will I go there!"
1,"I wish that this Joann's would get a management overhaul. The store is always dirty, the fabric is in shambles, and the shelves are constantly under-stocked and unorganized. I believe this is a direct management issue because the staff work hard, there are just never enough of them on the floor.
As it has been pointed out in previous reviews, there isn't competition for business on the eastside, so the store continues to be in business while providing a poor environment for staff and customers. Clean it up, guys! And get some more staff. You are working these ladies too hard and it's obvious that they don't have time to clean and organize the store."
5,Food was amazing!!! Just wish it were open on Sunday :)
5,"This place rocks!! Yes, it costs more than a Supercuts ($21 for a haircut), but seriously, it's your hair! Pamper yourself and pay the extra $5! You will be treated to a prompt, precise, barber haircut, straight razor trim (complete with the heated foam) hot towel, aftershave, shoulder massage, TVs, pool table?! Why wouldn't you? Try them today! Getting married? $45 The Works for you and your groomsman. (cigar included)"
5,"I love this place! I cannot believe it took me nearly five years to finally visit after moving to Wisconsin. This is a wonderful place! I love that it's free. I went because I wanted to seethe Thai Pavilion, while it was my favorite thing there, the rest of the gardens were very impressive. I would highly recommend it."
5,"Fabulous, just fabulous. Service is spectacular and food is beyond amazing. The wait was awhile, maybe half an hour or so but totally worth it. The breakfast burrito, salmon hash and potato and zucchini pancakes are delectable."
5,"I have visited Prairie Cafe several times and love it. The breakfast/lunch menu is varies from great egg dishes to tasty sandwiches and salads. Vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike will find somthing satisfying. Good selection of in-house, serve-yourself coffee. I tried the ""Health Shake,"" --sort of a cross between a shake and a smoothie. Very tasty and a perfect breakfast. Very comfortable atmosphere with free wireless. Seems to attract a ""usual"" crowd. Overall a very positive experience."
1,"About a month ago I had Checker replace the sand in my sand filter.  Immediately when he turned on the pump there were bubbles coming out of the return.  I said ""why are there bubbles coming out of the return.  I've never had bubbles coming out of the return?""  Mike just basically blew me off.   Bled it to get the air out and still have bubbles.  Had their tech guy out and he was just plain rude.  I told him to humor me and check the O ring on the filter lid because I never had bubbles coming of the return and the only thing that has changed is they changed the sand.  The guy didn't want to do it and didn't do it and preceded to tell me how he gets paid.  Bottom line, he just wouldn't get paid enough to check the O ring and heaven forbid he had to replace it.  I've never dealt with a company that won't do something you have asked."
5,"I don't know much about cars but I do know that the people who work at Virginia Auto really care about their customers. Matt, especially, has gone above and beyond what was expected to help me out.

Last week my car broke down on the side of the road in Austin, TX, and I had no one to help me. The road side assistance card I was given during my Groupon I had used a few months prior was expired and I had forgotten to get a new one. I called Matt and he stayed on the phone with me for over an hour trying to get a hold of someone to come and pick me up. He eventually found a truck to get me, free of charge, and then sent me the new road side assistance card the next day. 

He knew that I was living in Austin and would probably never bring my car back to his shop for repairs but he still did everything he could to help me out. Anyone who would do that for a customer will always get my business and I letting my friends in Phoenix know about his great shop. 

Thanks Matt! Keep up the great work."
1,"The only thing less fresh than their 1980's decor was the food on their buffet.

Walk in and you will be greeted by an eccentric person in a leisure suit, you can either go in the glass doors with acrylic handles or in to the mirrored room with zebra booth and old conference table chairs. No this is not a gentlemen's club it is a a restaurant that just lacks windows. 

For Mother's day they had a buffet only setup, and what mom does not love cold food that has been sitting out for an undetermined  amount of time. The croutons in the Cesar salad were soggy as were the crustinni under the bruchetta. The pasta was cool. Even worse the butter soaked farm raised salmon cubes were just luke warm. The vegetables were mush and again just luke warm. The mozzarella in the caprese on the buffet was not made in house as it was firm and flavorless. 


The real amusing part was on the dessert section. There was a plate of items straight from Costco, lemon bites, cookies and cinnamon twists just as you would by at Costo, on a plate and picked over.  

This is one relic that is better left in the past, horribly dated decor, sub par food at high prices means this place should be avoided."
1,Closed as of 2/17
5,"This place is amazing! The food is great but when grandma blue fin comes by to refill you're drink or even your entree, you'll understand  why we all love it!"
5,"They will forever be my favorite place to eat when I'm wanting pasta!
Let's start with the bread. It's alway fresh and the butter is easy to spread
Then the salad is great with the pesto ranch yummmm! 
Every pasta I have gotten I've never been disappointed with. My favorite is the mizithra cheese on one side and meat sauce on the other. AMAZING!"
5,"This place was uber cool. I grew up 10 mins from the Mexican border so I was fortunate to grow up with authentic Mexican food- from restaurants and taco stands to my friends Nana making homemade tortillas and rice and beans and well, everything. 

We were in the mood for carne asada tacos to grill at home and decided to buy some meat here instead of food city or the carneceria up the street. I heard about the hype and great reviews but never got around to checking it out. 

This place rocks! 100% authentic and has everything I need to make virtually any Mexican dish I can remember. 

The place is so cool. I can't get over it. Bakery, deli, tortilla factory, cheeses, meats, seafood, veggies, spices and candy. It has it all. It's pretty much the Mexican version of Lee Lee's, only cooler looking and more fun. 

Check it out."
1,"Very disappointed--I have been receiving my haircuts from this establishment off and on for a couple of years.  When I came in today I requested a certain stylist. The manager told me it would be a 20 minute wait (in my opinion she was rude and unfriendly).  I sat in the waiting area watching people come and go for about 40 minutes.  Finally, I walked around the corner so I could see what the stylist I requested was doing.  I realized that she was cutting a person's hair that walked in about 35 minutes after I arrived.  The reason that I am upset is because the manager could see that I had been sitting and waiting for 40 minutes or so. Nobody even bothered to ask me if I was waiting for my appointment. I walked out and they definitely knew I was upset.  I gave them my phone number so we will see if they call and attempt to rectify their poor customer service."
5,"The people are really cool.  Excellent food made from local ingredients. The chicken biscuit sandwich is yummy. Also, must indulge in the poutine. Fun place with lots of misters running over the picnic tables outside which kept us cool. Must check this place out for yourself."
5,"Great little space. Go see the Christopher Jagmin show right now!!! His colorful, slightly loopy encaustic paintings are a great reminder that life is fun, dammit, and art can be too!"
5,"My friend and I just had a 10 minute text message conversation about how FREAKING GOOD this place is. A few things to know about me: I live downtown, I know good food, I DO NOT eat at Chili's... ever. When I say something is good, I mean handcrafted, fresh ingredients, bursting with legitimate flavor good. 

But enough about me. You want to know about Blue Fin, so here's the lowdown: 

- Super clean digs and friendly, wonderful personal service from the most adorable little ladies.
 
- Tender (non-bouncy) char-grilled teriyaki chicken thoroughly marinated in a not-too-sweet sauce that tastes slightly fermented (in the best way) with a touch of sesame. 

- Great steamed veggies that melt in your mouth served with perfectly cooked brown rice.

- Flavorful miso with generous chunks of tofu.

- Wonderful house made sauces. My favorite is the sweet and sour sauce, the kind they serve with spring rolls and dumplings, it's tangy and full of fresh ginger.

- Affordable prices, generous portions, and great for healthier mid-week dinner take-out if you can get there before 6:30.

Go!"
5,"I haven't been to Monty's in at least 15 years, so it was really nice to visit Madison and return to find it just as great as I remember.  Great atmosphere and excellent service.  Really excellent service. I had the Blackened Salmon Salad, which was great - I love that they have some healthy options.  My kids opted for pancakes, eggs and bacon - all good.  My husband, who usually comments on how expensive a meal outside McDonald's is, actually made a ""hey reasonable price"" sort of comment.  That's sayin' something for the value!"
1,"Note:  This review is location-sensitive.
I called the wrong location (Sun Prairie) when I needed delivery to east Madison. To THEIR credit, the girl there was incredibly nice and gave me the new number of the east side location. 

Rude employee, Bad food, Bad service. Will never order from them again.
However, when I called the Commercial Street location, a gentleman answered, with incredibly loud music in the background causing me to barely understand the questions I expected. He asked for the necessary delivery info and what I wanted. I asked him which would be easier for him, the numbers or titles of what I wanted (given that I looked online prior to calling) and he replied with 'whatever, no both'. I started my order and he corrected me rudely telling me I wasn't referring to the correct numbers, that they belonged to another store (there's only one website). After taking my order, he took my card number, said it would be 45 minutes, and hung up.
The delivery man was very cordial, however, the food was the worst Chinese I've ever had (Order: Crab Rangoon, Chicken Fried Rice, Pork Egg Roll, General Tso's Chicken) - the chicken and rice was dry, the general tso's was mostly fried dough, the crab rangoon had overpowering green onions and the fortune cookie stale.
I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
1,"I'll start  with the good--the actual unit themselves are very nice, especially compared to most of the complexes near the downtown area, and the prices were fair (I signed a lease in the summer of 2011 so I'm not sure what current rates are). We have the large 2 bedroom and it doesn't feel cramped like most apartments. The location is close to a light rail stop (Central & Indian School) and across the street from Steele Indian Park which holds a lot of great local events & even has a dog park. Great pools and the gym is ok. 

Now with the bad. The management here is completely unhelpful. They actually changed management a few months ago but from what I have experienced they are no more helpful than the last. 

The previous management never did an actual walk-through with us, just had us fill out the form and drop it off. They never gave us the key to our patio storage and we still do not have it (we tried 2-3 times to inquire and just gave up after that). They would take weeks to complete maintenance orders (simple or complicated), obviously a sign of bad management. It even took them months to get us copies of the gate keys.

Right as they switched over management there was for some reason a large pool of white paint in one of the parking garage spots. My toddler almost slipped in it, getting paint all over herself and I. I spoke to someone now under the new management and they said they would look into it. Who knows if they did. 

It seems they've tried to employ ""fun"" things with iliveheretoo.com and a meet & greet with management staff. I feel as though they should have improved their basic customer service and maintenance before even thinking about those things. They sent out a letter for Fourth of July stating that they would be providing security for our parking garage and to ensure no reserved spots would be taken by event attendees. The park holds a large fireworks event, so there is a lot of traffic. Well as we pull in we see the hired security and think ""Awesome!"" but we pull in to our space and there is someone in it! So I don't know what kind of process the management relayed to this hired security but it was obviously not thought through. The security let us know that they could tow, but we would need the tow card--which they ALSO NEVER GAVE US. They also promised the top floor of the garage would be reserved and blocked off for residents to bring chairs and watch the show. They didn't come through on that either. There were tons of cars parked and even more that were still trying to drive through the loads of pedestrians (including children) making it very dangerous. 

They scheduled the apartment above me to be turned over on an early Saturday morning with the banging and noise continuing well on into the afternoon. After calling in and asking why they would do this on a weekend the explanation was ""well if they don't do it today the people can't move in."" Which to my reaction is great, what about the people who pay and already live here?! You mean to tell me they couldn't schedule themselves correctly and move it 2 days to a Monday? Another mis-management of their maintenance scheduling. 

Other issues include overflowing garbage that's right inside the garage,  pigeon/cat/dog waste, big security gate breaks often (defeating the 'security') part. When it rains you can just smell all the dog and cat pee. I love animals--but they should really work on controlling this issue. They could probably benefit from working with a shelter or a trap-neuter-return organization for all the stray cats. They could also pay more attention to which residents are not cleaning up after their pets. There are several areas in the complex and in the garage as well that are caked with pigeon feces. 

I know this is long and I probably sounds like a grump, but just don't want anyone to be sold alone on the units aesthetics like I was. I think ""The Station"" just down the street might be owned by the same company? I've been there and its SO much cleaner and nice--but I think that's because they cater to a higher price point, sadly.

Also--I had ignored the bad reviews I found online of this place, big mistake."
1,No carry out on Friday nights!?!  I'm new to the area and was looking to trying Dexters Friday fish fry after hearing so many great reviews. Unfortunately I didn't get the chance as they do not provide a carry out option on Friday nights. I was speechless went told this over the phone!  I did try another place (Brothers Three) that was happy to provide carry out to this customer and it was wonderful!
5,"I haven't been to many convention facilities, but the Phoenix Convention Center (formerly the Phoenix Civic Plaza, which was a dumb name, btw) really shines.   Compared to the LA Convention Center, this place is outstanding.

Over the past few weeks I have been to events, meetings and banquets in the South Ballroom and West Hall.  The West Hall looks clean, modern, and is impressive with a gigantic atrium entrance on 2nd St. and seemingly endless escalators up to the third floor.  

Audio visual equipment here is top-notch and they spare no expense with the A/C - holy crap it was FREEZING!  Signage for the restrooms could be more helpful as I found myself guessing where the loo was each time.

I'm not sure who does the catering here, but I found the food to be above average, but not outstanding.  Think ordinary salads (chicken cobb and a southwestern caesar), your typical rubber chicken banquet meals, a breakfast buffet of eggs, bacon, Starbucks coffee etc.   For dessert we had some kind of cheesecake turnover sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar - yum. 

If you go in the near future - definitely check out the ongoing construction. The top floor of the West Hall boasts an impressive view of the North and East expansions where you can see all the cranes and construction going on and more detail than you can imagine."
1,"I have been in this shop twice. The first time I came in, I was quoted a certain price to take parts off my old bike and transfer them all to my new bike. Obviously the quote didn't include if parts didn't fit or if I needed new parts. I had called originally and was quoted a price to do this. When I came into the shop, Eric told me that he wasn't going to do it for that price and it didn't matter what his employees quoted me over the phone. He wasn't willing to help at all and his quote was almost double what I was told over the phone. 

The second time I came into this shop was because I needed my fox rear shop sent in for warranty work. I gave him the shock and it was sent in to fox. I was told there would be a 10 day turn around to get it fixed and back at the shop ready for pickup. Fox called the shop and told them my shock was no longer available. I was originally told that it would cost $100 to get it fixed with the warranty through fox. After fox called the shop and told them they didn't have my shock any more, the price went up to $160. I was ok with that considering what a new one costs retail. For some reason when fox called the store, they didn't call fox back and tell them it was ok to fix it and send it to them at them price. One of the employees of the pig even admitted they dropped the ball and would call fox right away and get this resolved. It took 4 weeks from when I dropped the shock off until it got back to the bike shop. When I went in to pick up the shock and pay for it, it now cost $195. Eric again was not willing to help. He told me, "" I'm not going to lose money on this."" I asked if there was anything he would do for his employees dropping the ball and not returning calls and making this whole process takes weeks longer. He said he would be more than happy to show me the invoice for the shock from fox but that he wasn't going to discount it at all and again told me that he wasn't going to lose money. Needless to say, I will never be going back to this shop again. I have never been talked to or treated this way by the owner of the company and have never had it happen twice and those two times being the only two times I have ever been in his shop. Be careful when you go into this shop and get any work needed put on an invoice and get a copy of it before you get anything done. I am very disappointed and will spread the word about this terrible bike shop."
1,"This place charges a cover charge?! We should be paid to come in there! It's in a horrible place in town, drinks or retardedly over priced & the parking is ridiculous. The inside of the club only smells more worse then the urinal because the little tiny room they call a bathroom is 2x2! You can't pay me to come back there. I wish I had known how horrible this place was before I got suckered into going & basically throwing away my money."
5,"Showed up for a tour, but they had already finished for the day. Still one of the guys took us on a private tour. Started off with a free beer, had the Octoberfest. Very good beer. The guy was very informative and showed us the whole place. Answered some questions we had about beer also."
5,"We go here religiously whenever we are craving Chinese take-out (which happens a lot!) I could imagine this place is overlooked but it seriously has some of the best food in town. Service is fast and the food comes out consistently great every time. Order the pork fried rice, you won't regret it."
1,The best way to waste your money: 13$ and your car is just enough cleaned outside and not vacuumed inside at all. 1h waiting. Worst service ever!!!!
5,"They are great, they're quicker than Fry's or Safeway and have an amazing range of items.  Plus, 3.99 beer that is usually pretty good."
5,"I was asked to move my original review to a listing for Arizona Theatre Company  instead (which I have), but I thought that my review here is also significant, for the Herberger Theatre was a great venue to showcase the phenomenal production.  The lighting was fantastic-- the subtleties were not lost on me as the scenes progressed from comedic to utter sadness, and I could almost FEEL the sunshine coming through the large windows whenever scenes from Lock Willow played out, and the cold winter air surrounding Jerusha's dorm that winter as she wrote to her ""Daddy.""  The ushers were very friendly and eager to help those who needed it, the cookies looked wonderful by the bar, and the women's restroom was tidy.

Now, if we could only get HT to emphasize in many places that it offers $3 parking validation...  
---
I thank Yelp and ATC for giving me the great opportunity to experience a terrific performance of ""Daddy Long Legs,"" ATC's first musical production at The Herberger Theater tonight!  The two-actor (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) musical, plus the invisible, but great assets, the orchestra and sound crew, entertained and amazed me w/ their execution of a well-written body of work.  It had comedy, romance, deception, and sorrow, to name a few... what's not to like?  Truly enjoyed McGinnis' impeccable timing, as well.  It is sad that many people pass up the opportunity to watch live theater due to the higher ticket fees, and I cannot fault them-- what's easier to bear: $37 per person plus $3 parking fee, which you may buy at the box office prior to attending the show, or $10 and free parking at the movies (well, at least when you're NOT catching one in downtown PHX)?  However, when you do decide to place the financial investment, you will almost always be rewarded w/ a highly-memorable night, believe you me!  

I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend ""Daddy Long Legs"" to anyone who enjoys great acting and music!  (Much thanks to McGinnis and Hancock for their lovely harmonies-- I cherished them!)"
1,"Out of business, not surprising they have been going down hill for years."
5,"I would go here all of the time when my boyfriend was at UW.  So good, smells like an old bar.  A real old fashioned wooden bar soaked in booze.  I love it.

Has a pool table and most of all the 5 star rating is for the walnut burger.  I use to be a vegetarian and I would dream about eating that thing, better than meat any day of the week.

I use to use to...
  

Good times :)"
5,"Better be down to chow down!

A super market and food extravaganza combined! While I don't come here for the super cheap produce or bags of laundry detergent, you can see me getting a large horchata at the juice bar, loading up on carne asada street tacos, getting a bowl of barbacoa, getting my ceviche on and finishing with tres leches cake. 

The entire store is lined with a bakery, a juice bar, a giant bar of all the Mexican foods you can eat, a cheese store, a sausage place, a tortilleria, a fresh fish market where you can get seafood tacos and ceviche and a carniceria. 

While other are shopping, I'm busy eating and so are other people! There are clean tables inside the super market for you to get your food, cafeteria-style, and sit down to eat. There is a full bar of salsa and toppings near by. And if you want more food... go for it!

If you prefer a sit-down, they have a restaurant attached La Tradiciones that is also fantabulous! I hear they have a brunch that while is pricey, is worth the dolla dolla bills ya'll!"
1,"This place is absolutely the worst.  If it were possible to give a lesser rating, I would.  My sister was getting married and she worked a deal with the owner for reduced alteration price for all the girls in the wedding party.  First of all, I was charged more than the agreed-to price.  I didn't want to make a big deal of it, so I just let it pass.  When I went to pick it up two weeks later, it was way too tight in the bust area.  At first, the tailor (I think her name was Stormy) refused to take the blame for the mistake.   Her response:  ""Something must have changed since you were here last.""  Was she implying that I had somehow gained a bust size in two weeks?!?  When I came back a couple weeks later (I don't live in Phoenix but was travelling there often for wedding preparations), the dress was still too tight.  The zipper zipped all the way up, but it was still so tight that I couldn't even take a full breath.  Yet the same woman was there trying to convince me that it was fine.  I think she just wanted to get me the hell out of her shop.  I insisted she redo it again and when I went back a week later (2 days before the wedding), it finally fit, but there was still more trouble.  For one thing, Stormy nearlly gave me the wrong dress.  Second, and more seriously, she freaking lost one of the straps belonging to my dress!!!  When I asked her about it, her reply was ""I guess I can look for it.""  She still hadn't found it a couple minutes later and probably would have left it at that if I hadn't pushed the issue.  Her solution was to tell me to take one of the straps off one of the other bridesmaids dresses.  Can you believe that?!?  The nerve of that woman.  COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY UNPROFESSIONAL!  She grudgingly agreed to make me a replacement strap. 

I should mention that during this entire ordeal I never once received an appology.  Stormy kept putting the blame on everything but her less-than-adequate sewing skills.  If I hadn't already paid the full amount, I would have refused to do so.

I know I'm not an isolated incident because another girl in the party had the same problems only worse.  I had to come back 3 times but she came back 5 times.  She also didn't receive any kind of appology for the trouble.

I can't and won't recommend this place, even to the truly desperate.  There's plenty of other tailors in Phoenix, do yourself a favor and try one of those."
1,"There has been so much anticipation to go to G&D for Karaokee on mondays.  After a great bbq we all decided to go and sing our hearts out...well we arrived at about 10pm...added our names to the list...cheered othered singers on to encourage a good time, spent some money and tipped well....and waited patiently....well after 2.5 hours have gone by we had seen the same three girls go up the several times before we have...we get it...if they got there before us and signed up, its their turn...but then the host started singing songs and kept picking ""random"" chicks to sings songs...ok...now its getting weird.  Then when we saw the person that signed up right before us go up and then one of the same ""three"" girls and then the host ""randomly"" pick again.....we got pissed of and were ready to leave.  We were pissed and cashed out.  Then when we told the karaokee host that he was an ass and that we had been waiting over 2 hrs and were pissed, he pretty much talked crap and walked away.  Then he had the nerve to call our names when we walked right out of the door.  We came back in and talked to management.  We were there to have a good time and spend money.  I would rather spend my money elsewhere.  Star karaokee sux, IDK what the hell Michael the Karaokee host from star karaokee's problem was, but he was completely unprofessional and just plain RUDE.  We get it, you have your regulars, but we are cusotmers too.....we would have brought more people back in the future...but you can have fun with the same three people for your pitiful karaokee night."
1,Don't rent unit 242. This is privately owned and not one of the thirty units that currently are for rent from the management company. The landlord will not pay for any maintenance while you are renting from him and he will keep your security deposit regardless of the condition of the apt. I paid two hundred dollars to have the place professionally cleaned. I also filled all the holes in the walls with spackle. He claimed he had to have the walls retextured and was keeping my deposit. The hot water in the unit takes about 15 minutes to get from the community boiler which is located in the front of the complex and never exceeds the temperature of 107 degrees. I moved because the maintenance done by the HOA is very slow and the pool is often green before it can be blue. As witnessed by the review before this. I incurred over 300.00 in plumbing expenses in the two years I was there and the owner refused to pay for any of it. Someone climbed the balcony to the second floor and stole my bike. Your parking space is no where near the unit.
5,"Been here twice now. The food is great and the place always seems busy. The staff is friendly and suprisingly the best thing about this place is the Horchata. I normally have it and am sick afterwards because it is sooooooo sweet. Comedor's has a good mellow sweetness.

Food wise I had the lengua tacos it was really ""spicy"" not like hot spicy but like a lot fo different tastes in it. My boyfriend had oh I can't remember the burrito but it had chicken, peppers, and onion. i don't like peppers and onions but the green sauce that they had put on it was sooooo good. I wish I had got some green enchiladas or something. 

Now correct me if I am wrong, why are there no Tamales? I couldn't find any? Do they not serve any or did I miss it somewhere?  That was my only complaint I went in looking for tamales but hey I got something better so I guess it's not really a complaint then huh?"
1,"Not a happy shopper. Everything was going so well.... and then a nice bait and switch happened. Found a terrific selection of stools on clearance; each one unique; each one was $30. I found my solid blue one. I want it! A tad wobbly, but that is okay - that is why it is on clearance. A store associate spends quite a bit of time talking to me about ways to keep it from wobbling. And that $30 price is a great deal, she says. Alright..I'll buy it! Bring the price tag to the cashier. Rings me up; my receipt is in hand. Calls for Manager to bring out my furniture to my car. 

Manager brings me the wrong kitchen stool. Well, he says, this is the one you bought. Hmmm.. there must be a mistake. Let me show you. I take him all the way to the store display and I tell him what happened. You see, Manager, you are trying to sell me the orange stool on display NEXT to the blue one that I bought. He says that probably some customers just moved around the price signs and he is right. I persist. Why are you trying to say I bought the stool NEXT to mine when I already showed you the price tag for MY stool and you rang me up already? You see, the one NEXT to mine still has it's price tag attached. If I were trying to buy that one..well..your cashier would have it in his hand. We debate back and forth. I question him, if the signs were shuffled around why would there be two price signs for the stool NEXT to mine?  You see each stool already has its own price tag correctly attached as you just reviewed each one. He's stoic. Well, what's the price then? Hmm.. he doesn't know and he goes back to look it up. Turns out it is $50. I don't understand. An associate was just working with me and confirmed that $30 was the price. 

Manager is adamant that customers probably just moved the signs around. I pointed around the furniture displays. Okay. Where is the $50 sign then? Was it shuffled around? Nope. No $50 sign anywhere. Just 4 stools, 4 price tags all at $30. My stool had a $30 sign, I brought it up front, paid for it and you are saying that this was a signage error? Your sales staff didn't seem to notice.

I'm standing there with my receipt for my furniture. Already worked with the sales staff. Already bought it. Now you are telling me that you want me to pay the difference?

Your mistake. Sales staff error, signage error. Don't care. Look, I worked in retail too and I know sales ticketing can be a pain. I also know what is good customer service. This is a double error on the part of the store. I think you can do better with your clientele. 

Demanded my money back. Walked out. Too bad because I usually love this place."
5,"Wow...what a nice surprise!  Chips and salsa were great, even though I usually prefer my salsa spicier than what is offered. Desert Fire Pasta was EXCELLENT, and sons loved their pork enchiladas and chicken quesadillas. Limit Two margarita was awesome (Top Shelf Conmemorativo).   Highly recommended - great food, reasonably priced, and outdoor seating wonderful!"
1,"First, I'm only rating 1 star because they don't have a negative 5 trillion.
The fact that they use "" New York"" in the title is a down right insult!! New Yorkers would spit on this pizza, actually it tastes like they did! I would serve this to some ny rats but I would be scared for their health! 

Now for the specifics. Who do you think you are charging that much for a horrible eating experience! If you are going to charge 2 bux a topping it better not taste like bacon bits! We ordered wings and asked for extra crispy. They came burnt, over cooked and floating in oil! Just not edible! 

The pizza crust is rubber and just strange tasting! The sauce is filled with sugar, and it was runny! Watery and not filled with goodness. Toppings were not fresh at all. 

The location is ify,when you walk in its dark and filled with sadness. It took 5 mins at the counter for someone to even say hi 

In closing I can not believe this place is still open let alone a chain that people keep pouring money into! 

Seriously though I had better pizza at a gas station for 2 bux! You should be ashamed of yourself"
1,"I don't get it. I see all the buses and billboards, so they MUST do something right. I've given this locations a hand full of times, and no one has ever acknowledged my existence. It seems like a lot of super dated pieces... thrift store finds at boutique prices. I've not ever enjoyed my experience there, and don't know that I'll subject myself to this location again."
5,"This is aunique place and not much else I have come across is like this. The food was very good, the staff was helpful, friendly and on top of things plus they elicit the ""Alice Cooper"" image in a very accurate way (although they did a not bring me a snake-thank God). Rock N Roll, Food, and Sports are 3 of my 4 favorite things that AC has. If you are thinking of going here or not GO! why deny yourself a very necessary experience in life!"
1,"Having won a free small frapee from the ""Family Food"" giveaway at another Burger King, I decided to go inside the Sun Prairie location to cash it in. This was after I waited for almost twenty minutes at the drive-through, even after the order taker told me she'd be with me in, ""just a second."" Inside the lobby, I was met by a scene of dirty tables, slow service, and a floor littered with a surprising ammount of plastic gloves. When I finally made it to the counter, I was amazed to learn that it is somehow possible to take my order without saying a single word to me, and then simply walking away without even handing me a reciept. Perhaps it was this same top-notch service and accuracy that caused another customer there to have to come back not once, not twice, but THREE times because they made his food wrong. At this point, my instincts said to leave, but my honor required that I stick with it to the bitter end. But when I finally got the free frapee, I was saddened to say that it was not worth the wait. If you value your ability to eat at Burger King more than your time, I would suggest staying in your car at this location and living in blissful ignorance. As for me, it'll be a while before I have it my way again."
5,Amazing free thing to do in Madison.
1,"Terrible, terrible service.  sloppy work - uneven filing, polish uneven.  impersonal and rude service.  Will not go back."
1,Never eating here again. I was sick for 2 days after I eat one of their burgers.
1,"Went here for a quick bite with family before a play at Phoenix Theater.  I was hesitant based on the reviews here about cleanliness and mediocre food, but the place is a local legend and we had to give it a try.  On the way to our booth, we passed a large empty table that still had the messy remains of previous diners and wondered why the not-busy-at-all waitstaff hadn't cleaned it up yet. The food was on the high side of ""just OK.""  The malt, ice-cream soda, and phosphates we ordered with dinner were fantastic.  But, before the final curtain of the show, the cramping began for what would be a 24-hour bout of food poisoning traced back - by process of elimination - to McAlpines chicken salad.  I suppose if you want a delicious soda fountain treat, this is your place.  If you want to eat diner food without getting sick, go somewhere else."
1,"stopped here because i was in the area. boy was that a big mistake. i too had the guy, who i wonder why they let him touch people. he is horrible and the way he did the polish what a joke. 
but the worst part was that after the pedicure from a cut that developed my foot got infected and couldnt work or barely walk for 4 days. 
never again will i go back there. 
(giving one star is being nice)"
5,"This tiny little bar in Heritage Square is adjacent to Pizzeria Bianco and is the perfect compliment to the sometimes insurmountable wait at the pizza joint. 

A date and I were there for about an hour and half while waiting for our table next door. Everyone describes it as tiny and they are right. The bar itself is immediately to the right in a very small room. So after ordering a drink for each of us we ventured into the rest of the ""house"". It opened up a bit more and we found a seat along some of the windows on a padded bench. After finishing our first round a waitress came over fairly quickly and asked if we needed anything else. More drinks and a plate of prosciutto and another round were ordered. By this time we were able to move to a large wooden table that had become vacant. 

The food came out and it was perfect. Buttery crostini and paper thin prosciutto. Perfect amount of food to wet your appetite. The atmosphere inside the bar was very laid back and soothing. The prices weren't too bad either. 4 drinks and an app came to $20. Not too bad I thought. This would be a great place to go hang out on any night and not have to worry about a table next door. Our Bar Bianco experience ended when they came and got us for our table. Those nice little touches of not having to run over to make sure you didn't get skipped are great. It allows to just enjoy your wait. 

Go hit this place up. Again, it is another impressive place."
1,"Was told this is the best place in downtown Phoenix to catch a game. It's not. They play crappy music instead of the sound from games, food is typical sports bar junk, and drinks are expensive. On top of that the crowd is pretty crappy unless you like washed up jocks acting like they own the town. If that's your thing, this is your spot."
1,"This place is getting seriously demoted. 

For the second time, I have been turned away from my absolute fave cardio class because it has filled up to capacity 45 minutes before it starts. What? Really? Does this mean I have to speed up my after-work rush just to ensure I can write my name down on their sign-in sheet? That's bogus. 

What a fiasco. The last time the class filled up, I went up to see for myself. So many regulars, who said they signed up, were without spots. That's when one went down to get the sign-in sheet and an employee. Good for her. 

Total chaos. When I asked the front desk what I needed to reserve my spot, chick-a-boo behind the counter had no clue. Then the guy who pulled out a binder really wasn't any better. I wanted to know the process. Don't just tell me to sign-up and pay a $1. I want to know how the system works, man! I said, ""Good to know for future reference,"" then I left. It's also good to know that you MUST reserve a spot IN PERSON so they can take your dollar. I don't trust them. They'd probably lose my information and I'd get screwed over, again. 

I don't use the machines there because they're shitty. I go for the one or two cardio classes that I absolutely love - because of the instructors. Everything else creeps me out, even the female locker room. 

Plus, the one time I asked the front counter staff about a personal trainer, she had NO IDEA their names. I tried to describe the one I saw upstairs working out with a client. He was doing moves I used to do, ones that really focus on stability and strength. I thought, ""He looks like he knows his stuff, and I have free sessions here I still haven't used. Oh, why not?"" Well, chick-a-boo had no clue. ""Go look over there at the board. They have their photos up."" That didn't help me, because I didn't really see the trainer on the board. Maybe he was new or he cut his hair. I don't know... How f'n annoying. It reminds me of when I first joined and asked for a trainer to give me a call. Nobody did. Suckas.

I hate this place. I hate going here, but I can't resist because of the cardio classes I love so much. ARRRRGH. It just sucks squirrel nuts that I have to show up AT LEAST an hour before class just to get a spot!"
5,"Great food great staff crappy area. Popusas were great, empanadas were delicious, yucca was the bomb (first time I eaten yucca) and the tamal wrapped in banana leaf was an unexpected surprise. From El Paso Texas with love...I'll definetly come back the next time I'm in Phoenix...salsa roja estaba deliciosa...."
5,"Going in - you know your going to get typical TGIF food.  But the view is great!  If you're a sports junky you need to eat here once.  We took my grandfather, a sports nut, for lunch (hopped off the light rail) and he loved it.  As we ate lunch on the ""patio"" we watched as the landscapers groomed the field.  The top was open, the sun was shining, a breeze was blowing...ahhh..  The service was perfect.  Our server was funny - took time to chat and made sure we had what we needed as soon (or before) we needed it."
5,"We went to Dexter's on Friday for the fish fry at the start Craft Beer week.  So we knew the wait would be long.  It was about an hour or more wait to eat.  But that didn't matter because we got to have a couple of tasty beers.  Once we sat down to eat, we started off with the clam chowder.  I loved it.  The chunks of clam were huge and tender, not chewy.  The soup wasn't too thick that it overshadowed the clams, onions and potatoes.  We both ordered the deep fried cod.  One of the best we've had.  It came out hot and crispy.  The batter wasn't too oily and you could taste the flakey cod.  The waitress was very busy but always available if we needed anything.  I can't wait to eat there more.  

I love the atmosphere at Dexters.  It's a great mix of people who are friendly and there to enjoy the beer/food."
5,"This is one of the few things that I enjoyed in Phoenix.  Actually, there is nothing else except the baseball stadium, and lots of spring training stadia...otherwise, Phoenix sucks...A city?   I think not..."
5,"I love cheese! This place is like, I imagine, many others throughout Wisconsin. But since I went to this one and liked it, 5 stars.

We stopped here on a road trip and was happy to see it open before 10. Walking in we saw more than just a cheese house. They had specialty gifts, wine, beer and fudge amongst a haven of cheese. 

The people who worked here were incredibly helpful and friendly. They were happy to give advice about what beer we would like and happily cut samples of cheese. 

Although we only left with a 6 pack of Wisconsin only beer for $9.99, I was tempted to buy much much more. It is possible we will stop on our way back!"
1,The sign on the door says they close at 9 pm. The hours posted on Yelp says they close at 9 pm and we get there at 8:30 and the doors are not locked. We go inside and the the lady mopping the floor tells us they are closed. This was extremely disappointing since we had driven from Glendale to eat there. Unfortunately we will not be returning and we will not recommend this restaurant to anyone ever again. Because they chose to waste my time I will go out of my way to share my experience with anyone willing to listen.
1,"This food was Horrible, very bland and dry I had the San Juan Combination. The Rice was dry no season or anthing. Puerto Rican Tamal was hard and dry it should have been moist and flavoral. Plantains was stiff as a rock and again no flavor. Mashed garlics plantains no flavor. My husband had Arroz con pollo the chicken was dry crispy and no flavor. Just save your money. This food had no Pizzazz or party in my mouth. The name sounds cool of the restaurant, but unfortunately so small and scrunched up. I would never recommend my friends or family at this place not even for appetizers and drinks."
1,"Need better phone service attempted to place a call-in order but didn't get anyone to answer after calling 2-3 times, pathetic."
5,"Welcome Diner in its latest incarnation is a gem. Their new hours make them far more accessible for dinner service, but you'll still want to plan on showing up relatively late, at least during the summer, as most of their seating is outside.

The food here is the star, but the workers and cooks are all having a great time, really genuine and fun, and overall make the experience even better. 

The Port of Call burger is exactly what you want: perfectly cooked, coated in cheese and onions and whatever else, and the type of meal that will leave you just barely too full.

The fried chicken sandwich is a thing of beauty, if you can unhinge your jaw to take it on. Get it with melted cheese, and go even further by tacking on gravy and bacon, if you think your heart can handle it.

The fries are fantastic as well. It's a bit pricey, but the quality of ingredients loads the food with flavor and makes it well worth it. They also have some amazing specials, and: their biscuits. Their biscuits are a thing of beauty, either with honey on them, or as part of the chicken sandwiches; they're simply perfect.

They're just a hop-skip off the 7th St. I-10 exit, and well worth trying out."
5,"Small little joint, good bbq, fast in, eat, fast out."
1,"Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Customer service was awful and my car wasn't even clean. Seriously, as I was driving away I noticed it hadn't even been wiped down inside. I would have driven back to complain, but was too upset by how I was treated by the men who were washing my car. Never going back. Ever."
5,"Out with my two boys,who, like me, enjoy exploring for great eats. Based on Yelp suggestions, I decided to give this place a shot. It was close to the art museum we were at, reasonable prices, and great food!  It is hard to find food that has great flavor, and makes you feel like you are eating a meal made by momma.  Staff was courteous and ambiance was hip. Thanks for the experience, we are definitely excited to come back!"
5,"This place couldn't be any cooler if it was renamed ""Jules Winfield's Welcome Diner""

People.  Just take a gander at the picture offered here on this page and tell me what would stop you from going there to eat an unbelievably delicious basket of fries and burger, each such perfectly seasoned to compliment one another, its as if this stuff was made from the craftsmanship of a gastronomic grill master.  The burger easily beats out even cult-status places like Delux or In n Out, and their handcut fries are subtly crunchy and salty.  Their salsa burger topping absolutely rocks the block.  And I don't know if their ketchup is made by the Magical Man from Happy Land who lives in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Lane, but something about it slaps a toothy grin on my head.

The picnic tables outside make you feel like you are doing something productive while you gorge yourself.  Like its okay to ingest a thousand calories as long as you are given the impression that you are on a hike or something.  But whatever.  Its all class.

My only beef (Heh.  Pardon the pun.)  is that Welcome Diner is closed on Sundays and that they force me to battle the tweakers at the 7th and Roosevelt Circle K as I spring for a pack of P-funks and a $20 bill due to their 'no cards' policy.  It would also be in my best interest if they started serving micro-brews from Oregon or Happy Land.  That would be right good."
5,I was surprised at how good this place was. A friend and I went on a whim and the crowd inside was a lot older (60's-70's) and mostly just drinking. We ordered the Tom Kai Gai and I have to say it was the best I've ever had in Arizona. It was spicy but extremely flavorful the consistency of the rice was gloriously sticky.We also tried the hot teas I ordered the Gunpowder Temple of Heaven and she got the Lemon Souffle` and both were beautifully prepared and flavored. The Pad Thai and Panang were both spiced to perfection and the service was great and our waitress was so friendly and helpful I wanted to come back the very next day. They also work with you on how spicy you want your dishes so if you prefer an extra kick just ask but I'd recommend trying the dishes how they prepare them first since I like spice and thought they did a great job of making the dishes spicy but not to the point where the spice overpowers the dish.
5,I highly recommend. Great professional service. My car looks awesome. Work was done in a timely manner and when I picked up my car it was spotless inside and out. Nice to deal with local business who takes pride in their work..
5,"I'm a total foodie and Chicago is great for me except we don't have NOTO. The best of the best for Creole/Cajun. Lived down south, been to N'awlins many times when I was a kid in the 70's. NOTO is the best hands down. Wish some adventuresome entrepreneur would migrate NOTO down to Chicago. It would be a huge success I am sure. We don't have anything that is even close to as good so we have to make our own or take a trip up to Madison! :)"
1,"So after reading all these reviews I thought to take a chance so I went to explore.  I arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately.  The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized.  I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup.  I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no.  I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.  The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste.  The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce.  I will not be returning to this place."
1,"There's always parents @ this Frys, who make  their kids scream &cry. I shop here, ONLY cuz it's close & cheap.    Within the past 2weeks, I got hired @ this Kroger Store (didn't even work--& got fired! cuz I have Epilepsy)  ...A few Thursdays ago, I got told by hiring manager, Holly,  ""we have ur new-hire-paperwork, u start training Sun&Monday!"".     Monday, I got a call from some1 in a Colorado area code, who claimed to be a ""doctor-in-association-w/Frys"". He said I was positive for marijuana--I told him, yeah, I'm disabled & have a (legal) medical marijuana prescription for my Epilepsy in AZ. The Colorado-""doctor"" told me, I might not get hired by Frys, cuz they don't hire people w/this medical prescription!!  On Tuesday I still had No call back from Frys (eventho I was supposed to have worked Sun & Mon). I went to Frys & asked Holly, ""Oh, I don't have a job? Why didn't u call me?"".  Holly, kept saying that I didn't pass some form of screening test.  How come this hiring manager said I WAS HIRED?!"
5,"We used to have a membership here, and we loved it then. We would bring the kids, and although they don't have a TON of stuff for little ones, it was a very happy medium for us fact-hungry parents. We had passes and would bring friends with us all the time who loved it.

We went again, just the two of us, for the Yelp event. And it was amazing. I loved the little hands on exhibit that they had, and the way they have the exhibits set up is just so perfect. We are now DYING to try out the bike ride, cable thing. And the planetarium is just... breathtaking. Loved it. The staff is always great, and they are so knowledgeable!

The one downside is that not only are they kinda pricey for the whole family, but then they charge for the extra exhibits on top of it. If me and my little family of 4 wanted to check out everything, it would easily cost us a hundred bucks. 

But even with that, the planetarium and staff pull my rating all the way up to 5 stars. You can see the prices online, and it's not geared to very small children. But if you want something specifically for them, try the children's museum. All in all, what a great addition to our blossoming city!"
5,"If I keep having flashbacks about my lovely dinner here last night, then it must be worthy of 5 stars. 

Husband and I went here for a late dinner last night on our anniverary-eve. It was a Monday, and there were only two other couples there, so it was nice and quiet. The ambience is relaxed and warm, and our server was attentive and informative, but not smothering.

We started with a three-cheese plate. They have a long list of cheese varieties from which to choose. We got the Truffle Tremor (goat), Abbaye (Sheep) and Three Sisters of Serena (cow). It comes with baguette slices, pear slices, strawberries, grapes, dried cranberries, almonds, and a delicious candied-syruppy-dried-fruit-and-nut combination.

I ordered the duck for my entree, and it was superb. The duck breast was excellent, but the best part was the blue-cheese-potato croquette and the diced mango and poblano relish. I could have licked my plate. 

We were too full for dessert, but they looked great.

I loved that you can order half-glasses of wine. It gave me a chance to taste a couple of different kinds without a)breaking the bank, and b)getting so sloshed that I couldn't drive home.

I enjoyed everything about my experience here. The only drawback to the entire meal was that the server told us that the mac-and-cheese plate was big enough for a meal, but when it came, it was actually pretty small (perfect size for a starter). Husband insisted that it was just enough, but I would have preferred he have a bigger main course. But I digress.

Expect to pay upwards of $50/person if you go all out and order wine, starters, and entrees, but this could easily be an affordable dinner at happy hour or if you just get a few starter plates to share. The portions are adequate, but not really big enough to take home leftovers.

I can't wait to go back to sample some more wine and cheese!"
1,"I have shopped at bestbuy on a handful of occasions.  Once at this particular store.  I have never had genuine customer service experience from this establishment.   Every time I shopped here I feel like I am bothering an employee when I ask questions or call in for service status.    

My last experience was with a camera that had an issue.  This issue was covered under the extra plan I purchased.  I took the camera in.   After 2 weeks I received an automated phone call that my camera was ready for pick-up at the Geek Squad counter.  Before leaving the store I did as most do and I checked out the repair.   The camera was exactly the same as it was before I gave it to the geek squad.  I showed the customer service lady and she said that the paper work shows it was repaired.  She said if I was not happy with the repair I could sign the paper work and re-submit the claim.  This is when I got furious.   I was being asked to sign a paper stating I was happy with the repair and then re-submit the claim that the camera was still broken!!  I refused to sign the paper and asked that the camera be re-submitted with out a second claim.  During all of this I was never apologized to or offered an expedited service.  I had to ask for the camera to be expedited the second time around.  I don't believe they expedited the second claim since it still took another 2 weeks for the camera to come in.  They camera was repaired the second time but I was out of a camera for a month and never did receive an apology. 

I have learned my lesson for the last time.   I will now purchase my electronics from one place and this place is newegg.com  These guys know customer service and have a customer for life."
5,"Very fitting restaurant and atmosphere before our group of 21 enjoyed the Billy Joel ( and Gavin DeGraw opening right across the street at the US Airways Center) concert.  The food was awesome and served hot and promptly- the  grilled salmon was perfect and the mashed potatoes were to die for; ribs were huge and tasty. The chocolate cheesecake was delicious. The awesome Stephanie set this up for our large group of 21 and we had 2 large tables reserved and set up right smack in the middle of the main dining area. Our servers Catie and SaBeth were spectacular - on the ball, very caring and patient with this sometimes crazy and demanding group of ex NYers. It was a fun atmosphere with Billy Joel songs playing and the waitresses leading the guests in clapping, singing "" Happy Birthday"" to our friend Gail and just having fun. 5 stars all the way."
1,"I recently went to a wedding reception here. I felt sorry for the bride and groom. The place was not clean for starters. The food was the worst part. The salad was soggy from the dressing sitting on it for far too long and then they put on top a hot fresh baked bread stick that came from the freezer, which in turn made the salad hot. I had the sirloin, it was cold, chewy, and bland. My date had the vegetarian pasta, it was over done spinach pasta with some sort of flavorless cream sauce and veggies. Mix in overpriced drinks and you have one of the worst wedding reception venues ever. Stay away!"
1,"Cockroach on table (and a neighboring table). Lamb super mealy. Wine bottle ""opened"" in back and then brought to table with cork from another bottle. No apologies. Just arguments. You've been warned."
1,"This is by far the worst place I have ever lived in my adult life. There is absolutely no communication here what so ever!!!  The water has been turned off twice this month with no advanced warning so far. And when I've called the office they are either clueless or they don't answer the phone at all.  

The on site management is a very bad joke. He doesn't answer his door or texts when there's an issue. 

If you want any peace of mind at all in a place you call home I strongly, strongly suggest you go elsewhere."
1,"Really disappointing customer service experience.  

I purchased tickets originally to see the production of Pippin.  Being a frequent flyer at Gammage, the Herberger, the Phoenix Symphony, etc, I was really excited for my first experience at the Phoenix Theater.  Also I heard great things about the show.  

We found out the day of the show that the production was cancelled due to an injury in the cast.  Completely understandable and I was happy to reschedule.  Due to travel for work, the only other show I could make was the last showing on Sunday.  

Unfortunately, I was delayed due to weather in the East Coast and missed the show.  The Phoenix Theater box office has rather limited phone hours and I was unable to get a hold of anyone.  Finally, on the day following the show, I spoke with a person who basically refused to help me in any capacity.

I would have been happy with a refund, an exchange, a coupon for a cookie, anything.  But instead the Phoenix Theater took my money ($180) and said ""Sorry.""  Surprising given the fact that I've found other venues very accommodating (looking at you Gammage).  I am in a customer-focused industry, and simply taking a one's money while offering nothing in return is incredibly poor service.

Sincerely,

Not-one-to-leave-really-bad-reviews-often"
1,"I've never experienced this before, but I'm just going to let you be the judge:

I am starting to watch/count my calorie load, especially when I am eating out.

American Chinese is famous for huge calorie loads in the sauces and fried treatments, so I thought I would split the middle and order a brown steamed rice with broccoli and beef.

Well, I asked the young lady behind the counter for the calorie count chart and she quickly said she would have to ask someone. No problem and expected...but what happened next was not:

She walked to the back of the galley-style kitchen past the viewing, walkin freezer to find her manager. Outside of the freezer is the prep area with a large gray garbage can. She stood there, asking her question, HOLDING THE GARBAGE CAN. Then she and the manager walked back to me.  The manager came with the paper and placed it on the prep line. And she grabbed a bowl to serve me. WAAAAAAIT! ""Uh, excise me. Is that a garbage can?"" I asked. She looked back and asked where. ""There...in front of the freezer...the big gray thing with the black garbage bag stretched around the rim."" ""Yes"". I asked her if she realized that she stood there and grabbed the rim and talked to her manager. ""No,"" she replied. ""My dear, I watched you and you not only grabbed the garbage can you just came and grabbed my bowl to serve me."" She put the bowl down and walked away, washed her hands and apologized.

Needless to say, I won't be coming back."
5,I thought Joyce did a fantastic job with my wedding dress.  It was significantly large when I brought it to her and it fit perfect when I picked it up.  I got more than one comment that it fit like a glove.  She was timely and friendly.
5,"Having lived in the neighborhood for eight years, I can't say much other than: variety, reliable, authentic. But what I'm really compelled to tell you all about is...

They now serve Thai! In addition to their already huge menu! 

The Chicken Pad Thai is arguably the best I've ever had (I've had it in New York and San Francisco). Its crazy how good it is... I had to have it two days in a row to confirm. I've had the green curry and that was yummy - fresh veggies in everything, crispy and plentiful.

IMHO, their decor rocks! I love the cheesy waterfall in the front, the chairs with coffee cup designs and giant turntable-centered family-sized tables. The green walls are an upgrade from the pink and blue that was there before. Go to Fate if you want to sit in faux-modern Ikea surroundings.

This place is classic Mc Do Well"
1,"Can I give these company a worse score?  Less than 2 years later, the pump I purchased is broken. My regular pool guy (who was out of town in August of 2011 when I wrote the 1st review) took the pump apart and found out that it was never grounded.  Buyer BEWARE!! I am not the only person this happened to. No apologies. No warranty. Nothing."
1,"I went to rent storage space at this company (applies to all locations)and was VERY close to renting from them( I gave them my drivers' license and a US Passport for ID).The rental agent told me that they require fingerprints as well as a palmprint according to corporate rental policy. UNTIL they wanted my FINGERPRINTS and PALMPRINT  in order to rent a space I was ok with everything. I asked why.When I said that I was all for biometrics for safety they looked at me confused as they did not understand what that was.When I informed them that it involves the use of a fingerprint in order to gain access they stated that they weren't that advanced yet.
I then asked what they wanted my fingerprints and palmprint for and they stated security.I then asked that if my fingerprints were going to be compared every time someones' storage facility was broken into and they stated NO.I then asked what do you want fingerprints for then.
You can go to a bank and cash a sizeable check and they require an index finger print,which I can understand,BUT this is a storage facility for crying out loud and people are required to have or purchase insurance in case of something happening.All it takes is a disgruntled employee lifting your prints to place elsewhere and frame someone for a crime.
I even tried calling the district mgr.(from outside the facility) for a further clarification and left a voicemail message to call me as he did not answer. I was also asked to leave the facility in the middle of my phone call.I complied. I am still waiting 2 days later for a return call.
Potential renters BEWARE AND TAKE NOTICE!!!
This is NOT a place to rent storage space from.
They are obviously treating everyone that rents from them as a criminal element.THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR DEMANDS TO SUPPLY FINGERPRINTS.
I asked them should a storage unit get broken into are they then going to run my fingerprints in a database in order to eliminate me from being a suspect in the break in and they stated NO.I then again asked them what they needed fingerprints supplied to them for and they stated MY safety.Sounds VERY FISHY ro me.
Needless to say I am NOT RENTING from this concern
When I asked other facilities around town if that is a requirement in order to rent from them they all laugh and say no.For the people that do supply them with fingerprints and rent from them, they must be idiots.
You can lift fingerprints from a fingerprint card with scotch tape and plant it anywhere you like.It is that easy.
A word of WARNING.STAY AWAY FROM  THIS STORAGE FACILITY. RENT SOMEPLACE ELSE.THEY ARE NOT LOOKING OUT FOR YOU AT ALL.
MY NAME IS RICH AND I CAN BE REACHED AT 602-316-3660 IN CASE YOU WISH TO CALL.DO YOU HEAR THAT CORPORATE.i DARE YOU TO CALL ME."
5,"We adopted our dog from DCHS a few months ago, and couldn't be happier with our experience there. It was after about 5 visits that we met her, and instantly fell in love with her. During each of those visits we had great experiences with the staff there - they were all very friendly, patient and helpful. We witnessed others receiving the same level of service. They seem really interested in pairing the dogs up with the right people. 

Betsy M.: perhaps your parents should revisit this shelter. Help is readily available, and there is a wealth of information about each dog attached to their kennel, and you can get their whole health folder upon request. 

Additionally, the adoption fees are almost always $175, though they are $250 for a puppy or $275-350 for a ""highly desirable"" breed (which I think they rarely label dogs as that - all of the dogs we encountered, including purebreds, were the standard $175). Considering that all of their dogs are spayed/neutered, microchipped, updated on most vaccinations, and given vet exams, I don't think that their rates are unreasonable. In fact, they were lower than two other local shelters not related to the Humane Society.

I have often heard how they do put so many dogs to sleep here, and it does upset me a great deal. However, rather than avoid them for that, I think it's all the more reason why we should adopt our dogs and really be able to rescue them. Avoiding a shelter because of that will not help the animals. PLEASE consider adopting before you look to a pet store or a breeder!"
5,"Been here a few times and loved it every time. my favorite items are the popusas, pan con pollo, and the sopa De pata. If you like menudo you'll like the sopa De pata. I give all the credit to my girlfriend for introducing me to this place. I owe her big time. Yummy yummy for the tummy."
5,"Don't pass this place by!!!  Several selling points:

1.  It will make any day of the week a staycation!  
2.  Agua Frescas - fair warning - you will be hooked in no time!
3.  Best and cheapest lunch in town!
4.  The meat counter is the best in town - like the butcher your mom grew up going to - not ""supermarket-ish"" at all
5.  THE FISH MARKET - OMG!  if you have ever lived near a coast with fresh fish markets - you will be as close as you can get to that in the DESERT!  Not to mention the Ceviche assortment ready to be packaged up and taken home - or eaten right there!
6.  Fruits and Vegetables - great prices

I normally wouldn't recommend going grocery shopping while hungry - but at this place it is a must!  Try everything - and take more home!"
5,"Their banana pie and carrot cake are SUPER!!!!!!!
and if you happen to buy the whole container, you are required to give a 5-dollar deposit which will be returned if you bring it back.

Oh Monty, finally!
This morning, though I am still a little bit ill, I came only for you :) (and for me:))
Waiting for less than 10 minutes, we were seated by the window. A very nice spot. 

I decided quickly: I wanted to have a dish of scramble ""something"" (hahaha, I found this funny, I was wondering what ""something"" meant. I asked the server and she said it is for broccoli, pepper, some cheese (and God knows what else!-- too many to list! :D) and has no meat (yay!)
Hubby ordered a dish of pesto omelet! Both came with homemade biscuit- I'm in love with this biscuit right away! We enjoyed our brunch soooooooooooo much. 
I told the waiter: The food is excellent! I wanna come back soon!

The food is a five.
The service is a five.
Yes, full score for you, Monty. 

Sshhhhh, don't forget to also order their coffee and the donut.
The coffee is really an eye opener and the donut is ridiculously huge but so GOOD.

Monty has made my Saturday happy! and I really need that after one week of my illness :(
Mahalo, Monty!"
1,"I will never order flowers through Cactus Flowers again.  I ordered flowers online to be delivered on Saturday 2/11 for a friend's mom for her birthday.  They delivered without the personalized card.  My order confirmation clearly shows the message I had written for her.  She had to call Cactus Flowers twice to figure out who they were from and the employee she spoke to was incredibly rude to her.   Also the flowers did not look like what I had ordered.  In the picture there are purple flowers which they just left out completely.  I called Cactus Flowers the next day, Sunday to try and figure out what happened.  Even though I had my order number, it still took her 10 minutes to find my order.  Apparently the flowers had come out of their Carefree location so if I wanted them to deliver a new bouquet, she would call that location to make sure they had all the flowers that were supposed to be in it.  She said she would call me back and let me know.  I had a missed call from them later in the day but no voicemail.  It took me until THursday to get back in touch with them due to my work schedule and the fact that....wait for it.....they have no voicemail.  What kind of business operates with no way for anyone to leave them a message?

So on Thursday I finally reached them and spoke to someone else and she told me that they would redeliver Friday or Saturday.  Guess what, it didn't happen!  I called back yesterday and spoke to someone who was less than pleasant and she said she would have a manager call me back today.  It is now 3:00 and I haven't heard from anyone.  I'm sure I will have to call them back, again.  I don't think I have ever experienced such crappy customer service.  It actually takes effort to suck as much as they do.  

Moral of this story:  Do not use Cactus Flowers.  I will return to using Pro Flowers as I have never had any issues with them."
1,"For a salon with a name as refreshing as Tangles Salon, this business sure has a its Goldilocks well....tangled. Although this location carries the Aveda name, it appears to be buckling under its weight. There are many issues at this salon, and only a few will be mentioned here.

Tangles Salon has had a somewhat tortured existence here in the Madison area, what with experiencing not-so-smooth management changes, relocating attempts, massive employee walkouts, and even a fire in the past 2 years alone. One begins to wonder how they have stayed afloat as long as they have.

After a devastating fire destroyed Tangles, it was clear that many once loyal customers had been caught in the middle of the chaos. Some arrived at the salon for their appointments, only to find the building in charred ruins, and most never got a courtesy call from the owners. Furthermore, the fire raises red flags related to safety, Although not mentioned in the police report, many ex-clients have speculated that the entire situation was suspicious.

A receptionist named Deeon, was at the front desk when I last entered Tangles. He welcomed me to the salon, but his demeanor was cold and businesslike. He seemed very out of place in the salon, and didn't seem to really enjoy being there as he led me to the chair. I waited for 10 minutes for my stylist to come over from the very noisy break room I was unfortunate enough to have been next to. As I was waiting, I noticed an accumulation of hair and dust around the edges of the station. There were also many dead insects in the overhead fluorescent lighting, indicating lack of cleanliness throughout the salon.

On the plus side, Tangles does have some talented stylists. But without the proper management and support, their work remains spotty and inconsistent at best.

I wanted to like this salon, but found it difficult to look past the issues. It is important to note that it is difficult for any business to survive changing locations multiple times. However, when combined with the suspicious fire, the disgruntled clients, and the unstable behind the scenes management, it is safe to say that Tangles needs a deep conditioning treatment if they want to remain relevant in this city."
1,"This Culvers gives Culvers a bad name. Ive had excessively slow service, hair in my ice cream and burgers that resemble dog food and that's enough for me. Ive never quite seen a burger paddy so thin and greasy before in my life. You've  got to be desperate to eat there."
1,"Owner or whoever was at the counter was extremely rude. I asked if they sold hot dogs because I was not familiar with the menu and the guy replies, ""I don't know, we're getting ready to close."" okaaay???? 
So I went to Johnnie's instead and had the BEST Chicago style hot dog and it was cheaper too!"
1,"overpriced and grocery carts are in the parking lot if you need one. I prefer a Sprouts, Safeway, or Frys."
1,"If I could give a zero I could.  Waited 45 minutes for a 7:30 reservation.
Were told ""We are overbooked"".  Downhill from there.  There was no place to wait so we stood in the middle of the restaurant jostled by waiters and customers.  Our waiter was clueless and disappeared during our ordering and our meals.  The entrees arrived before the appetizer and the before meal bread came as we were finishing dinner. My chicken enchiladas had no discernible chicken and was just a large mush pile. None of us five liked our meals.  The only good thing was the roasted beet side dish.  Maybe this qualified for one star.
This used to be our favorite restaurant in the area.  No longer.  The staff
Treated us like we were in a post office.  The hype is killing them.  The kitchen and especially the employees need attitude and training lessons.
The owner needs a wake up call."
5,"Louisianne's has seared it's place inside of my restaurant experience. The food is so good, that every time my girlfriend and I consider going to any other restuarant, we would have to consider the huge opportunity cost of not going to Louisianne's.

The place is dungeon-esque, but not in a bad way. It's dimly lit, underground, but often times has a pianist setting the New Orleans mood.

The food is incredible. Every time we go there we try to get something different, and we're floored by how good the meals are, and how much of it you get. The appetizers were delicious (we've had the platter for two, and the pulled pork crepes), the soup we've had with our entrees were amazing each time, with an intense flavor.

Their specials change every time we've been there, and if they don't interest you, their regular menu is always exceptional. We've had the roasted shrimp, the tasso and shrimp fettucine, the maple-cured duck, the steak, the seafood au gratin, and each time not only did we get one delicious meal, but enough to have an amazing lunch the next day.

The only con I can give Louisianne's is that they give you so much good food that you can never get to the desserts. This restaurant is the one that my girlfriend and I benchmark all other restaurants by, and before we go out to eat anywhere else, we have to strongly consider the consequences of NOT going to Louisianne's."
5,"Really good service.  James at the bar made some really good recommendations. The place is right next to Pizzeria Bianco.  So while you wait for a table there, come here for a drink and kick it.

They also have a great wine menu, if you're into that.  I guess on Fridays they have a live band playing inside."
1,"We loved this store..... for about a month. Then they sold us fish KNOWING they had ick. We knew it was the new fish because they had spots first.  After trying two different medicines all but one of our fish died. We took back the ones we had gotten from petsmart and I said, ""hey I think your fish gave our tank ick"" the employee responded with ""probably we found ick in one of our tanks and there's one fileter for all our tanks"" I could not believe it. Why would you knowingly sell someone sick fish? They wouldn't even refund our money for the fish we had bought. If you ask me they should have payed for the rest of the fish they killed and the two bottles of medicine too! We will never go back."
5,Had the Mac and Cheese with Chicken and the Biscuits and Gravy with fried chicken. Both were hands down the amazing!! The restaurant is unique looking and has mainly outdoor seating. A great place with character and its open late. A MUST TRY while you are in the Phoenix Downtown Area.
1,"Two words, BABY ROACH..... yes I said it.. and it's true and I hate to because I've know of Macayo's in it's better days, but they've gone down hill. I've only got the steak fajitas here. Every-time I walk in seems like the front-desk is f'ing off somewhere, but at least when they show up we get seated right then. Never waited very long, 1st steak fajitas seems fine. 2nd time the steak a little undercooked, but I didn't complain (I sometimes have my steaks medium rare), 3rd time they served me all onions and no bell peppers with my steak, my Wife's meal didn't come a listed on the menu and about 10 seconds after they brought out an additional plate tortillas I saw a baby roach walking on the table. I secretly squished it (with a napkin) and never told my Wife or she would have thrown up..... We left immediately... True story."
1,"Why would a person want to go into a place where they virtually never get your order right.  How does an order for 2 large pomegranate smoothies with wheat grass blended in become half a banana with a side of wheat grass and a small pomegranate smoothie with a side of wheat grass?  What is worse when the fellow making the order argues with you that the order is right and you are wrong?  This is typical of the place.  A friend likes to go in there or they'd never see me again.  I make them read back what I order or they don't get my AMEX,   You can make then print out an itemized receipt.  I'd suggest it.   In all fairness, I can tell you they have gotten my order correct one and a half times.  That's not saying much is it.

The company could also spend a little money on some sound proofing this place.  I agree with Nadia C, with all the mixers going and the music, it's not some place you want to be for long.  But, they could spend the money to train their staff to learn how to ring orders properly, so making the place a little more quiet obviously is wishful thinking.

The parking leaves a lot to be desired now that the Verizon office is a few doors down from them.  You'd better be fast when there is an empty spot or it can really become ugly.

The best thing I can say for the place is they have good oatmeal.

I have truly enjoyed writing this review!

If you really want a much better smoothie go to Robeks on the NE corner of 16th and Camelback,  It's cleaner, nicer set up, and they have a magic ability to get your order right."
5,"Built out of an old Country Kitchen, this friendly neighborhood bar and grill has lots of room.  Great food at a reasonable price too I might add.  If you are a sports fan, this is a great bar...several TV sets with your favorite games.  If it's your birthday, you'll get to drink free tap beer all night long too.  The employees are very friendly and attentive.  Visti the website: http://www.silvereaglebar.net/"
5,Alpha Books has a pleasant vibe; shall we say. ;) And Joy is a class act. I've known her and John for the better part of 20 years now...............
1,Do not eat here any place that has bugs climbing in its dinning room means bugs in the kitchen. Will never ever eat the food here!
5,"THE place for pregame lunch. Service is almost always great, I've only had one waitress who was not so good and I've been going there for years. Lots of room and it gets packed! I LOVE their blue Dean Martin Margarita and the veggie quesadilla. My husband is a big fan of the Devil's Ale and Pratt's pulled pork. The prices are very reasonable and I love that they offer mandarin oranges as a side. They also stock my favorite hot sauce instead of just Tabasco. Lots of fun stuff to look at on the walls and always a good mix of sports on TV.  Always a good time."
1,"Awful, awful customer service - so bad in fact that we were too thoroughly disgusted to stay for the meal. We came here on a Sunday afternoon, which was my first and last time.  I've been to other Houston's locations in California - and have had decent times there.  In fact, I love the thai steak salad.

 However, this time some 20 year old idiot host walked us to our table (and before we even sat down) and told us ""My mom taught me good manners, so I've always taken my hat off at the dinner table.""  

Huh?  First of all, I was dressed nicely in a button up shirt, and was wearing my favorite football team hat who had just won the championship the day before.  Secondly, I hadn't even sat down at the table yet, asswipe.  Thirdly, while I understand this isn't Applebees, this also isn't Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, douche bag.  And don't talk to me like I'm 7 years old.

No sooner had the idiot host left before we walked into the kitchen to get the manager  to bitch him out about his insulting employee.  The manager was pretty much dismissive.  Well, guess what - I'm pretty much dismissive about this poor excuse for a restaurant. 

1 STAR - not going back!!"
5,"I've been here about a dozen times now and I have never written a review.... but I could write a super review for each of those times.  Tonight I was on my own so I got galee gai and sticky rice to go.  The galee gai is a spicy yellow curry - similar to masaman curry but spicier.  Now, I am a total wimp and this is always spicier than I really can handle but it is so good I deal with it!  I put it on rice and drink a lot of tea :-)  The sticky rice is coconut sweet and, well, sticky.  I have ordered sticky rice at other places and it never compares to Wild Thaiger.  I am happy to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!"
1,"I recently found out I was pregnant and was researching OBGYNs in my area (Downtown Phx) I tried out this place because it was right near my house and the reviews seemed ok.  From the moment I got to the office I was already turned off and regretted coming here, I arrived 15 mins early and filled out all my paperwork and STILL waited for an hour just to be seen! Everyone in the waiting room was called before I was and I wasn't even seeing my actual Dr, I was assigned a PA instead.  I did the usual Urine sample, and they took my blood and vitals but the PA kept asking me questions I already answered to the nurse which made me notice she wasn't even looking at my file nor had it with her, she was just taking notes on the Patient info sheet I filled out.  She breezed through a low quality ultrasound and I had to ask her for pics which were blurry and barely even worth printing when I saw them.  She explained that I would be going to a different facility in 2 weeks for the ultrasound and then go back to their office for the check up which I wasn't happy about having to go to multiple places but understood.  When she finished I had to ask her about the results of the UA since I told her I felt like I may have a UTI, she told me everything looked fine but they would have to send it out to get those results (I've never heard of not getting UTI results the same day) and that she would just send a script for an antibiotic to my pharmacy which would be ready when I left there and that they would call in a couple days and tell me the results and I could stop taking them if they were negative.  I waited until the next day to go to the Pharm and no script was sent, I called the OBGYN and explained there was supposed to be a script for an antibiotic and they said they would send it over. the next day the pharm called to tell me my script for prenatal was ready but that was all that was sent. I didn't even ask for prenatals since they're over the counter!!!! called the DR AGAIN and had it sent over, still no call from the Dr regarding my results but I thought I would wait another day.  still a week later and 3 calls asking for my results and I had to call THEM to find out that the results had been in and are negative but the PA must have overlooked needing to call and let me know.  I have requested my file and am switching to Maricopa OBGYN, I'm very disappointed in my first prenatal Dr visit as this should be a happy time and your doctor should make you feel comfortable, I hope Maricopa can turn this around and make it a positive experience for me as it should be."
1,"A friend proposed Club Tavern for fish fry.  None of us had ever been there.
While the food overall wasnt the WORST I've had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first ""real"" meal you've had in ages.  To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.

We arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.

I ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.  Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead.  Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere.  Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.
Friend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.

After the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.
20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said ""oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.""
5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said ""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.""
5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.

They were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.

Finally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:
Fish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.
Fries: Were best part of the meal.
Tartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.
Coleslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.

Ordered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.

We were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.
He came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.

Finishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.

Maybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.

The best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.

We  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.

30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.

girlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.  Also noted her old fashioned came w cherries and olives in it, which is taboo? Supposed to be one or other?  Im a crazy WI who doesnt order many OF's, so not sure about this."
1,"If you like extremely hot hotel rooms, bad customer service, and being charged twice for a stay, then this is the hotel for you. The room literally was 77 degrees when I arrived, and 82 degrees when I awoke. I had the AC set to 60...the room was so hot, I was supposed to stay two days, but checked out early because of how miserable my sleep was. Do you think they only charged me for one night, nope, still got charged for two. When I called to get this rectified, they told me it would take a while for somebody to get back to me in order to fix the situation and put me right into somebody's voice mail...the reality is, I shouldn't have even been charged for one night because I wasn't able to sleep in this nightmare hotel."
1,"I hate this Safeway. I don't even think it's that ghetto, and I've never had a problem with things being out of stock. Even the prices are pretty good.
This is the closest grocery store to my house and I try to never shop there if I can help it. The reason? There are NEVER enough cashiers. I have never ever ever ever ever ever gone in and seen more than 2 cashiers working. Why do they even have 10 checkout lines if they're only going to use ONE most of the time? This is one of the only groceries downtown so I don't understand why they would close early(...10pm I think), and have one lonely cashier working during BUSY times. I once came here in the evening around 9 and stood in line for 40 minutes to pay for the one or two things I had bought. I couldn't believe it. That was over 2 years ago, and nothing has changed here, and you KNOW they get complaints about it, but they're obviously not changing anything.
You would be better off going to the Bashas or Safeway on 7th Ave & Osborn, or Fresh and Easy on 7th Ave and Indian School. Any time you would have saved driving to the closer grocery store would be more than lost standing in their outrageous checkout lines."
5,"They're back as of today, and they're awesome. I was turned on to the Welcome Diner by a classmate at a software training I was attending, I said I was a food nerd and he told me that these guys were reopening today!
Solid yelp reviews sold me, and they did NOT disappoint.
They opened at 5:00, but I got off of class at about 4:15, so I went down there and hung around for a bit. After unsuccessfully attempting to help out with their square credit card thing (they can take cards, but it'll show up as the food truck because the restaurant account isn't setting up properly), I placed my order. I was the first customer, yay! Amazingly, the only other opening day jitter I saw was the ricecooker being ornery and tripping the circuit breaker repeatedly. In terms of ""disasters"" that's a pretty minimal one. I chose to wait for the rice to finish and get my meal all together, as I needed to burn time to avoid getting out of central Phoenix back to Tucson at rush hour.
I had the port of call burger and a side of red beans and rice (the ricecooker worked in the end).
Best burger I've had, I think ever. All the ingredients were high quality, very nice cheddar cheese, mushrooms cooked with port, and garlic aioli. And the bun. Oh damn, the bun. Feathery is the best adjective. No unevenness in texture, light, and just barely strong enough to contain the burger... well maybe not entirely contain.
The red beans and rice were good - I'm not well versed in the craft of that dish, but it was tasty.
Both the other customers that ordered inside got the fried chicken biscuit sandwich with apple butter made by one of the staff. They seemed very happy with their choices.

They've got beer, wine, and hurricanes. Right now they're open Thursday-Saturday 5:00-10:00pm for dinner, and Saturday and Sunday from 10:00-3:00pm for brunch. I snuck a peek at the brunch menu, and there looked to be some tasty stuff there too. They're going to work on expanding dinner service out over more of the week gradually.





What are you doing?
Yeah. 
You.
Why are you still reading this?
Go get a burger or something from here.
Blah blah blah it's Tuesday at 9am and they're not open, sure, whatever, maybe that excuse will fly with your family, but not here mister/missy."
5,"I love the Wild Thaiger, it is the best Thai food I have experienced in Phoenix.  They have plenty of vegetarian options and I have ordered just about all of them, they are all equally delicious.  I love the corn fritters... MMMM"
1,"I bought a travel zoo voucher for my daughter, me, and mother-in-law to get a mani/pedi. I even took my daughter out of school early for our special day, since they don't have later times for nail services. That morning, they called to tell me that they couldn't take all of us, and we would have to re-schedule. This was not an option for me, so it ended up just being my daughter and mom-in-law getting service. 

Thought I would give them another chance. Next time, the appt was for me, my daughter, and my own mom. I took my daughter out of school early again. This time, when we arrived, they said that there was an error in scheduling and we would need to re-schedule. Really? Again, this was not an option for me. So my mom and daughter just got pedicures (even though we had paid for a manicure too). No attempt to offer a discount or anything.

Their front desk staff is less than incompetent. Make sure you have a plan B, before you go. WIll never go back."
5,"I hit something on the freeway on-ramp and lost power. The second call I made was to Bavarian informing them I was coming in on a flat bed. AAA towing rocked and I eas there in no time.

Andrew called and told me what the problem was and its cost. I asked if its possible to add oil change and engine mounts. We'd discussed mounts at the last visit, there was a wear mark on an pipe.

I was expecting at least another day to get my car fixed. 

It took about 38 hours from accident time to fix plus adding in extra repairs to get my car back.

And affordable for BMW!

Bavarian Motors... you rock my face off!!!"
1,"Ordered two basic and simple rolls and received sushi that looked rolled by a child.  Sloppy presentation and rice was super tacky to the point of staleness.  Decided not to buy any more rolls since they failed the first two tester rolls.  If you cannot make a spicy tuna roll you have no business calling yourself a sushi place.  Pad Thai sounded yummy and ordered chicken added to the dish.  We were going to forgive the rolls since we can be a little snooty about sushi, but shouldn't you be?  Its not like you ordered anything cheap.  After two bites into the Pad Thai I bit into a bone! Mmm...wasnt expecting that!  I spit out the bone and looked through the Pad Thai to find three bone shards in the noodles.  Wanting to bring it to the attention of the management, cause I would want to know if it were my place if bone fragements were being served by accident to my patrons, we waited 15 mins to be told that they would make us another dish.  Aftering waiting for so long, the appetite for this place was gone and we asked if they could just remove the item from the bill.  The manager said,""Of course, sorry.""  No big deal until we got the bill and only the additional charge for chicken was removed from the bill.  Asking to speak to the manager again since we were told the entree was going to be removed we were told, ""I took the chicken off since that is what you had a problem with and everyone know that is the risk you take when eating chicken, cuz chicken's have bones."" WHAT?! I was dumbfounded, not only bad food, bad service from management (server was great!) but we were actually insulted!  Wow, interesting business ethics.  No mo Moto fo sho!"
5,"This is it! This still stands as my most favorite Thai Restaurant ever! I love the food here. Plus, the minute you walk in the wonderful smell of all the spices is so warm and inviting. It is cosey in here and romantic ,smells great, and has great service. So it is a win, win all the way around.
Everything I have ever tried here has been delicious,but my favorite is still the Yellow Chicken Curry.
Lots of parking in the back, right next door to Durant's on Central."
1,"First of all the person below me who is the only one who wrote a positive review either is office staff or just does not live in the complex at all. OFFICE STAFF OFFICE STAFF OFFICE STAFF. Just terrible, rude, and to be blunt most are just unintelligent. Sure they are nice to you upon your initial arrival...until you sign the lease. I have lived here for almost 2 years now and have nothing but issues with the majority of the rude and less than intelligent office staff. Sure the apartments area decent priced...due to the low price it does allow less than desirable tenants. (putting it as nicely as possible)
The maintenance is fine, and the grounds are pretty well maintained, decent pool areas and work out area (Not even close to the work out equipment at Gold's, as one review states) I just cant say enough about the poor customer service and property management...DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!"
5,"My husband and I just moved to Phoenix from Northern California, the land of good Thai, and Wild Thaiger was the first Thai place we tried in the Valley of the Sun. Let's just say that the quality ingredients and enticing flavors made us feel a little less homesick. The prices were not rock-bottom, but I am always willing to pay a little more for good food and larger portions, both of which Wild Thaiger offers. The papaya salad was refreshing and really authentic, although the shrimp were a little fishy for our tastes. The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken. And lest I forgot alcohol - the crowning glory of any meal - the specialty drinks offered seemed like they would be too sweet or weak, so my sister and I got Cosmos. They were appropriately strong and actually quite good! All around, a really great experience."
5,"This place is awesome! Great atmosphere, cheap prices on drinks and food, and really tasty bar food. The cotton club room is the best!"
5,Listen this is true old school Mexican cooking.  If your on a Diet stick with water with lemon or leave it at the door pick it up on the way out.  We eat here all the time but today was the bomb so good their green mix all green enchilada style OH MAN ITS GOOD staff is always very friendly the owners and her family are very accommodating their menudo is some of the best and not to many restaurants have good menudo this place is very good and you get a lot for your money affordable
5,I'm in love with their pad Thai!
5,"I LOVE Athenian Express. The vegetarian pita with hummus is SOOOO good!! There are tons of vegetarian options, actually, which is awesome. And I love the people there too :)"
1,"I took 2 coats in to be altered. On the first coat only the sleeves were to be shortened. On the second coat the sleeves and the coat length were to be shortened.

We, my daughter (who's coats these were) and I, returned to Tony's a week later to pick up both coats. My daughter tried on the first coat, that only needed the sleeves shortened, and she looked a bit apprehensive and a bit perplexed. But none-the-less she opted to take the coat as she was leaving back to college and needed the coat. When we left Tony's my daughter commented that it didn't feel right in the sleeves, as if it was bunching and it felt uncomfortable to her. I told her to leave it but she insisted that she would need a coat.

The second coat that needed both the sleeves and length shortened was left there because they said it wasn't ready and would be another week. When I returned a week later to pick up the coat it was very visible to me that the job was not done properly. The front of the coat was uneven, I would come to later find out, it was a whole 1/2 inch off. Also, at the bottom of both the right and left sides of the coat there was a zigzag stitch that shouldn't have been there, it should have been a straight stitch. The sleeves also looked as if there was too much lining fabric where it joins the exterior of the coat. From the backside of the coat, at the bottom, the lining was visible (hanging down too far). When I questioned the employee she said her seamstress was gone for the day and to just leave the coat there so she could fix it.

When I returned 2 weeks later to pick up the coat there were no changes made to the coat at all. When I questioned the owner about why the seamstress put a zigzag stitch on the two bottom sides she said that was the only way it could be done to close the coat. I asked why the seamstress didn't go in from inside the lining and she said, ""That would have been too much work"". When questioned why it was still uneven she said it was because it was on the hanger and that once I put the coat on it would be fine. I explained to her that that wasn't the way it was when I originally purchased the coat, that the coat was nice and even at the bottom. She insisted I put the coat on, I told her it wasn't my coat and it wouldn't fit me because the coat belonged to my daughter who was away at college by this time.

By this time I just wanted to take my coat somewhere else to have it fixed but she was insistent on having the seamstress do repairs right then while I waited. I told her no that the coat had already been left there for them to fix and they failed to do anything to fix it in the three weeks since it was originally promised to me. I simply wanted my coat and I expressed that I wasn't going to pay for it because the job wasn't done properly and she grabbed my coat. I then pulled out my cell phone to call the police so that I could get my merchandise back and she proceeded to charge me for the work done, even though it was very clear that I was not satisfied and I was neither confident nor comfortable with leaving my coat any longer. The owner proceeded to tell me to never bring anything to her again and I promised her I wouldn't.

It's been several weeks but I've since had this coat fixed by FIT ALTERATIONS, they did a phenomenal job! I would advise to NEVER take anything to TONY'S CLEANERS AND TAILORS FOR ALTERATIONS. I really don't think the seamstress knows what she's doing."
1,They serve Pepsi.  Got horribly sick about 30 minutes after I finished my meal.
1,"after seeing a recent review about this Safeway it reminded me of the last time I shopped there and it made me never want to go back. 

As I reached the check out line I hear the cashier say out loud ""oh not another customer. C'mon there are other lanes open. How come people keep coming into my lane?""

Now you could make the assumption that he was joking, but I know he wasn't as because a minute later someone got behind me and he again started complaining. 
I just couldn't believe this guy was complaining about having to do his job in front of customers and co-workers. It was really rude and unprofessional.
Look pal, I don't like to go to work sometimes either but I don't sit and bitch about how I don't want to be there. 

Another thing, the Starbucks thing is ridiculous. There is already one in the same complex and then they put one inside the grocery store. Did we really need another one?"
1,"Just left this place after ordering sushi and waiting 1hr20min and left hungry. Food never came with Slow Hand Jack at the sushi bar...tho orders put in after ours were filled. We were given a table meant for 2 and squeezed our threesome in. And to top it off, we were still charged full price for our drinks and soup. LAME! Hana's on 7th Ave is the place to be! Take heed!!!"
1,"Prices were cheap however food was served well after others who came in and they literally put Brown gravy on the Mexican food, staff ignored simple requests...only reason for 1 star was due to price"
5,"I went here last night with a group of my coworkers for dinner.
It's been a long time that we've been to Olive Garden   The food was pretty good and the wait staff was AMAZING.  

We had the following: 
Chianti Braised Short Ribs (it's was ok, the meat was a bit overcooked/dry not juicy, risotto a bit too much salt.  Veggie seemed overcooked).

Braised Beef & Tortelloni (really good, I was told my coworkers would get it again)
Tender sliced short ribs and portobello mushrooms tossed with asiago-filled tortelloni in a basil-marsala sauce. 

Capellini di Mare (really good, didn't smell fishy, pasta was NOT aldente though, a bit overcooked for my taste).

Grilled Shrimp Caprese (pretty good per my coworker, shrimps were not overcooked, pasta a bit overcooked).

But the overall high rating for this place was more of our waiter Craig D.  Can I tell you, we've NEVER had a wait staff being so attentive for our party of 5.  He knew who got what, the timing of our drinks/salad/soups/main meals were on spot, like clockwork.  He made sure our drinks/water was full, the bread was fresh and warm, salad and soup refills even without us asking for more.  He made us feel like we were in a 5 star restaurant, really.  What great service, next time when we're back in town we'd go back again!"
1,This place is the WORST. The older brunette woman behind the counter is not only incredibly rude but she an amazingly small amount of knowledge for all things shipping! I could grab any homeless person off their medication and place them behind the counter and their endless ramblings about the C.I.A. putting a chip in thier brain would make more sence then this older woman. This is the problem with the ups store no two are alike. This ups store is like a private sector version of the DMV! Steer clear!
5,Very cool place. Located right next to Pizzeria Bianco and ran by the same owners (they get their drinks from here for the restaurant). Staff was amazing and the atmosphere was super chill and relaxed. Great place to have a drink under the stars in Arizona. We walked over to have a drink while we waited for our table at the pizzeria and time went by so fast that we weren't ready to go when our table was ready. But staff was so kindly to take our drinks over for us. A must if you're in the area.
1,This place is horrid! They are discriminatory and I will NEVER come back!!!! They are also horribly organized! FAIL!!
5,Brought my car in last weekend for the supreme wash option. I have been going here for years...never a disappointment. My car looks like new and smells great every time. The employees are always courteous and pleasant. Try them and you will be hooked!
5,"I am kind of in love with this place.

The chicken po' boy has haunted me ever since I left Madison back in 2000 - perfect french roll, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and seasoned fried chicken breast = what you need.

Also what you need? an order of dirty rice. And that shit is spicy! Get a soda from the machine out front and walk to Tenny Park. Life is good."
5,I had a broken storm window. They picked it up fixed it and delivered it back to me!!! If you know someone who cannot get to the store and needs stuff good to know. BUY LOCAL!!
1,"I've been here a few times over the course of a couple yrs, trying to give this place a break because I believe in a vital downtown Phx. I continue to be disappointed and can't justify the mediocre food, bad service and most of all, the haughty attitude. The overpricing is just a final slap in the face as you walk out the door. There's just too many other options now to continue to be underwhelmed. I won't be back."
1,"Total and epic fail.

I've attempted to go to this practice twice.
I shoulda learned after the first failed appointment- however, the convenience of their location coupled with my laziness made me go in for a second attempt.
Shame on me I guess.

The first appointment I had with them was ""rescheduled"" about an hour before my appointment to a different day altogether.

The second appointment I had with them was actually made for the Tempe location (when I specifically asked for the Ahwatukee location), and then when I tried to reschedule something- they didn't have anything with a doctor for another month.

Can't imagine actually being sick or super preggo and dealing with these types of issues!  Thus, I'm taking my vagina elsewhere."
5,"I discovered BrandonEyes through word of mouth and I had an incredibly positive experience, which will result in a continuation of my patronage.

PRODUCT: 
First, their product selection is second to none. They have styles for anyone's taste - fun, practical, trendy, high fashion, you name it. As a result of their availability, I was able to find a pair of Ogi drill mounts that fit me wonderfully as well as a pair of polarized Kate Spade sunglasses (non-RX).

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
The optician that assisted me, Ben, has a natural talent for consultative sales. There was absolutely zero pressure involved and he helped me identify two products that genuinely fit my personality, appearance, and lifestyle. I was grateful that he was honest and as a result of his expertise I left with two pairs of eyewear that I can't wear enough.

EYE EXAMS:
I do not have experience with eye exams provided at Brandon Eyes. I usually purchase from an eyewear boutique in Milwaukee (which is where I live). My prescription from my original Doctor of Optometry was still current, but I wanted to try Brandon Eyes. Needless to say, my prescription was transferred (with no complications) to Brandon Eyes and I was able to buy eyewear.

I suggest visiting Brandon Eyes for any eyewear need and ask for Ben, though I am confident that any of the employees will be able to help."
5,"My family and I went to Welcome Diner last night. So, there were several different items ordered and EVERYTHING was so good!  I had the fried avocado po'boy. The bread was toasted the perfect amount. There was a great pico de gallo and kale topping the fried avocado. That fried avocado was amazing! It was so creamy yet crunchy! Yum! My husband had the champion burger. He said it was really good, especially the bacon jam. My brother in-law has the big Jim. It was huge! A biscuit, giant piece of fried chicken and the thickest gravy ever! I tried some and it was so good! Creamy and sinful! The last thing I tasted was the Brussels sprouts. Omg! Goooood! They were crispy and tasty! Only downside was the fries were a little salty. I would definitely go back. The atmosphere is exactly what downtown Phoenix is all about! I loved it!"
5,"Great BBQ, Sauce is great, Cole slaw is good, no complaints for me. It's a BBQ shack, so anybody expecting frills will be greatly disappointed. It's all about the food and that is great."
1,"So we walked into this place around 6pm.. it was SO hot and humid in there it was barely tolerable. After we were sat this baby started screaming and puking all over the mother, the table, itself.. was pretty disgusting. After getting over that the waitress brought over menu and chips and salsa. Took one bite of the salsa, that was it.. out of here. The salsa here is from a can.. tasted like tin with some added cumin. The chips were cold, greasy, stale and soggy form the humidity. Threw a buck in the table and walked out. 

Perhaps its better in the winter time sans the swamp coolers and the puking baby?"
1,"Worst customer service. I opened an account online and went to the branch to make the initial deposit. They don't know what their online banking system is doing and they had to send it to another location in Tucson, this is after I had called yesterday to verify that I could make the initial deposit in my local branch. Get it together! If you are going to have an online system, make sure the branch operations coincide with that! I'm going to cancel my account and do my business elsewhere. Thanks for the headache!"
5,"I had a broken watch band and was looking for a nearby repair place. Doug was great, he replaced the missing pin, tightened up the fit, all while I waited and for a whopping $5. When the watch itself needs repairing, I would not hesitate to go back here."
5,Visit the new website http://www.elyellasalon.com/
1,"It is completely and totally awful.  The food is hideous.  Don't go there, you will thank me."
5,"This place may be out by the mall, but it is one of my favorite places to write in Madison. The staff here are amazingly helpful. The coffee is fabulous (locally roasted), the food is fresh and tasty, and (even though it isnt advertised) they have Gluten-Free bread!!!! :)  They even have a separate meeting/gathering room. Love!"
1,"I have gone to Capital Grille over the years in other locations and have always had a nice experience but the Biltmore location gets a ""D"" in my book!!!!
The bar area and bartender were friendly and attentive :) so that part was great! The dining experience was TERRIBLE!!!!  The waiter was not only very rude, he constantly forgot simple things and was totally unattentive... so after 5 things and 2 hrs into dinner we requested the manager who was just the same and sarcastic on top of everything else! For a $300.00 meal that was average at best. Thank goodness the company I was with was wonderful!!!! Too many other choices to be treated the way we were :( I was so disappointed that I wrote corporate headquarters! To be continued when I hear back from them!!!!"
1,"last time I went here the bartender was more worried about giving his friends shots, eating his food and drinking coffee than to take my order.  when he finally realized me standing there with my money in my hand five minutes later he acted as if i inconvienced him.  Gave him a two dollar tip on a drink, went back up to bar the second time he didn't notice me again, and i got his attention by saying ""hey man i just need an empty glass"" then he walk past me and the empty glasses across from me takes a dudes order who just walked up and grabs a glass after helping him so he oviously heard me."
1,"I would never return to this place. Food is mediocre at best. The interior is sooo small.  The patio is about your only option.

Please go else where for your sushi and Japanese needs.  The cloth napkins alone is a total turnoff.  It leaves lint all over your pants! So cheap!!!

If you want to get a cheap eat, by all means, go there, but don't expect a top notch experience being that it's near the Biltmore."
5,I should have left this review back in November when I stayed here with my parents - every time I look through our vacation photos I think about how much fun I had showing them Madison... and how we enjoyed where we stayed just as much.  Pat and Bob and Happy (their dog) were wonderful and their food was amazing.  They make many of the ingredients on their property (fresh maple syrup anyone?).  Would go back in a heartbeat.
1,"My husband and I found it one Open kitchen. We read the reviews and decided to try it out. We waited 5 minutes before anyone greeted us at the door. The hostess asked us if we wanted the formal dining area or lounge. We chose the lounge. She asked if we wanted a wine list. We said yes. Bread was brought over and that wS the last we saw of anyone for 20 minutes. Finally, I said lets go. My husband went to find the hostess and I guess a manager came and asked if we have been helped. I said no, and he brought someone over. The waiter didn't seem to thrilled to serve us. He had trouble remembering the specials. Not impressed with the service, staff, or food. Won't be going back."
1,"This place attached me with the beautiful copper fountain they have in the front window... It was all down hill from there though. 
The store basically only had tourist junk in it and the employee working was incredibly rude. 
SKIP IT!"
1,"Talk about bad Mexican food.  Stale grocery store taco shells, boiled shredded beef, and the blandest refried beans you've ever had.  The salsa is decent, but that's about it.  Won't be going back."
5,"This big, busy, authentic, smoky, banged up place is a combination bakery, meat market, grocery, deli, & restaurant!  The restaurant serves ala carte items as well as breakfast, lunch & dinner combinations from an extensive menu up over the counter.  On top of that, I asked them to customize my meal, & it was no problemo.

You order & pay at the counter, & they call you when it's ready for you to take to the table of your choice in their big, comfortable dining room.  I asked them to make me up a combination plate with a chile relleno, a beef tamale, plus beans & rice.  They also offered me flour or corn tortillas, & I chose corn.  

Pretty soon my number was called, & here they gave me FIVE roasting hot tortillas wrapped up in aluminum foil!  You help yourself to the salsa bar, & I had the salsa verde, which was so good I didn't even sample any of the others.  In fact, everything was terrific, & the whole meal was amazingly inexpensive at $6.48!

If you want a place that ""looks clean"", this isn't that.  If you want generous portions of really good Mexican food, hop in your Chivy & whip over here ahorita!  This place has tons of character, & the food is very, very good!"
5,"Went there for Valentines day and got the Wild Boar. Good stuff! We were about 20 minutes late for our reservation, but they still took care of us hassle free even though they were busy. It's nice, clean and professional with great food at a nice price. Have not been disappointed after a sufficient number of visits."
5,I gotta say that the food from this restaurant is really good and the service is very nice. I came here and  a lady served me and she also was very attentive. Price is always good when you're student.
1,"I'm in town for a convention and decided to grab a Sub to take back to the hotel room.  This Subway has a great location in the Arizona Center.  It was not very busy.  The staff was friendly and neat. 

I was disappointed when I got back to the room to eat only to discover that the bread either old or left in the microwave to long."
1,I came here the other night and got the WORSE SERVICE EVER. I had a question about my total which was $16. The lady told me that a large pizza with 1 topping was $14 and plus the tax it came out to be $16. It was fine until my brother noticed that the price on the flyer stated a large pizza with 1 topping to be $13. It was a $1 difference and it didn't matter I just wanted to know what I was paying for. The guy in charge came over and told me that my one topping was extra which didn't make sense because I was allowed one topping. I was in mid question when he told his co-worker to just give us the dollar difference. He said it with such attitude and he threw the flyer he had in hand on the floor. He had a horrible attitude and no respect for us as the costumers and because of that I will never come to this Domino's ever again!!
5,"This place is so accidental hipster, and defies categorization. Is it a diner? A bakery? An auntie's living room? Let's just say if a donut shop and a small restaurant played Tetris, this would be the result. 

The eating area is quiet - no music, just the drink cooler humming - and the experience eclectic - mismatched formica tables, plastic cups for water, and tea cups with feet for the Turkish coffee. The Turkish coffee was weaker than expected, but wonderfully aromatized with cardamom. 

There was so much food my eyes pin-balled for a minute. The red lentil soup made with sprouted lentils came in a bowl - a real bowl, not a cup-sized bowl. We also had the gyro plate which was satisfying, and mousaka entree which was like an eggplant, potato, and tomato casserole over yellow rice. By itself, the mousaka would last me two additional meals. We couldn't resist the Boston creme donut, which turned out to be the best I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter. Plus the two coffees, the total came out to be $25 (!!) and some change. 

The service is a relaxed pace, but the owners were charming and seemed to enjoy us enjoying their food. My five-star ratings often depend on how likely and how often I would return, and this place definitely makes the twice-a-month cut."
1,"I stayed at this hotel for a conference and it was terrible! I understand it is an old building but old buildings don't have to be dirty and falling apart. Poor, poor, poor, terrible value for what you pay (on this occasion a ""special"" conference rate of $199). Tiles in the bathroom were chipped, dirty, and in need of repair, the ""art"" on the wall was falling apart inside the frame, the pillows smelled like they were washed in beer, furniture and doors had chipped paint, you can hear your neighbors coughing and taking showers, your skin is scalded in the shower whenever someone flushes the toilet in your wing of the hotel, and there is a story and picture of a rape and murder line up next to the elevator. If that run-on sentence doesn't detract you then look at the rest of the reviews on here-- more than half of them seem like fake 4* ratings and the rest tell the true story and echo my complaints."
1,"i wish i had got his name, but they have an employee in there, white guy, shaved head, he was trying to be kinda smart with me and act like he was above me, kinda like he was competing, now i wore my tank top in there, i am 26 but i look like im 20 and im not trying to act tough, i never do. Anyway i tried to be nice at first, and when explaining my problems (there are about 5 different problems i am having with my brand new stratosphere 2) he would tell me ""well there's nothing we can do about that"", and im like ""well what about all these other problems"" he would reply ""what other problems"" 2 TIMES after ive explained all my problems he says""what other problems"" i said f*** it dude you are an idiot im going to talk to someone else... so i talk to someone else here are the problems im having with the stratosphere 2 in my first two days (mind you i haven't really used my phone these two days because these problems are constant and f***ing annoying):
1. i cant send or receive calls/texts (this happens on and off)
2. if my text is somewhat long people either dont get it or they get a couple words out of the few sentences, just a couple f***ing words sometimes half of a word
3. the calls that do go through, well 75% of the time no one can hear me, i can hear them, they cannot hear me
4.the phone reads my sd card but it wont play my music (the sd card works fine in my stratosphere 1)
5. i cant use my apps, they randomly just exit and im back to the front screen, if i try again it happens again

OF COURSE when i go in to show them the phone starts acting normal, so i cant get a replacement on this f***ing phone that i cant even use, have to keep re trying my calls, miss texts, people dont get my texts or they get a couple words from it AND i cant use my apps, so pretty much nothing on this f***ing phone works, but i cant get a new one....."
5,best place ever and good gumbo and chicken filet
1,"This restaurant is for the rich kids that had never eaten any other fine food in the world other than steaks : ) Pricy steak (cow that is not even organically raised). Salmon that is farm raise(Atlantic). The steak that is almost tasteless. Veggies that are plain but buttery. The server was kind of racist (only asked what my white friend wants to drink, didn't ask me, and then brings me water). The only good thing about this place is the interior itself. The dinner alone was 83 dollars(split amount 3 people). If you have friends that want to get you there please steer them away because both of your stomach and wallet will leave unsatisfied."
1,"A bummer. We had dined at China Chili for several years, but the last experience was a disaster. On Saturday March 15th, my wife and I had dishes we'd loved before, such as chicken with sizzling rice soup and chicken in birds nest (chicken with vegetables with a potato chip like basket).

Within hours, I suffered severe symptoms of food poisoning. Without a day my wife did as well. For the next month, I continued to suffer severe gastrointestinal problems, and remain under a doctor's care. My wife was OK after a couple of days, but this was a nightmare.

This is direct cause and effect. I've never had such severe problems before, and this was the only meal where my wife and I had the same dishes.

I complained to the Maricopa County restaurant examiners, but they weren't interested unless others complained as well. Meantime there is no way I would ever return. I don't need the aggravation."
5,"Good Food, Nice People!"
5,"A completely unexpected find. While on a trip to Madison we wandered into this cafe after checking out the local grocery across the street (it's an odd obsession of ours to check out grocery stores when in a new town). When you're starving and pop into the first place you see, you hope for a sandwich with no mold on the bread and a halfway clean glass for your soda. This was light years beyond that.

I had the special salad of the day. It was delicious, a mixture of greens with just a sprinkling of crunchy celery, and full of huge chunks of the tastiest creamy blue cheese I've had in a very long time. My lunch companion had soup which she declared to also be delicious. 

Decor was a tad dark, and since we were there for a late lunch we were the only ones not sitting alone playing with laptops. However, the tchotkes and lending library helped create a friendly neighborhood hangout feel."
1,"The owner is a total jerk0ff.  I have been in there so many times.  Each time he never comes by to ask how my meal was, yet he goes to other tables.  I am always in a suit so maybe he just doesnt like well dressed people (if you have seen the decor inside, you know what I mean).  It's dingy.  The food is ok---but the owner being a tool and not asking how everything was even once in 8 recent trips made me decide I will never come back ever. he is an idiot."
1,"I'm giving this place one star because yelp doesn't have a half star or no star option.  I lived there for five years.  Now, one might suspect that, well, you lived there five years, you must've loved it!  Oh nay, my friends.  Nay.

I lived there at first, because it was honestly the cheapest place I could find that was in a decent location.  I then was locked into lease agreements I couldn't get out of unless I paid up the wazoo. I will say, being just two minutes from The Biltmore IS quite nice.  However, the apartments themselves... absolutely dreadful.  

In the time I lived there, the management changed hands at LEAST once... perhaps twice.  Anyway, when a change was made, somehow, for some reason, the prices raised as well.  Surprising, as no changes were made to ANY part of ANY apartment home, in ANY section of the complex.  But, I digress...

The place in infested.  I found tons of cockroaches, and finally in the middle of one night, a scorpion.  THAT about did it for me.  And even after numerous phone calls, letters, visiting personally, etc. to tell management about the infestation problems, I NEVER got responses, and the issues were NEVER addressed.  

THEN there's the whole matter of the air conditioning... see, they control when, during the year, you may USE your air conditioning.  And they don't like to let you use it for some reason.  So when it reaches temps of over 90 degrees in late March/early April, which, by the way, means it gets to over 100 degrees INSIDE the apartment, and you complain and complain and complain about it being unfit to reside in... you are not responded to directly.  Instead, they attach a note to everyone's door saying ""we're happy to report you can use your air conditioning in 2-4 weeks!"" ...REALLY??

In addition to THAT!... once able to use said air conditioning, it started leaking, causing water damage to the ceiling, and causing me to have to use a bucket to catch the river of water falling from the ceiling.  After calling their ""emergency"" line numerous times, I would get someone to show up and ""fix"" it.  About a week later, it would start again.  Same procedure.  That probably happened 8 times within 4 months.  By the time I moved out, it still wasn't fixed.  Even after they cut a hole in the ceiling (which they forgot about as the hole was still there three weeks later and I had to physically go to the office and tell them the work wasn't finished), then patched it with ""new"" ceiling... still leaked.  Still had water damage.

Then there's the plumbing.  The kitchen sink would, approximately every 3 months, start to flood and back up into my kitchen.  Mind you, I am a single girl.  Who barely even USES any appliances in her kitchen.  And there would be rotten food that backed up that I had never HAD in my kitchen to begin with... the pipe was connected with the apartment next door.  It was disgusting. This happened so many times, I began to start all my phone conversations/messages to them with ""it's me again!""

The management is slow, rude, uncaring, and only out to squeeze every red cent from you they possibly can.  They're probably STILL after me to pay something.  This is THE worst possible place anyone can live.  It's shameful.  This place makes me physically angry.  But I did learn something from them.  You have to watch out for yourself.  And if you're living in a place that is literally UN-liveable, you should find legal ways to get out of it.  Do not let this place happen to you."
5,"I love Fate! LOVE it. I love Fate so much, sometimes I want to take it behind the school and get it pregnant!

Their green tea milk is AMAZING. I go cuckoo for it. For reals! Their little mushrooms are so good too. Oh my god, they are like little mini mushrooms. If keebler elf's, harvested mushrooms, these would be it! So good! If it's your first time, trust me: get the crab puffs, grab yourself a cool refreshing hulk-alishist Green Tea Milk, and go for the Hong Kong flat noodles. So good! 

And what about those little wafer cookies they give you at the end? They are like air! But better! (...they have calories...maybe they are not like air...but in a perfect world? Like Air!)"
1,Don't go to this store if you are looking for 45s. They give you a book to look through and ask you to tell them what you want and tell you the prices will be $4 upwards. They then price them up using various price guides. If you have found something that is priced highly they hide it then put it on Ebay rather than sell it to you. You do all the work (the books have a total of more than 300 pages) and they reap the benefits. If I hadn't had picked out a certain $300 record that record could have lain there forever. I wasn't even offered it at any price and I would have given them a good price.
1,"I went to Fate because I had been hearing from people for a really long time that it was just a fantastic place and I really should try.  It happened to be right by the Roosevelt where we were actually going to meet up with some of you Yelpers.  You know who you are people.  Hi guys!  It was fun!

We parked and walked up and went inside.  The decor was nice. It seemed to have a decent atmosphere but I am not the type to be suckered in by all that crap.  If a place sucks, I don't care how chic the atmosphere is.  I will call a spade a spade.  

The place wasn't full, quite the opposite really.  Maybe 2 or 3 tables were occupied.  So we go up to the hostess and tell her we'd like a table for two and she says that it'll be about 5 minutes which I am fine with but when I ask her if we can wait in inside she says ""No.  Please wait outside.""  What the fuck is that about?  I could understand if they were super busy and they didn't have any open tables for us to even sit at putting us in the way but if it weren't for the damn techno-look-at-me-I'm-cool music they were playing, you could hear crickets chirping in this joint.  Strike one!  So we go outside and wait.  She comes out after awhile and gives some other people that are waiting some drinks then tells us she'll be right back after she goes and grabs a couple of menus.  They must keep the menus in the parking lot or something because it took her awhile to come back.  

She sits us in this corner that's pretty much hidden away from everything.  So here we are eating in a restaurant that I'm convinced people go to only to be seen and here we are not being seen.  Oh woe is me!  Woe, woe, woe is me!  However will I earn my cool points for the month?

The waitress was very nice and attentive.  I'll give them that but god damn could they keep this place any darker.  I realize it adds ambiance but when you're struggling to read the damn menu it's a little much.  Strike two!

We order a couple of $4 Republic of Teas and the pot stickers then proceed to peruse the rest of the menu.  The variety is somewhat lacking and a common theme is sweetness.  As anyone who knows me will tell you, I don't do sweet.  So I order the Cantonese Dragon Beef and my significant other orders the Szechuan Chicken.

The waitress comes back with the pot stickers.  They sucked.  They were identical to the ones you get at Costco.  They are just like the ones they serve at Casey Moore's during happy hour only there they're free.  Here they cost $6.  I eat one and that's it.  Strike three!

Then comes the entrees.  Decent sized portions.  I can't really tell you if the presentation was good because it was so damn dark in there but I'll just give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.  Mine was in a word, crap.  The best thing you could say about it is that it tasted weird.  I didn't even like the mushrooms.  I am a mushroom fanatic.  If there are two things on a menu that both look awesome and one has mushrooms and the other doesn't, the mushrooms always tip the scales.  But they didn't even save this dish.  I am beginning to think the baseball metaphor wasn't the best route to go as here we are already at strike four.  

So in my disappointment I decide to give my girlfriends Szechuan Chicken a try.  Baseball was definitely not the way to go because we're at strike five now.  

So now my only option is the white rice that came with the dish.  This thankfully was perfectly adequate.  Now if I go to a fucking CHINESE restaurant and the best compliment I can give the food is ""At least they didn't fuck up the rice"", we are in some ugly territory here people.  

If you're looking to go to some hip chic place cuz you want to here the latest spins from DJ Such and such, skip Fate, hit up Hunan Express and then just go straight to Myst or Drift or where ever the shiny shirts happen to be on that given night.  Nuf sed."
5,"It's an amazing theater!! The theater is beautiful and the seats are comfortable.

Advice:

Avoid sitting on row C. Evidently rows A & B were ""under the stage,"" so on row C, we were even with the stage. I've sat on the front row before at other theaters and have never been so close to have to look up. Next time I'll choose seats more toward the middle of the theater.

If you'd like a hot appetizer during intermission, order it before the show."
5,"stimulus overload!!! and i loved every moment of it.  i SO wish i had a store like this near my house.  each isle brought new delights to my eyes.  specialty mexican items everywhere.  my mind was racing with all the things i could make.  unfortunately i'm just visiting and can't haul food home.  

the fresh cheese section was intense, as well as the seafood, meat, produce and hot food booths.  i seriously couldn't make up my mind what to buy and try.  i was in this palace for 1 1/2 hrs!! a grocery store!!  

i ended up with the carnitas burrito which was one of the best i've ever had...and it only had beans, rice and carnitas in it!! no shit.  i also tried the camarones ceviche. coulda used some more limon y chili for my taste, but the fresh avo on top was bombey!!  

the fresh jugo bar was insane.  it was also cool being the only whitie in the building.  this evening, i didn't see one other geras. just me."
5,"Tried the fried tomato sandwich, jackfruit sandwich, fries, and squash blossoms... all absolutely fantastic! We also really enjoyed the biscuit with jam for dessert. Everything about this place was great, there was plenty of parking and it wasn't crowded on a Saturday night. The chef and staff were friendly, funny, and so much fun. The diner lived up to its name and if I had one last/first/only meal in Phoenix it would be here."
5,"This little cafe has turned out to be one of my favorite places to grab a bite while in Phx. My first encounter a few months ago was on a whim. I was slightly hungry and just wanted something quick and healthy before I headed off to do my next massage. Well hello Coronado Cafe. I had been wanting to try this place but just kept passing it by. It is late afternoon and I walk up to the door and it is locked. Ohh well I thought I guess they close after lunch then reopen for dinner. I start to walk away and someone opens the door. The guy explains that they are indeed closed until dinner and would open in about 30 mins or so. Well I could not wait that long or I would be late for my next appointment. He says come on in anyway. What customer service! I just had a quick salad and it was wonderful. I really appreciated the guy doing that for me. 

HINT TO RESTAURANT OWNERS: Customer service is key. 

So I went back a few days later for brunch and had the friendliest waiter...Dan. He is great. I go in pretty regularly on Saturdays for brunch and for a great meal and a little chatting with Dan.

OK back to the food. My brunch consisted of the Crab Eggs Benedict, with a side of roasted potatoes and fruit salad. This is one of my FAVORITE meals ever. They get it right with the texture (big thing for me) and the flavors. They use foccacia bread instead of English muffins. The crab is lump crab meat with a few slices of avocado on top. The hollandaise sauce is creamy and light. Not too heavy. Sometimes this sauce can be made that weighs the dish down. Now I am personally taking a chance on eating eggs over easy but it is so good. I try to be aware of it but sometimes the eggs win and my tummy pays for it later :(

The Farm Salad is awesome. Salty, tangy goat cheese warm and gooey coated with nuts. The strawberries add a little sweetness. YUM YUM

The Portebello sandwich is another favorite. So you vegetarians won't be disappointed here. 

I will say they charge $3 for iced tea. Now that is a bit much especially when you are using crappy Lipton tea. I am a tea lover and don't mind spending that kind of money on tea but it better be fresh tea leaves that I can get a few presses out of.

It is a small place so you will be in close proximity to other patrons. However, I have ended up in a few nice conversations with some very nice individuals. I sometimes come early for brunch and have a whole room to myself to eat, read and chat with my waiter extraordinaire Dan.

Lunch is usually packed here and the wait can be long so keep that in mind and try to go when you can have an executive lunch.

All in all I love CC. It is becoming the equivalent of my neighborhood diner. (All you NY'ers know what I am talking about) The place where you come in and everyone knows you and you have great meal with some great company. I never thought I could have the neighborhood diner experience here in AZ. But Coronado Cafe does just that."
5,"OK, I've literally driven by this place a thousand times, never stopping because I thought it was a scary looking shack and couldn't believe that people actually ate here.

However - after a friend of mine told me that I was crazy and that the food was delicious, I had to try it.  Now I've eaten there three times this week.  

I should also probably mention that I usually hate all things teriyaki - it's disgustingly over sweet and I can't understand why people like it.  BUT this place has it right - it's fresh, not out of a jar, and made by the sweetest people you'll ever talk to.  Try a chicken bowl with extra veggies and brown rice - you won't be disappointed.  And don't forget to order an eggroll - they're amazing and they come with this ridiculous ginger sauce that'll leave you craving more."
5,"Went there not knowing what I was in for.  I made an appointment same day and had Ka cut my hair.

He was exceptional and I am very fussy.

He took his time, listened closely to what I was looking for and nailed the cut.

He is quiet, soft spoken and very nice.

Most importantly he does an excellent job of cutting a guy's hair.

And for $15.00 you can't ask for anything better.

I went to an expensive ""salon"" in Madison and the woman did a crap job.  I paid 1/2 the price at this spot and Ka was awesome."
5,"these guys are super friendly. the food was made perfectly! mushroom and Swiss.yum
they play nice music and its very clean"
5,"I freaking hate name changes!  This will always be AWA to me.

This is my place all summer for Phoenix Mercury games.  We love loud it can get in here.  Players have said that this is one of those arenas where the crowd definitely becomes the X Factor because the volume on the court can get more intimidating than some other Arenas.  As it should be.  

I've seen lots of other concerts/events here too over the years and it can go from feeling like a small casual place, like during the AND1 Basketball Tour to an upscale ""adult"" spot, when Billy Joel played it, to a rocking explosion - Melissa Etheridge rocking the place down.  This place does a great job of just ""matching"" the appropriate mood of the night.  

While the food stuffs are generally open for the Sports events, there are some nice options. The Copper Club has some nicer options, though still quite casual.  There is a new wood fired pizza place that is actually really good.  Of course you've got Subway, McDonald's and Cold stone too.  

It's a great spot for any event.  Personal opinion though - if you are going for a sport event you have to sit in the bottom 1/2.  There is such a huge difference in the seating that it's absolutely worth it - even if you're in the last row on the level."
5,$5 for a flaming D P. Great deal and delicious. Patio seatings the way to go when enjoying happy hour. Also a great place to watch games. Great investment Mikey Bidwell
1,"Monkeys could do a better job.  The staff do not think about what they are doing or what is important to the car, only follow a checklist"
5,"Yet another phenomenal meal. Had the Dragon Eggz which were tangy as ever. Also tried the Turtle Island Crab, which is literally a deconstructed won ton. Just brilliant. And the perfect thing to have during the awful Phoenix summer!

For dinner I ordered the Temple of Fire, and they weren't joking. It would be nice if they wouldn't pound the chicken flat as a pancake, though! Cook the whole thing and cut it up, instead! Pounding a chicken flat makes it tough. 

The service was stellar as always. Our server was cheerful, and on point."
1,"Terrible. For a city so lavishly seasoned with some of the best Mexican food on the planet, this place coulnt have been worse if it tried. Outdated, dingy, dining space and help. I love me a good hole in the wall, but Jordan's can't even hit that mark. Avoid it!!!"
1,"Worst experience ever! Just how long does it take to cook 2 burgers? We ordered 2 burgers, very simple burgers and after more than 30 minutes waiting, the server came to us saying ""your food is coming!"" After 15 more minutes, we decided to leave. I am honest and I wanted to pay for the 2 beers... 10 minutes to get the change! The server came to me ""Why didn't you wait 5 more minutes? Your food was ready..."" Yeah right. The manager? Obviously more preoccupied to make the pretty servers laugh... Pathetic and unprofessional."
1,"This is the original Macayo's and man has it seen better days. The decor is old. The carpeting is tired. The plates are chipped and scratched up. The service is crap and the food is NOT what it is at other Macayo's around town. It took our server 10 minutes to come and get our drink order. One member of our party ordered a Coke and it was totally flat. It took her another 10 minutes to replace it.  I had a chicken taco and the chicken tasted canned. The server spilled salsa all over the table and took forever to come back to clean it up. One member of our party ordered a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style and got a beef and green chili burrito with verde sauce...and then our server seemed befuddled when we asked for her to replace it with what we actually ordered.

Honestly, I have eaten in better dive-Mexican places than this Macayos. Definitely skip this spot."
1,"greeter which is basically security was the coolest dude there, they have hardly any wireless routers and when you ask somebody a question they are always in a hurry to get away from you to go on break i would not return to this location at all"
1,"I have received a letter from the zoo apologizing (and a refund) for the rude employee. I am not satisfied in that I felt like I wasn't believed that the employee used derogatory remarks in front of my child but I will never return to this Zoo again, will tell everyone the experience I had let people know that if you have children then going to the Phoenix Zoo is not a great idea since you might be called a bad name in front of young ones."
5,One of the best bakeries in town! Try the German Cholate cake for a real treat.
1,If you like to be followed around like a dog to buy overpriced cigars that are very DRY. This is the place for you. 15 plus years selling wholesale cigars so I would know. Buy one put it in your humidor for a month and enjoy!
1,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. I have lived here for 2 years now and cannot believe the terrible service that they provide to their residents. I have had to ask multiple times for the closet in my guest room to be fixed (it is now broken again because they didn't fix it properly the first time. They never admit that they missed something the first time and I had the same problem with the guest toilet. Their website for paying rent is terrible. Why would I only want to pay for the utilities instead of the entire bill? Thanks to their system that doesn't understand what ""full amount"" means, they were trying to charge me late fees when I have paid my bill in full and early every month for 2 years. Their office hours are so terrible that I couldn't even talk to them when they finally delivered the message and had to wait until 10am on a weekday when most normal people are at work to try to talk to someone. I would NEVER recommend this apartment to ANYONE."
1,"There are a lot of positive reviews about SP, but I have to give a negative review due to some pretty bad customer service. 

I had purchased an old vintage bike and asked for a full overhaul. No problem, they said have it ready in two days. Went in to pick up the bike and they said they were slammed and did not get to work on it. 

No Problem. 
A week after that and it was not done. 
Another 3 weeks after that and it was not done. 
Another weeks goes by and its not done. 

Having not received one phone call, I finally just go in and ask for the bike. 

I was told that they were waiting on some brake pads and a 28"" x 1 1/2"" tube which, they claimed were both extremely difficult to find. The brake pads perhaps, they were different, but the tube? I bought one the same day just around the corner. That was disappointing.

Now, they did seem to do a good job overhauling the bike and they only charged me for part of the job since I took it before they could finish.

Yet, after 6 weeks of waiting, not receiving one phone call, and some condescending attitudes, I was ready to take my bike back and try another avenue. 

It seems like a cool place, but this was really a bad experience. Two stars for their work, zero for service.

[Edit]

I meant to add this just after I wrote the entry. I had stated above that I understood it may be difficult to find the brake blocks needed for a rod actuated system. This was to give Slippery Pig the benefit of the doubt with regard to why they needed to keep my bike for 6 weeks (and who knows how long it would have taken to get it back had I not walked in there and demanded it back unfinished). 

Well, it took me the better part of half an hour to find a place that would ship the brake blocks to me within 3 days using the advanced technique of the Google search engine. 

Now, there are two excuses Slippery Pig could use in their defense, they just didn't care, or they are incompetent. I think a little of both are involved. Because of this, I am downgrading my review from a 2 to a 1, and will never being taking a bike back there."
5,"Pricey but so worth it.  Asked our waiter for cheese suggestions and they always hit a homerun. The wines are always good, service is great and food is incredible."
1,Gotta agree with Kelli H.   Bucks Pizza used to be really good.  Now it's borderline terrible.   Don't bother with it.
1,"be warned!!!


from my experience if you bank with arizona federal you are opening yourself up to losing your money, potential identity theft, and many days full of frustration while you ""become one of them"".  

* outdated technology- hard to find information on their website and limited self service capabilities
* contacting a live person will take up to 5 minutes!
* fees applied incorrectly and excessively by arizona federal
* problems can only occur from monday - saturday 9 am to 3pm * criminals welcome to take all the customer's money in the evenings and during the weekends
* rude customer service agents that do not respect ""members""
* ""be one of us"" brainwashing slogan should really say, ""if you are stupid, rude, and like other people stealing your money and being blamed for it, then join arizona federal and ""be one of us!"""
5,Cheuvront's is a gem.  Their wine selection is superb and their cheeses are tough to trump.  I have always been treated to wonderful service and taste treats.  I also love that they have such a wonderful champagne by the glass selection.  The Laurent-Perrier is by far the best and I love that they have it in splits.  Always something to look forward to when traveling to Phoenix.
1,"Should have listened to the numerous negative reviews on-line (and there were many) but we trusted Guy from Diners, Drivins & Dives ...BIG MISTAKE. 

Clue #1 Strip mall with huge cheesy banner boasting ""Food Network"" endorsement. Clue #2  Self serves sign-in waiting list, apparently, the slimy owner was too busy gushing over customers trying to eat but steering clear of unhappy ones.  Misters and drinking water would have been a nice touch to make the 10-20min 104 degree wait more bearable. 

The minute we saw the paper table cloths and plastic chairs,cups & utensils we were in trouble. One waiter frantically tried to service the whole restaurant, which was a complete zoo. Now according to Triple D, the pasta was homemade....aaaaaah.....not so much.... Ive been to Italy, I know the difference.  

Cut to the chase, $27.00 for two a la carte / appetizer sized entrees.

Seems to me, his only goal is cashing in on the TV appearance as quickly as possible with no concern to repeat business...

Don't waste your time and money....On a positive note, Guy was right about Matts Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix, great good and the best costumer service we've ever had."
5,"Best Mexican food we've found so far. Great bakery, sometimes they have trays of what I call Mexican sliders. Small round sandwiches, one has ham, a sliced jalapeno pepper, and shredded cheese. If you order the fish dinner it comes with the head on. Very tasty. Meats you won't find anywhere else, cabeza, lengua."
1,"Their miso soup was cold and SPOILED. They made us another batch that was actually hot and no longer tasted a few days old, but still nasty. Their teriyaki chicken was also salty."
5,"Ditto to all the praises below. Awesome prices, friendly staff, huge selection. 

The 1st time at Ryan's can be a little freaky, don't be afraid though. When you 1st walk into the warehouse, you will immediately have the feeling of ""I think I'm somewhere I shouldn't be..."" ignore that feeling and just keep walking :)"
5,"I cannot RAVE enough about this company! My son got the mumps and had to be isolated  the last week of school. We had to do alot of last minute changes re: packing up, shipping and storing his stuff. I must have spoken to Lazy Bones 10 times during that week and they could not have been more accommodating, They made this as painless as possible for me, telling me exactly where to get the boxes and shipping supplies (they set up very convenient places right off campus), re-scheduled my pick up time to accomodate me, and told  me they would ship the remainder of my son's stuff home so I did not have to worry about it. We live in California and received the boxes in 4 days! In addition, every time I called they asked about my son and if there was anything else they could do to help. I HIGHLY recommend them and we will be customers for the entire time my son goes to school in Wisconsin. Oh, and their laundry service is awesome too!  Truly a great company with excellent customer service! 5 stars all the way!"
1,"This business closed in early November with no notice.  Voicemail said that clients that had purchased packages would be contacted for refunds by the end of November, but I haven't been contacted about my unfulfilled pedicure package.

However, I have located the owner of Salon 3121, Michelle Davis and she is now doing business at:

Nails by Michelle D
3240 East Camelback Road Studio #4
Phoenix, Arizona 85018

If you are awaiting a refund from Salon 3121, you can try contacting Michelle and see if she'll make good on your prior purchase.  Not sure if she's selling any new packages, but I'd be careful about advanced purchases.  Good luck."
5,"Here on business, staying at the downtown sheraton across the street from the restaurant. I've been here twice this week and the food and service have been great. Chips and salsa are a unique blend of sweet and salty and delicious. Great margaritas. Both I can only comment on the fajitas but they are amazing. I'd definitely recommend"
1,"My friend and I walked in this store the other day. The store had at least 7 employees standing around and talking with each other. We were not greeted or asked anything..We were completely ignored. After about 10 minutes, Enough time for me to explain the differences between phones to my friend. We looked around and still no help. So we left I looked at one group of associates and said thanks for your help in deciding what store not to come back to. She just smiled and said have a nice day!"

1,"What did I just eat?

I'm not 100 percent sure.  I've been all over America and I've had sausage gravy over biscuits just about everywhere.  I've been down South and had amazing sausage gravy.  I had really, really good sausage gravy at a Motel 6 in Custer, South Dakota (no lie!).  I've had passable sausage gravy and biscuits all over this great land of ours...but what I just ate at the Dairyland Family Restaurant comes nowhere close to being sausage gravy and biscuits.

The gravy itself was passable as gravy.  Lifeless and sad, but gravy.  The biscuit chunks in the gravy was where things start to go awry.  They were all uniform in size and shape (warning!) and they tasted not like sausage, but more like something that was killed out behind the dumpster last night.  Maybe it was raccoon sausage.  

The biscuits themselves are where the whole train truly derails.  They actually served that slop over freakin' Pillsbury, out-of-the-can, cook 'em yourself at home biscuits!  That, my friends, is unforgivable.  If I want that crap, I'll stay home and cook it myself.

On the plus side, the service was good.  The eggs were fine.  And the Pepsi I drank was sweet and perfectly carbonated.  

The decor of the place looked straight out of 1985 and desperately needs some updating.  

The price would be reasonable--if they had given me decent food.  At the price I paid for what they gave me, I feel a tad overcharged.

I'm not going back.  Madison is a big town.  You can do much, much better."
5,"Great and has been for years.  Lines out the doors at lunch but worth the wait.  I recommend combo 'K'

1,"I have lived in Phoenix for 20 years, have always heard good things about Honey Bears, and have meant to try their Q for a long time.  Greatly, greatly, disappointed!

I went there on a Saturday a little over one month ago.  I ordered a slab of ribs, beans, slaw, and sweet potato pie to go [wanted peach cobbler, but they were out].  I was really looking forward to some good ribs.  I arrived to pick-up my order and there was a line of three parties ahead of me at the cash register.  No big deal until the sassy young lady at the register spent 15 minutes talking and checking out the first person in line.  While I stood getting frustrated from waiting so long to just pick up food, the second and third parties in front of me left because they too were tired of waiting.  

When it was finally my turn, I mentioned to the young lady, ""do you realize that two parties in front of me walked out because they were tired of waiting""?  When I said this, an older lady that appeared to be the manager stopped dead in her tracks as she was walking by.  She asked the young lady at the cash register what was going on.  The young lady stated that I told her two parties had just walked out because they were tired of waiting.  The manager said, ""oh"" and went on about her business like it was no big deal.  When I paid my bill, the young lady stated, ""your food is over there,"" pointing to the other end of the counter about 6 feet away.  I asked if there was extra sauce with my meal and she told me extra sauce is always included with ribs.  

I get home with my order and am ready to chow down on some ribs and the first thing I notice is there is no extra sauce with my meal as I was told.  I opened up the plate of ribs and was quite surprised when I took a bite.  I think these ribs may have been walked past the smoker at some point, but that is about all.  No smokey flavor, no smokey color, just a big disappointment.  The beans were very good, the slaw appeared to be a premade product, and the potato pie was o.k.  However, I really wanted the cobbler they had on the menu but were out of.  

I admit that I am a BBQ junkie and have high expectations of such food.  But I had heard such high reviews of Honey Bears and these ribs were so bad.  I honestly ate half of the slab and tossed the rest in the trash.  I paid ~$30 dollars for this single meal and was insulted by the treatment of their staff.  I will never walk through their door again..."
5,Great Manicure
5,"My husband surprised me with a little getaway for my birthday and a wonderful stay at the Speckled Hen Inn B&B. We have some experience with B&Bs and this one is very nice. The Innkeepers are friendly, kind, and like others have said, not overbearing. It's located on a small farm that has sheep, llamas (or they may have been alpacas), chickens, a very cute dog named Happy, and some outdoor cats. The farm house where the guests stay is tastefully decorated. There is a nice living area and a library area where you can lounge about. There is also a mini kitchen you can use, if needed, with snacks. Our room was a very good size and it was neat and clean. We had a tv and dvd player with movies to choose from. I also noticed how nice and quite it was. 4 of the 5 rooms were filled while we were there and yet it was always very quiet in our room. The breakfast was wonderful! The owners are very good cooks and served us 2-3 courses for breakfast. Some of the food we ate, like the eggs and some fruits were straight from the farm. Free WiFi was another convenient bonus. If you're looking for a romantic getaway I would highly recommend staying at the Speckled Hen Inn!"
1,"Do not take your vehicle if you value your sanity and your money. This was the worst auto repair experience I've had and if I never have another experience like this one, it would still be too soon for me."
1,"This place is very bare bones and the staff is not friendly at all.  When you go to a place like this, you expect that English is a second language - but find it so incredibly rude when the staff talk to each other in their own language, laugh and smirk at you while they are doing your nails.  It is so insulting and rude and you cannot help but to think they are saying bad things about you.  I feel fairly confident that the staff knows English yet they pretend not to understand you - and don't even bother to try to get to know you.  If you ask them a questions about a nail design or color, they have no opinion and can offer no advice.  They offer nothing more than a manicure and pedicure - definitely do not go the extra mile in any way.  They ask the same question when you come in during the day ""You working today?""  What does it matter if I am working or not?  And even if I tell you, you pretend not to understand me - and if you seriously don't understand, why ask??  Drives me crazy.  I have been here several times - the only reason  - it is close to my house and there is always someone available.  After this last time, I have decided to go elsewhere - my polish started peeling after two days and my nails were filed and buffed so thin they started cracking.  I have had it!  The work is hit or miss but mostly miss.  Even the entertainment is pathetic - the magazines are YEARS old - they even stock free advertisements you get in the mail, the TV does not have good reception and is always showing a lame show, the massage chairs have seen better days and the staff is just so rude - constantly talking and clucking in their own language to each other and laughing.  There are too many other salons in the area that are just as convenient - time to try a new place for me! I would not recommend this place unless you are desperate!"
5,"Friendly staff, and a great scratch free car wash at an awesome price!"
5,"Amazing place! Love it here! What's with the bad reviews? Are you kidding me? 

Best burgers in the Madison area, hands down. Perfect fruity drinks. Great service!  

bottom line: awesome!"
5,"In my opinion, almost all restaurants in the Madison area are bland. People may hate me for thinking it, but I don't care. There's no spice, little flavor, and it's gotten to the point where I just don't really go out, because I'm sick of wasting my money on mediocre food.

It got to the point where I thought my tastebuds were dying.

Enter Monty's Blue Plate. I had the meatless loaf sammich, and it was awesome, though it tasted nothing like meatloaf. The waffle fries? delicious. The dipping sauce? Don't even think of stealing a dip. I will bite you.

There was so much I wanted. I will be back, perhaps tomorrow. I will find excuses to wander to the east side, then say ""While I'm here, I might as well hit Monty's"".

All-in-all, Monty's is making my life better. Thank you Monty's."
1,"We ordered wings, boneless, Buffalo. Just a little bit before happy hour ended. We decided not to get pizza and do pasta and a sub.  We got our ""wings"" which were black, round little crispy balls of dry chicken with Italian dressing g with some hotsauce mixed in drizzled on top. I couldn't chew them so I sent them back. When we got our new wings they looked a million times better. They were golden and smothered in some of the same weird sauce. These were still partially frozen. I didn't bother sending them back for fear they'd spit in my raviolis. My boyfriend ordered a Philly I ordered raviolis.  His sandwich was sub par. He said it was just some beef, melted processed provolone cheese on a dry sesame bun. Bummer, then my raviolis were big and round, the filling was nearly flavorless, obviously frozen and processed swimming in some sauce that was as tick as ketchup with a taste to match. We waited a long time between refilled and when they asked how my food was I told them it was gross. She left it at the table and brought the check about ten minutes later. With the wings and ravioli included! We wont be going back...to any of this chain and I dont recommend it. If you want a NY slice and some yummy wings go to pats pizza plus. Its a dive half the price and twice as good."
5,Ducked in just to find a cool place to sit and a bite to eat. The efficient waitress brought out the BEST burger I've ever had.  And I've eaten lots if burgers in my 54 years.  A big juicy patty on a sweet Hawaiian style bun. They had a couple of burgers but I don't remember this one's name-- All Star Burger?  Anyway it was a great experience.
1,"I have avoided this place since it opened, but a friend insisted we meet up there for dinner.  First thing I noticed was the dirty fork in my silverware set.  It had definitely gone through a dishwasher, which baked on a nice chunk of food from the previous user.  Pointed it out to the waiter who just swapped out my silverware set with some from a nearby table.  After that, I needed a drink.  Ordered a Bud Light Lime since there was a huge banner that said $2.50 for that brand all during May.  Nope, they were out and the waiter said we could NOT substitute for another drink (i.e. a Corona or something similar).  Ok then, I'll just order a $9.39 mushroom and swiss.  Food came and the fries were cold.  Told the waiter we wanted new fries and he obliged.  The burger was nothing special.  Should have been half the price we paid.  Then, after I'm half way done with the burger, the waiter returns and says he checked with the manager and we could get a Corona for $2.50.  Too late.  By this time, I just wanted to leave.  The place was not busy at all, I'm not sure what took him so long to check with the manager about that.  I hate these theme restaurants and this trip just served to solidify my beliefs that gimmicky restaurants usually do not have good food.  I'll stick with 5 Guys or Nitty Gritty when I want a good burger.  Hell, just go next door to TGIFridays, even they beat this place."
5,Great food!  Service was quick and staff was nice!  Very authentic mexican food and some of the best tamales I've had!  Definitely try the green tamales!
5,Bravo! This place aced it for me. I always like to read what people order at places to help me decide. I guarantee that anything you order here will be amazing and delicious. Great job guys!! Makes me happy to see a spot like this in Phoenix. Reminds me of Portland. Things are lookin up for the foodie scene.
1,"Wlaked into this place and the guy comes out right away, and asks what I need. I tell him, and right about then his cellphone rings. He spends the next 5 minutes on a personal call, without acknowledging me once (""be right with you"", ""sorry about this"", etc). All I did was walk into his store and try to do business with him, so I can certainly see how a personal call should take precedence. This place must have all the work they can handle-- try someplace where they value your business."
5,"Before I booked here, i was about to stay at a crappy hotel off the highway that look like it was about to fall apart. I just happen to browse online on priceline and got this place book. I was already happy at this point that I am staying at a Marriott because I have always had great experiences at all the Marriotts across the country, but what happens next makes me love this location even more. I am extremly happy I didnt let some of the previous reviews deter me from booking here. When i arrived, my check in process was easy, the front desk was friendly, and I was able to check in early (which I was on a 16 hour drive cross country so i was ready to rest). My room was clean, the bathroom is immaculate, and it had everything i needed. Even the smallest things such as hair dryer, ethernet wire, and the ginger orange smell hair products made this stay VERY pleasant. I wanted to bring my work computer up to my room and the front desk gentleman was very helpful in assisting me with all my questions and helping with the cart so i can take it upstairs. When I travel, I dont expect hotel staff to wait on my hand and feet and I am not a needy guest, as long as they are professional and willing to help when i ask for it, I am satisfied with my stay. I asked for a different coffee maker since it wasnt working and they brought me another right to my room within a few minutes, thats what i call attentive and prompt service. All in all, I highly recommend this Marriottt."
5,"ok ok , i have to say the best taco's i'm sorry but i can eat this all day no joke add a coke to that please ;]"
5,"This is a frequent dining spot for me. There are not to many options in downtown Phoenix, however this place has a great variety. I am not a sandwich gal or a fan of deli's though Paradise Bakery has a great variety on their menu to offer for all types of eaters. Everything is fresh. They have daily soup options and tasty crisp salads to go. As far as the deserts (cookies, brownies, etc) All I can say is YUMMY! 

The staff is always friendly. The management team is always upbeat and greets all visitors who walk through the door. 

There is indoor and outdoor seating. This place gets busy so they offer call in to go orders. 

For a healthy option this is the place to go."
5,"The service was great and we were their during first Fridays! I love the wine selection
and the food was wonderful , I love the cheese plates and the salmon salad was to die for.The bread pudding was also very good. I have been to some of their wine tastings and for the price it is a great deal! If your going to one of the sporting events downtown
I would definitly recommend Cheuvronts!"
1,"Bad. Very bad. Ordered a combo: sour cream enchilada, taco and tostada. The shredded beef in the taco was harder than jerky, the enchilada was an oily mess and the tostada was soggy. 

You can tell a lot about the type of food you are going to have by the salsa. True to form, the red sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce and the chunky sauce was about 80% jalapeno and no flavor.

There was a strange smell in the restaurant and I couldn't wait to leave.

I will not be back"
1,"My wife called Zee Best and, after her 3rd conversation with the owner, John, was able to get a quote to have a townhouse occupied by tenants cleaned. We explained we have a coupon from their website. The quote was for 4 rooms, a hallway and a stair case and was between $125-150 (each room was $15 and the coupon, which I have saved off of their website says that pre-treatment is included). John also reassured us that the price would be the same as in years past (we've used them for 3 consecutive tenants), except that there is a $10 trip charge they've recently started charging. 

On the day of the cleaning (the following day), the technician who visited the townhouse called me and told me the price would be $195. I explained to him that we had a quote of $125 to $150 and that in years past the cost was $115 (so we expect the cost will be $125). The technician told me that the price of $125 is accurate, but there is $70 of pre-treatment, which was a deal (he told me it would normally be 700 ft at $.20). I explained that the coupon says pre-treatment is included and when he said it wasn't, I told him that I am sorry but that is not what I was quoted and he should go home. The technician then asked me ""well what are you willing to pay""? He was clearly upset and told me at least twice that he just drove 40 miles. I explained that it isn't my fault that they service an area so far from the trucks or that his boss drastically misquoted the price. He then asked me if I'd pay $180, ""no"", how about $170, ""no"", how about $160, ""no"", how about $150, ""fine"". At that point I wanted to stop arguing with him as all of this was occurring with my brand new tenant (2nd day in unit) present as he took the day off of work to be home with the technician. I figured I'd call John after, explain to him that we had paid $115 each of the previous 2 years, and that we could just adjust this to $125. 

When I called John, I got basic belligerence. He first told me that he asked my wife how dirty the carpet is. Not sure what that means, but that was never asked. Plus the quote was $125-150 with an assurance that it would be the same price as last year plus $10. When I attempted to reason with John, he called me a liar (re: what the coupon on his website says), my wife a liar (re: her statement that he never asked how dirty the carpet was) and never responded to why the cost wasn't the exact same as previous years, plus $10 like was quoted. John wouldn't let me speak and just spoke over me, stating he never should have quoted me (with which I agreed). The carpet was in the exact same shape (several stains) as it was after previous tenants. Zee Best couldn't remove the stains in years past and I didn't expect them to this time (which they didn't). I just wanted a clean carpet (i.e. no dirt) for my new tenant. The conversation ended with John finishing yelling at me and promptly hanging up.

The cleaning was average at best and the hassle and renegotiation makes it a no-brainer to avoid this company."
5,"Best place to go when you are feeling blue!

As a fresh new transplant to the area who knows absolutely no one besides her beyond retired neighbor who hits the pillow by 4pm, I often find myself slightly lonesome.  Instead of watching another episode of entourage, I decided to see if you yelpers were right....THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!

Not only were my new Mexican friends staring at me because I was the only white gal in sight, but probably because I was beaming from ear to ear!  From the outrageous meat section to the beautiful bakery I think I could easily spend a whole day there.  The store was extremely easy to find and for a whopping $1.88 I left with a gigantic cucumber, 2 over-sized oranges and at least 2lbs of grapes!  

Great place, cant wait to go again!"
1,"In a way I'm not surprised because the people working there was snooty all too often and, MJ's business hours were erratic at best. Worse; I stopped by there a couple of times since their 'Open' sign was lit but the place was closed."
1,"Before I jump into this review, let me just preface it by saying that I'm really not a fan of chain restaurants (Chipotle, Jersey Mike's and Yogurtland excluded). And in my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory embodies everything I hate about chain restaurants. 

Right off the bat, our server was rude and disinterested. And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once. 

I ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta. 

When the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory. And if you happen to be looking for dinner at the Biltmore, I would suggest you stop ANYWHERE else."
5,Always get the shredded pork to go with coleslaw and beans to make my own BBQ salad at home. Geat BBQ 25cent wing night on Mondays..grilled!
1,"This place is like the equivalent of The Clubhouse, in Tempe, but in Phoenix. The layout makes no sense, and the character of the building is incredibly, old and out dated. Especially with as many good acts and money they bring in, its time to reinvest your money to renovate/improve. They pull in great acts but almost always the venue pushes me away from seeing them. Not worth it."
1,"Was here for a gala at the adjoining conference center.  Service was terrible. The waitress kept slamming food and drinks on the  table. She only brought dinner for half the table and the rest had to wait for 15 minutes. One of the guests had to wait about 20 minutes for the meal. Horrible!
I've been to many Marriotts before and hold a frequent visitor card, but this one has been the worst experience so far.

I know this isn't a review that completely reflects the hotel or any restaurants inside it, but the fact that this service was under the Marriott name prompted this review and rating"
5,"Recently had outpatient surgery here (septoplasty & turbinate reduction - sinus work), and the whole experience was top-notch. Always felt well taken care of and in the hands of professionals. Everyone was very friendly, explained everything well, efficient, empathetic, etc. Wouldn't hesitate to return."
1,"BEWARE!! 

I had my car serviced here. Before leaving, the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was showing no signs of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for approximately one hour. I then drove from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes. 

Shortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. Then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town. When examining my car, the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine. 

Photos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted (cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic); including three images showing the coolant fill neck and the cap. The other photo showed the hood liner wet from the coolant that came out. Due to the short amount of mileage that was driven, the car thankfully became operable once radiator coolant was filled and the cap placed back on. Based on the photos and a licensed mechanic's evaluation of my car, it is apparent that the Pep Boy's mechanic removed the radiator cap from my vehicle and failed to secure it back onto the radiator fill neck. However, the store manager, Jae, informed me that since I drove my car a few miles ""it must have vibrated off after service."" 


I may be a female, but I know that the caps have locks, AND that I have 136K miles on this car and no cap has ever ""vibrated off"" while driving. Thanks for the advice. Really. I sent both photos, reciepts, and letters to Jae. He was unwilling to admit any fault. Go somewhere else for work on your car. Hopefully there are other shops are more helpful and honest."
1,"If you are looking for tasteless Mexican this is your place.  Besides no flavor, the dishes don't come with any garnishes such as sour cream or guacamole. I had a chicken tostada except there was barely any chicken and was about five inches in diameter. My husband had a Chile Relleno and Two Tostittos plus a coke. No rice or beans and our bill was $28!"
5,"This woman is the best in town, but she is semi-retired so her hours are a bit infrequent. She is slightly more expensive than other places in town, but is totally worth it!"
1,"Unless you are looking for drinks, save your money. Area was rundown, shop area had empty shelves and limited selection of sizes, and the fun was average.

Decent for drinks or watching sports but don't make a mecca for this place. The big unit I had was below average. Bun was hard. Hot dog was flavorless and chilli was bland."
1,"Only thing less disappointing then the food is the staff.   Ordered Chin Wings, Hot & Sour soup and Sesame Chicken to go.. What I get in return is Chin Wings with the wrong stir fry sauce, a cup of hot & sour and lemon chicken.  They charged me for what I ordered, yet they still refused a refund me or to replace my food.. Avoid this place like the plague."
1,"Blow it out. The party's over. This candle has flickered and the flame has gone out. Wax on. Wax off. Closed. And for anyone who caught my stand up, yes indeed, I have purchased tapered candles here."
5,I love this place our waitress Sara Jane was awesome I will be coming back.
1,Employees too concerned with chatting behind the counter other than offering to help you.
5,"Grilled potstickers, moo shu pork, cashew chicken. Yum!!"
1,"So I dropped off tow shirts a few days ago for dry cleaning.
I ask the guy how much and he said 6.95 and I have to pay when I pick em up.
Picked up the shirts today and the total was $13.90
The 1st and last time I went to Maroney's.
Those guys should be in the money laundry business IMHO."
1,"Nice people, but when you take in 3 pairs of $150 jeans to have them shortened and they say yes we can keep the original hem apparently they think that means to cut off the original hem and stitch the alteration as close to they originally looked as possible. Everywhere else in the world that's called matching the stitch (which is usually cheaper) but not keeping the hem. Two totally different things and matching stitching isn't worth $10 per alteration. One last thing, they didn't even match the thread color and width well. Original is a faded yellow and they used a shiny bright yellow. Looks totally sloppy.

They refused a refund and said they would fix it at the same price with the actual hem... If we went through a box of a ton of alterations scraps and matched it. Total scam artists. Too bad cash was paid or they would be getting a challenge from my credit card. 

I found them by yelp and hopefully other people consider this review before giving these dishonest business people any money."
1,"I was having lunch today with two business executives.  I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad which seemed simple enough. When it was served I began to eat it and noticed there was no chicken.  I politely asked if I had ordered wrong and she said ""no"" the chicken might be on the bottom. I checked, no chicken. I again brought it to her attention and she said she had to show the kitchen to be sure that I was correct.  She then proceeds to take my salad that I had been tossing around to the kitchen
.  They  go through it and she brings the same salad back saying ""yea, you were right they forgot it, they laughed and added some for you"". I would have thought they would have made a new one not played with mine and add chicken to fix it.  I chose not to eat it after others have handled it. I didn't want take it further  because I was with others.  But.... Cheesecake, I was embarrassed enough for us all. Worst service ever!  And an attitude I was shocked by!  I  sure the other people I was with will not return there anytime soon. There are a lot of great places to go at the Biltmore and Cheesecake if no longer one of our choices."
1,"I really don't even know where to start with this place.  I've lived in Central Phoenix for 8 years and have always heard about how great this place was.  That's the only reason I didn't turn around and walk out upon entering.  The decor in this place is cluttered, old, and feels dirty.  They sell most of their ""decorations"" and if you are looking for a basket from 1984 you will surely find one. The floors, the tables, the walls - everything just looks old and worn.  I don't find that particularly appetizing.  

So I figured, this place must make one hell of a sandwich to keep such a high reputation, and placed my order.  While very nice, the staff is s...l...o...w...  

I ordered the briesciutto.  I figured brie, prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes - can't mess that up, right?  Wrong.  The French bread was hard as a rock and was way too much bread.  The sun dried tomatoes were huge, but overpowered everything else.  I couldn't taste the brie or the prosciutto.     For what I paid and what I've heard, I had expected much better.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience.

My overall recommendation: just go across the parking lot to Einstein's."
1,"Used to be one of our favorites, though the last two times in have disappointed. Recent outing included drinks downstairs and staff was unfriendly and uninterested in helping guests.  Dinner upstairs was a poor experience. Our entrees for our party came out about 10 minutes apart and to make matters worse two entrees were incorrect. One entree was replaced and the second was replaced using the previous plate with a portion of the meal replaced.  Has Rokerij lost it's touch?"
5,"Los Olivos definitely takes the cake when it comes to car washes for me. Even though I live about 15 minutes away, I always bring my car here at least once a week to be bathed. The wash is cheap, well done and bonus that they are perpetually friendly. If you want a sub par wash that uses brushes and the employees couldn't give a crap about you, please, frequent the other 'cheapy places' closer to you."
5,"I dropped off some shears for my girlfriend and they seemed to be pretty good people despite me having no clue what I was doing. 

Word of warning - they are the door that is ACROSS the way from the warehouse door. Do not go in the warehouse side. Walking from McDowell, take the right side of the drive-through thing."
1,"I'm typically a very patient guy and don't like to bash any business but since I'm still stuck here, I might as well make my time useful. Do NOT, and I mean DO NOT come here for an oil change or any service. As soon as I pulled my truck in, I noticed two gentlemen sitting in their stalls doing paperwork. Both just sort of looked at me like a lost little child or soul, trying to find their parents and without the tendency to come out and just say we will be with you shortly. So I waited 10 minutes and just as soon as I was about to hope back in my truck and drive off, a gentlemen comes out and asks me sorry about the wait but what can I do for you. ? I want an oil change how long please? About 1-1.5 hours. Okay long story short, there were others in the waiting area bitching and nagging about the super long wait and Never again will they come here.  After about a 99.5 minute wait I go outside and ask my advisor, do you know how long until my car is ready. It's been over 1.5 hours? Let me check... Waited another 15 mins till my 100% charged IPhone had about 20% left . Finally went back outside and this time I walked into the auto area and saw my truck just sitting there. I go and let him know what's my truck doing there?  Looking puzzled, he goes to the back yells out a name and said bring the truck up! Then he looks at me and said I guess you don't have time for the free car wash eh? Paid and left.  That's how my experience went.  You've been warned"
1,"I heard good things about this place, and was looking forward to what the ""basement"" atmosphere would feel like, lowbrow, a little seedy, etc. Sadly, too many middle-aged men wearing flip flops out on a Friday night. Flip flops? UGH..in Winter? Also, our waiter SUCKED! He acted like he had a hard night and was unwilling to suggest a beer, so I am sure he spit in my draft...Anyhoo, does not matter as I will not return."
1,"I selected North Mountain Dentisty based on these reviews.  When I called to make an appointment, I was equally impressed.  Today, I arrived at 2:40 for my appointment, with my paperwork completed.  I waited 30 minutes before I was informed that the receptionist was going to call my insurance to verify my copays, etc.  I have a new insurance card and when I called to make my appointment, the same receptionist said everything would be verified in advance. When I kindly inquired why this wasn't done in advance, she rudely said ""I'm only one person and have other patients to serve as well.""   Normally, I would expect a small wait for any medical appointment and admittingly I was  impressed by the letter I received in the mail prior to coming in reinforcing that first impressions mean everything to them.  I was so disappointed and frustrated by the lack of timely customer service, that I chose to leave.  Perhaps it was a busy day there, which I understand as well, but I didn't appreciate the poor customer service or lack of appreciation for my time."
5,"I like that this place has a big selection of craft beers. They have a mix and match section which is $9.99 for a 6 pack. That is pretty standard pricing. The guy was very knowledgeable and gave me recommendations as to what I would like. 

They have a huge cheeses, wine, fudge and specialty food items. You could sample whichever cheese you wanted, many of them unique. We know Wisconsin is full of cheese and boy did this place deliver. At check-out they had fudge pops which were also pretty tempting."
5,"Can't believe I've lived in Phoenix for 15 years and have never been to Herberger!
Intimate, clean, well-maintained--not a bad seat in the house!
Will definitely be back!"
5,"After a night of one too many boots of Optimator at Essen Haus and my companion's inability to hold down his alcohol, our little rental car was in dire need of cleaning. (Take it from me, you don't want to see Swiss Fondue a second time). 

The guys here were amazing. I kept expecting ""that smell"" to lurk in the car afterwards, but nope! It was like a brand new vehicle! 

I recommend this place for all your party foul friends that think your backseat is a trashcan."
5,"One of the better mexican places in central phoenix - and there are no shortage of them.

All the standards are great. The chips are always fresh. The salsa is HOT. Yum. Their guacamole is freshly made. You can't go wrong. So go. 

Some of my favorites
Cheese crisp w green chiles
Albondingas (mexican meatball) soup
Shredded beef taco
Green corn tamales

Some of the items on the grill menu are superb! 
Pork chops (with fries and beans - ask for cheese on beans!)
Short ribs 

You really can't go wrong. It's inexpensive, fresh, home cooked, clean, and delicious. 

Only downside - the margaritas are kind of weak. On the other hand, they are cheap, so you can have 3 and it won't hurt you too much. :)"
5,"I have returned again and again for Monty's eggs mornay. When I first ordered it I thought I was getting a typical eggs benedict for breakfast but then something so much better came out. Eggs mornay is eggs benedict made with a mornay sauce instead of hollondaise sauce. The mornay sauce is creamier and peppery! It is so good. I once met a man who ordered a different breakfast but asked for a side of the mornay sauce to dip his potatoes in...that's my kind of breakfast!

I've had their burgers and meatloaf as well, both are equally good but I keep coming back for the eggs mornay! I've also had their red velvet cupcakes which are pretty great too!"
5,"I returned to Duane and his staff for my tax duties again this year, and couldn't be any happier.  As was the case with last year's filing, this one was effortless - quick, professional, helpful, and pleasing.

I was in-and-out of the office in about an hour, and my tax-prep bill was well under $100 - what a bargain!  Service was stellar, and I was pleasantly surprised by the results of my refund - I had anticipated needing to pay in, but instead received a refund.  WIN!

Stop going to the ""big box"" tax preparers, and don't bother with the headache and risk of preparing taxes on your own.  Go see Duane and his crew - you won't be disappointed!!!  They ARE the epitome of a company that delivers ""complete customer satisfaction."""
1,"Shady pricing!!! I took my 12 year old nephew there and they charged me $17.00 for a fade. The price chart say that children under 13 are $14.00. When I questioned the inaccurate fee I was told that it's an extra $3.00 to get ""lined up"" which wasn't even given to us as an option nor was it on the price chart. We will never go back and we will continue to spread the word about their shady prices and hidden fees."
5,"I had a wonderful experience at Monty's. My server was incredibly kind, attentive, and friendly. He could not have had a more pleasant demeanor. The food was also quite good, and the prices are great. I ordered the breakfast burrito and enjoyed it very much. I would definitely go back to Monty's"
1,"Consigner Beware:  I usually do not like to post negative experiences, but this one I believe I must.  I have been consigning at My Sister's Closet for many years (the past 10) and I have had many disappointments along the way as a consigner.  I have dropped off many high-end designer clothes to both the Scottsdale and Phoenix locations throughout the years.  Something that always bothered me was after consigning really expensive new or never worn pieces, I could not locate them anywhere in the store, yet the sales associate always told me they were still an open item on the floor.  The most recent bad experience I had was when I consigned a YSL 2-pc. jacket and slacks from Neiman Marcus.. 2 weeks after I consigned it at the Camelback location, I would periodically stop by to see if the itmes I consigned sold.  The YSL had not sold and showed still open on the floor, but I never found it anywhere.  I checked with sales associates who looked in lay-a-way, but said it wasn't there.  Before the 60 days for consignment was up, and on day 52, I decided to get my pieces back and pay the fee.  The items were nowhere to be found in the store and this is not the first time this has happened.  I looked at every single piece of clothing along with a sales associate.  When I asked to speak to the store manager or one of the owner's, I suddenly received a call back two days later where I was told my YSL outfit was found.  When I asked where?  I was told right there on the front designer rack.  I think not!  I'm not stupid and after taking my merchandise back, I wrote a letter to one of the owner's to at least give her the opportunity to respond.  It's been over 2 mos. and I have not heard one word.  Not one apology, not one explanation, nothing.  So I have decided to never consign with My Sister's Closet ever again, because they simply don't care, and as far as I'm concerned, they lack good cusomer service skills.  I realized my high-end designer pieces which I purchased through my personal shopper had no business being consigned at a business such as My Sister's Closet!"
1,"I used to love this place. It all went down the past few weeks. The food quality was lacking compared to their norm. Usually I could have shrugged this off but this last time was most disappointing. My wife was just cut from a long double. When we walked in I noticed three very young snickering girls at the bar. The bartender approached us and after ordering our drinks he said he couldn't serve my wife because the manager, who was one of the snickering girls, believed she was intoxicated, which was quite the opposite. The girls sitting around the bar continued to laugh. Obviously we were way more aware than they realized. Normally they have decent bar food and good drink specials but if this how they treat customers they don't deserve business. The biggest complaint is their beer lines taste dirty. The biggest plus used to be fried pickles but now I just enjoy them at The Turf instead. Usually I'm not so easily offended but this was bit ridiculous. I will definitely update my review if this changes."
5,"I was in search of a new refrigerator, I did a lot or searching online. I found that Brothers Main promises low prices.  I went in one evening to look around and was hoping to settle on something that evening.  The gentleman working the floor was extremely nice, wasn't pushy at all. He was very patient with me (I think I looked over some refrigerators like 20 times!). He was very knowledgeable and if he didn't know something, he looked it up or consulted with another colleague. Once I found the refrigerator that I wanted to purchase, he showed me that they were indeed the lowest price (he brought up other competitor's prices via internet), and he even knocked off additional money to be sure. He discussed that within 30 days if the price became lower somewhere else, they would refund me the difference. I had my refrigerator delivered and the two gentleman who installed it were VERY nice and a pleasure to work with.  My whole experience with Brothers Main was a very positive one. It's always a pleasure to support local businesses, and they do show their appreciation for their customers.  Will definitely be getting future appliances through them."
1,Don't walk by.  Run by this place and don't look back.  The worst Mexican food in Phoenix.  Absolutely no flavor. The only thing going for it is the friendly wait staff.
1,"Doesn't matter how good the may be, if you get bad service, the whole evening is ruined. 

This was a return visit, so we knew about the limited seating. The wait was a half an hour, not something I have patience for but since we were with friends, we stuck it out. 

After we were finally seated, it was 45 minutes before we were served our entrees and then we got one by itself and the rest of the table had to wait for theirs. It would be understandable if the whole restaurant was slow, but two other tables who came in after us were served before we were. 

Our server kept saying ""I'm sorry for the wait"" as her mantra.  I'm sorry, too, for a very unpleasant experience."
5,"Just for the two salsas alone I give this place 5 stars:  that wonderful green and also a maroon salsa------both with a good kick!  I've eaten at Rosita's Place a hundred times and I went again last night.  Honestly, sometimes I can tell when a different cook is in the kitchen, but my cheese enchiladas with the GREEN sauce was the old, wonderful recipe----you've got to order to green sauce.  The diner behind me was orgasmic about his dish, so I had to ask what he ordered:  STEAK PICADO; he gave me a sample and it was mighty tasty with intense heat.  As long as they can get that cheese enchilada right with the green sauce i will be forever devoted-------heck, if they served nothing but the unique green salsa and chips I'd dream about this food!

Don't go here for the tacos or the chimis, but stick with the enchiladas, or cheese crisp or steak picado.  To go to some place like Tee Pee or Don Carlos or Milagro is just silly when you can go to Rosita's Place------this is the real deal, folks!"
5,"Marina Ochoa. Amazing. 2 months later and I'm still getting compliments on the cut, and how healthy it looks. I've been going there for about 4-5 years, and will continue to do so!

Marina will LISTEN to you. Tell her what you want, and she will give you ideas and suggestions. She won't push anything, including products. Though the products she recommends are always topnotch. She won't make you feel like you have to purchase anything. 


The staff is always very cheerful and happy to assist you with any questions. 

Tell Marina, Maria sent you :)"
5,"I would have never thought I could find BBQ like this in PHX, AZ. I find myself at this place everytime I'm in the Phoenix area! I love there BBQ sauce and the meat is great! If you see this place stop and try it out!"
1,"My Experiences in this store have not been good for some years now.  GAP, Banana, and Old Navy used to make affordable and quality clothing, but in the past few years, the prices have increased and the quality has gone to shit.  Clothes I have bought have had their hems fall out after one wearing and their buttons fall off quite easily.  Not only is the quality bad, but the service is horrendous.  Last time I was in the store, a worker said hi to me, but after looking around for a while, never checked in with me, and when I needed a fitting room they were locked and I had to wait almost 10 minutes to get the gals attention to let me in.  
The last pair of shoes I bought there were quite comfortable, but within the first 30 minutes of wear, the heel feel off completely.  If you are looking for work attire/dress clothes, I would recommend passing on Banana Republic and trying your luck at Macy's or another retailer."
1,"Unless you get Holly to cut your hair avoid this location at all cost. She seems to be the only person in the entire place that understands she is supposed to listen to what the customer wants. 

I recently got my haircut there from someone other than Holly and was absolutely butchered, easily the worst haircut of my life. Not only did the ""stylist"" not listen to what I wanted but she was borderline argumentative. 

In short, if you walk into this location looking to get a haircut and Holly isn't there, just turn around and walk out."
5,Consistently delicious.
5,"The most family oriented work out place in town.  We love the indoor family and warm water pools. The nursery staff is excellent. I like that when we come in to drop the kids off at the nursery, they greet us by our first names.  I love the infrared sauna they recently put in. 
One advice I would give to people who are considering of joining is that you don't have to get the most exclusive membership like gold cove, if you are only going to work out on the machines. We have gold cove, the most expensive membership which allows you to have exclusive access to outdoor water park during summer and most of the group fitness classes offered in the club but we hardly go to group fitness class and hardly go to outdoor water park. The water temperature is still cold even it is 80 degrees out. This past summer, we went to the outdoor water park maybe two- three times the most and stayed out no more than half hour. So, it really isn't worth to have a gold cove unless you know you are looking for specific classes with GC membership. 
The parking and getting the machine to work out can be a problematic during winter months between 4:30-7:00PM. Sometime, you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for the machine to free. If that's the case, you can go sit in the sauna until some people leave. So, I would suggest go there early in the morning or late in the evening but then if you are bringing along your little ones you run into problems with daycare after nursery is closed. They have a restaurant that offers supposedly healthier food but we never had any luck with the food there. The taste is okay and price is a little bit on the high end for the amount you get."
5,"Main Moon has the best lunch in McFarland, buffet style. Friendly service, gloriously large takeout menus, and sauces like no one else. Try their fried pork dumplings, crab Rangoon, or General Tso's. Their fried rice is legit. All portions are generous. Until secondary Moons are established, make your lunar landing as soon as you can. Delicious."
5,"My fathers van broke down,so I called AAA and they sent Les from Prairie Land Towing to tow it home for us. He never hesitated to put it the driveway even though it was icy and kind of narrow...He even helped push the van further up into the driveway and put bricks under it so it wouldn't roll. I told him if we ever need roadside or towing assistance again I would be calling Prairie Land Towing and requesting him to assist us.Thank you again for your excellent service!"
5,"Extremely competent staff. Got me into the right contact lenses on the first appt. Everyone was friendly and I interacted with every employee on my first visit. They have a Middleton clinic as well, and a good website with lots of information about the doctors. I researched a lot before I found them and I'm glad I made the right choice. Have already had friends go to see them."
5,Best Chinese food in the area. Great service and calming atmosphere.
1,"Awful.

The selection still consists mostly of t-shirts from the 90s and out of style clothing. Yet, when I bring in my VERY RECENTLY purchased designer clothes to sell to them--- they take nothing. Hmmm... someone needs to take a second look at how they manage their inventory.

Today I went there for the last time. I brought a never-worn Banana Republic cashmere sweater, T-bags dress, JCrew dress, and new CHLOE dress (among other very good, wintery items) that the girl at the counter didn't take. She was about 18 and obviously wasn't trained to recognize good merchandise!! That's just lost money for them... considering they mark up what they buy from you by about FOUR TIMES as much as what they gave you for it.

I suggest My Sister's Closet."
1,"This review is for the service (or complete lack of, I should say), not the food because we never got that far. We are visiting for Spring Training and thought this would be a fun place to take the kids. What a joke. The place was not busy at all. Empty tables everywhere. Still we are told it is going to be a 20 min wait. When I question the hostess about this, she tells me it might not be that long but they need to get some tables cleared off. There were other people around looking equally as irritated as we were. We enjoyed checking out the field, took some cool pictures and finally asked the manager 25 min later when we might be seated. His response was that he would seat us as soon as he could, but he didn't want to seat us and not have us get served. We experienced the only positive thing this place has going for it (location, picture opportunities) and got the hell out of there. Completely lame."
5,"First off I have to say thanks to the fellow yelpers!!! 

I have worked downtown for over 5 years and drove by this place every day twice a day.... and had no idea it was even open for business. The place looks abandoned and quite scary.  I have seen some interesting people next door and I would have never given the place a shot if it wasn't for you all!    On to the food :) 

Since this was my first time I thought I would try the basic Mexican food combo to judge the place.  I had the #17 Taco and Enchilada rice and beans I added beef to the enchilada. (comes shredded unless you specify ground) I can't say one bad thing about the dish. It was amazing. The rice was perfect for my taste and even the beans were good.  I really enjoyed the salsa. Some may not since it is not a fresh tomato and onion type of salsa. It is more like a hot sauce. The service was good. The atmosphere was good.  Prices are good. 

This will absolutely be added to the Mexican Food Lunch rotation!!"
5,"I moved to Madison a year ago, and what's the first thing I did? 
I attended a Madison Mallards game with Gwen and Dan.
(I think I still owe you guys money.) 
Let me tell ya, it's all it's quacked up to be. Ohhhhhh! 
Seriously though, I can't remember the last time I had so much fun at a ballpark. Sure the space itself leaves little to be desired. It's small. Seating is uncomfortable, and depending on where you're at the sun can be beating down on you for quite a while. BUT, what the place lacks in ambiance and comfort, it MORE THAN makes up for in pure good ole American fun. There's something happening between every inning. Look here! Now here! No over there! Hey look at that! It's like an ADD wet dream. You're never bored. You can't be! The activities and inning breaks definitely cater towards kids, but I found myself laughing, cheering, screaming wiener at the top of my lungs. Food in my opinion is only so, so. I like that there are local options but they're not great. They can't be... it's a ballpark and they're using prep kitchens. I will say the beer options are nothing short of amazing. I also dig that players typically stick around after the game and sign stuff for the little ones. It doesn't get more local than a Mallards game, except on July 4th of this year at the Hometown Classic. What's a Hometown Classic you ask? Oh, just a head to head of central Wisconsin's minor, minor, like ""is he able to drive"" minor team players. 
Such. A. Hoot."
5,"FISH FRY was OUT OF THIS WORLD! I read an article in Madison magazine about how this place had one of the best fish fry's in town and decided to try it out! What a gem! First, The fish fry comes with salad and a side. Super Nice.  Secondly, they must have the world's best tartar sauce! I could literally drink the stuff. Third, I took five people here who all had the fish fry and drinks and it only set me back 60 Bucks! WOW! I will be back!"
1,"Waited at our table for 25 minutes before we were helped, we were served cold food, and the waitress told us we couldn't split our checks between 2 people... Hmmm id say it was definitely not a good experience."
5,"We ate there only because it's Alice Cooper's.  I thought it would be overpriced with lousy food.
Since we were just traveling through on vacation, we didn't know there would be a game at the stadium across the street starting an hour after we drove by, fighting game traffic.  Crap, should we just go somewhere else? We really wanted to go there, so we did.  There were even a few people lingering out front, so...
The place wasn't overly crowded, we got right in.  The service was FAR above expectations, as was the food.  Good menu and beverage selections.
I'd go back in a heartbeat when I'm in Phoenix!  Hats off to Alice (who apparently only shows up every few months, so don't expect to see him serving you your Big Unit :)"
1,"Don't waste your time: Try Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, Hannys, Z Pizza or even Oreganos. All gourmet pizza with local fare and local products and I've never had an experience like:

I had lunch CPK this afternoon and had a less than desirable experience and I wanted to share it with you. Long-story-short, we ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza without cilantro. The pizza arrived with cilantro. I had one bite after my partner had one piece. After the bite, I notified the server that there was cilantro. He was very accommodating, said that he requested it without cilantro and then hastily rectified the situation by ordering a different pizza. 

While we were awaiting the second pizza, the manager arrived at our table to address the situation. He did not offer his name, but immediately apologized for the inconvenience which we appreciated. He, however, continued with informing us that there was no cilantro on the pizza. Then asked us, ""Did you not want scallions on there, because it was scallions on the pizza, not cilantro."" I informed him that I tasted and saw cilantro, which I had pointed out to the server. He replied with, ""No, they did not put any cilantro on the pizza!"" To which I replied, ""Well I don't know...I didn't put cilantro on the pizza."" To which he replied, ""Well, the new pizza will be here shortly,"" as he walked away.

I have a few serious issues with this managerial approach. First, it is unprofessional to insinuate that any guest is lying. Second, I find it insulting that he would go on to insinuate that we don't know the difference between scallions and an herb we specifically requested be omitted. Finally, I believe arguing with the guest should be strictly avoided. 

Man, what a twat!"
1,"The workers aren't knowledgeable of the store layout, which is a mess by the way. (I asked a woman where the letter stickers are for things like mailboxes and she pointed me on the opposite side of the store when I thought they'd be...right where they ended up being. She also lacked any confidence in her sentence when she said, ""Yeah, I think so,"" in reference to where they weren't.)

The most helpful woman there let us know that they didn't carry the fabric paint we needed, which wad disappointing but at least honest.

They in general don't seem to care about customer service in the front since there were 6 people talking and two of those people were cashiering. The other four were ignoring the line of waiting customers while chatting with each other, and the chatter was not work related either. Then, after ten minutes of waiting in line as the next customers, one cashier took people behind us while the other took someone not even waiting in line! Ridiculous!

To say the least, the crafts have to sell themselves and thank goodness for the employees here that artists and people that do crafts on a regular basis find the need to buy supplies here or this place would be out of business quickly if based only on the customer service."
5,"My friend and I are super cool. And by super cool, I mean we went while it was raining, and did not realize that indoor seating was an option. 

We eventually were pulled in by the friendly staff, and they helped us bring our food in. Kudos to you guys. I had the peanut butter and bacon burger. What's not to like? Peanut butter? Good. Meat? Good. Bacon? Gooooooooood!

We also ordered the poutine fries. Not your traditional poutine fries at all, but still delicious nonetheless. 

Love the decor and the brunch menu looks amazing. The area is great to explore, so me and my friend will definitely be back!"
5,"If you are at all bashful or have issues around nudity, you might want to stop reading now.  This place will not be for you.... but for the free spirited, the Alwun House is the place to be this month for their Erotic Art Festival.

The exhibit kicks off with their outrageous sneak preview party tonight, (Feb. 8th) at 7pm.  Don't expect to see stuffy art aficionados milling about with glasses of champagne. Do expect to see transvestites on 8 inch platform shoes dancing and laughing with the  glitter dusted, the body painted, the latex clad, and the goths. They create a club atmosphere in their back yard with a floor show of comics, cross dressers, dancers, acrobats and contortionists.  You can't immerse yourself in the circus atmosphere and not walk away smiling."
1,"First of all, they charged us to split an entree.  In fact, we had to do the splitting - I guess they charge to have access to an extra plate.  The mushrooms in our enchilada were canned, and then burned.  The ranchero sauce tasted like the red sauce that comes with Spaghetti-O's.   The chips and salsa was less spectacular than the stuff I buy on sale at the grocery store.  The part I depend on most to get me through crappy Mexican food - margaritas - also disappointed.  They tasted like Kool-Aid (but without adequate water) and lacked tequila.  This was all at the west side location, and I hear the east side is even worse.  No vuelvo."
5,"Oh my gosh this place is great. The bartender is so sweet and remembered my friends' names when they walked in. The pbr was cheap, delicious, and cold. Exactly the type of bar I want to sit and have a beer and make friends with at."
5,"Have been going to this restaurant since I was in a high chair, seriously! We don't go back because it's where we've always gone, but because of the good food and great service. Their chorizo with beans and rice is very good, and so is their horchata. My dad gets the shrimp tostadas and menudo and enjoys is every time. Price for all the food you get is not bad at all. If you're in the downtown area and really want some good Mexican food, this is the place to go."
1,"Paisley moved locations (by about 100 yards), and on the new location was a mural beloved by the neighborhood and painted by an internationally-renowned Phoenician artist called El Mac who creates amazing and sometimes massive murals all over the world.

They painted over it."
5,"I'm a big fan of eating Midwest brunches and I can tell quality vs. quantity.

My boyfriend took me here on a surprise date because he is a big fan of watching planes take off, so I thought it was novel to have brunch there.

The quality of the food blew me away as well as the friendly service. 

We ordered crab cakes benedict with hollandaise sauce and the 2x2x2 (pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon, and fruit cup OR hashbrowns).  The other reviewers down below are correct that their pancakes are TDF light airy and buttery delicious. 

The crab cakes benedicts were perfect - not too rich, and not too heavy and very nicely presented.  The waitress was a middle aged woman who was very attentive to us.

The price is also very reasonable for brunches in Madison. I would highly recommend this place, and I believe it is one of Madison's best kept secret diners.  It wasn't as cheap as the Come Back Inn located near the Essen Haus nor Plaka's Mediterranean meat intensive style brunches, however, the quality was far superior (and don't get me wrong, I adore the Come Back Inn!)

You'll also be interested in the proudly presented amateur photos of Air Force One from when President Obama visited Madison in Nov 2009, the staff were happy to give the run down of his landing at the private airstrip."
5,"This place is amazing big.. I had no idea that it was this massive, 4 levels of pure exhibits and shows.

We circled the museum until we saw Heritage Parking (park there for the most convenience and price). Bring your ticket to the check-in counters inside the museum and they will validate your parking. Unfortunately, they will not cover 100% of the fee, but they will discount it. I believe we parked for 4 hours and I ended up paying $5. Heritage Parking also takes credit cards, so that really saved me a big headache.

We went on a day where there were huge crowds from school field trips, so it was hard to maneuver around, and super busy, but after the afternoon was over, much of it cleared out and we didn't have to wait in line to try out different exhibits. There were tons of interesting things to see and try out, Iuckily my 3 year old was interested, but I would not bring anyone younger than that, or else they will become bored.

It's unfortunate that the shows are to be paid individually and not included in admission, but I can understand. There was so much to see and do I was getting dizzy. I'm glad that they covered everything from physics, physiology, chemistry, geography, meteorology, technology, and much, much more.. it looks like they have a good range of subjects and it didn't look cheap.

I was able to get a membership (with my today admission counted in), for the 3 of us for $85, but it sucks that you have to pay for parking every. single. time.. too bad they don't just add full parking fees into the admission. I guess if you go to the Children's Museum of Phoenix about a block away from here, you can park there and walk here, and then walk back when the day is done, but it's just a lot of work. Overall, we were highly satisfied!"
1,"Noon and I'm starving! 

hadn't eaten since the night before... i could feel my stomach slowly eating itself! after picking up some stuff on my way back to work i saw Blimpies... as usual... seen it a million times but never stopped in. 

there were a few folks inside... looked cozy enough.. 

the lady behind the counter wasn't very social... just what do you want.. and that was it... :( 

i had a toasted 6in with roast beef/ turkey/ cheddar... 
They didn't have very many veggies to choose from..... not even pickles... 

for some reason the sandwich was really small and was not filling at all... i was still hungry... 

It left me wishing i had chosen subway instead... 

and just for that dinky sub i spent $4.75... 

Not worth it in my book..."
1,"This place is way overrated!!! They let ur car sit for 5-10 minutes before they even start to dry it.  By this time the water spots are already dry and they miss spots in the front or sides all the time.  Their armor all has gone down as well.  They used to have the best tire gloss that would last for 10 days, now they use a cheaper brand that's dull.  This place has really gone down over the years.  Again, way overrated.  30 second vacuum pfffff"
1,"I don't understand the regular bustle and patio crowd here, except for maybe the wine.  I thought the sandwiches were just so so, unmemorable.
the tea as well."
5,"While in Madison for a ski trip, I tapped into the almighty resource that is Yelp to find some unique eats. I didn't want to eat any of the other chain garbage that all the other tourists were eating near the hotel. Enter NOTO. What an awesome little find!

After reading some of the reviews, I wanted to try a little bit of everything. The woman at the counter suggested we try the Mardi Gras Combo and the popular Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich. I wanted to try the dirty rice and was told that I could substitute the regular rice in the Combo for dirty rice. Yes, please!

First, I'd like to clarify that the sandwich is NOT as big as other reviews may make it out to be. It's a standard French roll with a standard amount of fillings BUT the flavors are admittedly some of the best I've ever had. The juxtaposition of creamy, tangy sauce with the crunchy, juicy shrimp combined with the fresh lettuce will have you swooning for more.

On to the combo... What a cornucopia (nods to Candice G.) of beautifully tasty french creole goodness all nestled magically in compartmentalized order without any compartments in the take-out box. It traveled several miles successfully in the manner as well. The warnings of the menu and lady at the counter on the spiciness of the dirty rice and shrimp creole were accurate. It was a flavorful, creeping sort of spice that increased with each bite. Absolutely fantastic.

The name ""take-out"" is rather misleading because there is ample seating inside the place and many interesting jazz memorabilia to peruse over while eating so eat-in instead of taking-out as the name suggests.

I'll definitely be making a stop here again whenever I'm in the Madison area for some good ol' N'Orleans style cookin'."
5,"I have to give this place 5-stars. The cheese plates are small and everything is a bit pricey, but I feel it's well worth it. Windows surround the building to the east and north. You can gaze out on Central Avenue and watch passers-by, cars and the light rail. The area suggests Phoenix is coming of age into a more distinctive urban area, rather than its notorious sprawling suburban-esque cityscape. It's in a gentrifying neighborhood that's quickly becoming a more artistic, upscale part of town. They have a lengthy wine and cheese list, the latter offering suggested wine pairings (if you're embarrassed to ask the server.) However, some pairings not suggested may surprise you. The last time I went I was a bit disappointed that my favorite wine they sell (Duck Pond) is only available by the bottle. The cheeses are good, though I've learned from experience to try a small taste of some before taking a larger bite, and I haven't heard of most of them before going here. I enjoy the Nearly Naked Theatre company, which performs at the neighboring Phoenix Art Museum, and always stop in here for a bit of wine and cheese prior to showtime."
1,"I am 95% sure I acquired a nasty food based illness here. I ate some of the chicken nuggets, and within 2 hours I was terribly ill, vomiting the entire contents of my stomach into my kitchen sink because I was not able to get to the bathroom. 

It was that bad. 

As for the service, the 'help' if you can call it that clearly did not want to be working at the place, and I observed several questionable hygiene related issues in regards to how the staff handled themselves - and the food. 

How was I able to do this, you ask? Well good reader, the reason is that I was standing for 10 minutes at the counter waiting for my order, a Hamburger, a single order of chicken nuggets, a baked potato, and a large soft drink. I had ample time to observe these things. 

I know only the most 'interesting' person would actually enjoy working at a fast food place, but the help here set a new bar of horribleness - if the bar was buried 3 feet into the ground that is. 

Add in the for lack of a better term - 'wiped out' dining room which was filthy, and you get fast food hell. Avoid at all costs - go to another Wendy's - any other Wendy's."
5,"Yum yum yum. Husband and I first went there early on a First Friday night and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. We didn't want anything too heavy since we were planning on doing some walking so we split the Spanish cheese plate which was delightful. The fig cake is delicious!! Splitting the plate made the bill pretty affordable and it was just enough to fill us up without overdoing it.

The server was very helpful in suggesting a champagne for me and red wine for husband. Don't remember what we had but my champagne had a strawberry in it and was perfectly bubbly. 

Ambiance and decor is nice and mellow. We've since been back with friends and it has been enjoyable for both a date night and chatting it up with people. Enjoy!"
1,I've been mis-diagnosed many times by Dr. Austin. The wait is ALWAYS an hour or two and you have to keep calling the office to get results.
5,Red Rocks :)
5,"This is the greatest restaurant I've ever been to.  But I love rock music.  If you hate rock music and baseball and you have no sense of humor, you probably won't get as much of a kick out of this place as we always do.  We ALWAYS go here when we're in Phoenix.  Good food, awesome decor and quirky menu choices like ""Wings of Mass Destruction"" and ""Megadeth Meatloaf."""
5,"As the previous reviewer mentioned, this is a newly remodeled facility which has turned out wonderfully. All new equipment and works great. 

I have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. 

I have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. 

I have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!

I have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.

The only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot. Its about as narrow as one lane, and people come in and out of same drag."
5,"I'm so happy to have found this place. And it's in my neighborhood! Everything is very reasonably priced and the staff was very helpful. My little maltese mix is quite a chewer which means I'm always having to buy new toys. I've saved a bundle here! I've even purchased a toy for $3 that I've seen for $15 - $20 at the pet store. They have a huge assortment of toys, grooming products and treats so you'll have no problem spending the required $25."
5,"Finally go to the Tip Top last night for dinner and had a great experience.  Great job with the remodel, and the outdoor patio is very nice as they put up a high enough fence to block the street and make it private, but it is lareg enough to be fun.
  Excellent liquor and beer selections at reasonable prices.  Food was way better than expected - huge portions, excellent quality, and nicely different than the usual Madtown fare.  

We had fried pickles which were done with tempura batter so they were not heavy and the slight sweetness of the batter nicely offset the brininess of the pickles.  Huge basket with a great home made dipping sauce ( a remoulade) as well.   Then, thank God cause it is also big, we split a plate of two pepper mac 'n cheese, which was cooked perfectly and the jalapenos were offset perfectly by the poblanos for a flavorful balance.  

Twelve taps, good cocktails, great service and a friendly atmosphere.  Hope you do well Tip Top!"
5,Food is good. Place is nice. And girls are hot like a chile lol 5 stars yay!
5,This place has the best Mexican food ever! Authentic is an understatement. The alphabet soup they give you at the beginning is delicious. Prices are very reasonable so you won't be disappointed
5,good diner food with lot's of tasty vegetarian options and with pie or cheesecake for dessert...
5,I trust Yelp reviews with my life and Yelp did not fail me. I took my watch here for repair after I busted it over Christmas. (I have a procrastination issue.) I left my watch for a quote on Friday and got it back on Monday. Fortunately it was an easy repair so no parts had to be ordered. Only $10! (Your results may vary.) I'm so happy and wish I hadn't waited so long to take my watch in.
1,"After a meal at Moira Sushi, we decided on a whim to stop in at Jordon's for a fried ice cream dessert.  We walked in the door and the place smelled of old carpet and b.o.  Not very appetizing, but I'm willing to give any place a chance.

We ordered the dessert, it arrived promptly...and was clearly not freshly made.  A very icky mushy crust with some cinammon and a dab of whipped cream, after a few bites we both looked at each other and said ""yuck!"".  Worst fried ice cream we've ever had!

After seeing some of the food passing by, it's probably on par with any other chain mexican, similar to a macayos or carlos o'briens.  Crispy tacos, flaccid yellow cheese, tomato and lettuce on everything.  Surely a step up from Taco Bell, but what's the point of that?  

WIth so many authentic cheap (and good) Mexican food places nearby with great corn tortillas and cotija cheese, I'll call this one a total pass....and I understand why I've never stepped foot in the door in 10 years that I've lived within 3 miles of the place."
1,"Grade: F

Even the fantastic Crunch Coat Blizzard can't make up for the deep fried tumor passed off as a chicken breast."
5,"I've only been going here for just under a year. I'm expecting my first child and had a lot of questions, and everyone from the front desk all the way to the doctor answered every single one of them.. No problem. Dr. Gibson is my doctor, she is very helpful, and she has answered every question for me, she is kind and asks questions about my family just to get to know me. I feel very comfortable going here and I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Very unhelpful. The staff did not even attempt to address my needs.
1,"I went in to Paper Joy this past week and I have to say  it was the worst experience in my life.  I'm not sure if the owner saw us pull up in a beat up truck and me walk in with my mom and neice and nephew, and assumed we were poor and I was un-wed with two kids!!  Or if she is just this rude to everyone.  I walked into the small cramped space and was ignored, so I started looking around.  She has a few examples of invitations on her back wall, so I started to look at those, I was not impressed.  I finally went over to her desk and she finanlly asked if we needed help.  I told her I just got engaged and wanted to see some examples of invitations and save the dates, and she told me I had to make an appointment.  There wasn't anyone in the store, she was very rude, and I could tell she was passing judgment on us.  She must not have seen the rock on my finger! Sure my parent's don't have a lot of money, hence the beat up truck we pulled into the parking lot in.  But my paren't aren't paying for my wedding.  My fiance and myself are, we are getting married at the Waldorf Astoria in Chicago (I was visiting family in AZ and wanted to involve my Mom in some of the planning).  If she wasn't so judgemental and allowed us to look through some examples we may have used her, all though I wasn't impressed with the few examples she did have on her wall!  She has no idea what my budget was and if she did know I'm sure she would have treated us better, but to be honest I wouldn't want to give someone like that my buisness.  Make sure you make an appointment before stopping in this place, and make sure you are dressed to the nines so she doesn't think your money is worthless in her store.  BTW - her webiste says appointments are preferred, not necessary!  No thanks!"
5,"Cheese, cheese and more cheese! Oh and wine, fudge and kitschy souvenirs, too. The anticipation of stopping here on the way back to Chicago from Hanock, WI made the three hour ride home more bearable. 

The staff was super friendly and willing to let you sample almost anything. I tried some cheese spreads, fudge and fancy cheeses such as Mango Habanero. I regret not picking up more cheese!"
1,If the fact that they closed at Biltmore doesn't say something.....I'd rather stab myself in the hand w/ a fork than eat there! Ugh!!
5,"Ok, I hesitated writing a review of this place because I like that it's not busy, but I want the place to survive because I enjoy it so much. 

I hate gyms...I mean LOATHE them. From rude staff to unpleasant odors or creepy guys giving you longing looks while you're just trying to figure out which one of your friends with an advanced degree in engineering you can text to help you figure out how to get on a machine without having it rip your arm out of its socket because the staff is not going help you without paying for a personal trainer or because you don't look like you were already born on a nautilus machine. 

This gym is everything but. I went in because of the great introductory special and a recommendation of a friend. We're both training to swim the SF Bay for the 2011 Sharkfest Alcatraz Swim, so we needed a pool. 

As soon you walk in, the guy at the front desk treats you like you're an old buddy and cracks jokes like he is your best bar buddy. Awesome attitude. The place has never been overly crowded (even at peak hours right after work. I've never gone during the early morning or lunch hours).

No waits on the machines and they have plenty of them. No waiting in the pool and even when there is a water aerobics class, one lane is left open to due laps. Hot tub, sauna, and some inexplicable walk in dunking tub (see, I'm not a gym aficionado or else I would know what that thing is for).

Towel service, locks, and even gym shorts available. (no more using that excuse that you can't work out today because you left your work out clothes at home...they have some to check out there.)

Even the seemingly cranky old lady doing her water workout was nice and called me sweetie and asked if I was ok when I inadvertently let out a puppy like whimper as my shoulder blades decided they wanted to cede from the union of my body. Note to self....don't do a month of the P90X with a friend, think you're hot stuff and on your way to a gym bod and then jump in a pool to do a mile swim without stretching because you think you're all that now. Had it not been for Grandma Water Aerobics, I might still be at the far end of the pool trying to inch my way back to the stairs hoping that the water on my face hid the tears that were going start gushing any minute if I couldn't make it to the hot tub to get my back to stop seizing up.  (Thank you, unknown Water Aerobics lady. You turned a moment of shame into motivation. Oh yeah, I will out swim grandma next time!)

The place is in the basement of an office building next to the seemingly abandoned Chateaux on Central development. Central and....Encanto (?) 
You can park on the street (careful of the meters) or use the garage. The gym validates. 

There is a downstairs weight room (I haven't check it out yet as I because there is a free gym at my job.) Yes, I like this place so much, I am paying for a gym membership even though I have access to work out facilities for free in my own building....including free personal trainer....but instead I get in my car come 5pm and drive to a gym I pay for because this athletic club is worth it. 

I saw no young kids running around. The clientele seems to be early  30s and up, young urban professionals and some retirees who are just trying to stay healthy. No creepy people ogling you (which you may be looking for) and no rude gym bunnies laughing at you in your leotard on the treadmill....but really....you shouldn't have the leotard and hot pink leg warmers on anyway...it is 2010.  But hey, to each his own."
5,"Having just moved to the Phoenix area, and after being burnt previously buy a dealership in Portland, Or. I decided that relying on the professionalism of a BMW Dealership Service Department was not going to get me anywhere but broke and frustrated. I found Bavarian Motors here on YELP and I was not at all disappointed. Ray got me in quick and had the car ready the next day. No up sells, no hassles, a truly pleasant experience, to include the final bill. Even the folks from Enterprise Car Rental, who he set me up with, had nothing but good to say about this shop and their reputation.  As long as I am in the Valley here, Ray and his team will be the ones taking care of my 2 BEEMERS.

BTW - Ray do you do Harley Davidson's too by chance?

Keep up the good, honest, and friendly work !"
5,"I stopped at the mousehouse on my drive home from Wisconsin Dells soley because i thought the name of it was adorable. Inside its very warm & welcoming. We were the only people in there and were asked by 4 different people if we wanted any samples or had any questions. The staff is amazing and excited to help you, which makes me excited to be there! They were all very pleasant to us. 

They have delicious deli sandwiches that are made to order. I walked out with some fresh string cheese, cheese whips, a snack pack of beef and cheese, and two blocks of cheese. It was very reasonably priced in there. And of course you can try any of them before buying them! 

I highly reccommend the Mousehouse Jack (their house blend cheese) & the Habanero cheese. It's got kick to it, but it's delicious! I will definately be stopping again on my next trip past there.The horseradish & the asiago cheese spreads are AMAZINGLY delicious. as well. be sure to pick up a cheese spread knife for $.99 & a box of crackers on your way out because you'll want to snack on your way home."
1,"After reading all the other reviews of this place I have determined one thing. You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.

Went at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.

They started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?

We decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.

I thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. 

Overall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table."
1,"Wow. What a disappointment. Dirty plates, coffee was horrible and the water tasted like linen. Never come here."
1,"Horrible apartments...
Don't let the outside appearance fool you! I originally started renting here when it was the peaks at papago park and everything was great, when they switched management to red mountain villas things went downhill. Take a good look around the complex and you will notice several empty apartments for good reasons. In the two years I lived there 4 different families moved in and out next door because of decline in management. The new management kept charging and reversing late fees, weren't responsive to calls, and entered our apartment without notice or consent...yes that really happened.

After move out they are trying to charge for carpet replacement when we didn't have any damage...we even had a walk through and the person said we didn't need to fix anything...now we have a 600 dollar bill!

Needless to say...don't rent here."
5,"This place is awesome! I went on a weekday, it was quite crowded but Pat O'Malley was hard at work accommodating us as best he could. We sat at the bar and had a fantastic breakfast. Pat took the time to ask our names and he was always looking out for everyone on his staff. You should definitely place this restaurant on your list as a must do! Not to mention the ambiance/view is fabulous."
5,"If Ranch Market is not your thing-- then you are missing out on some really great things.  

1.  Chips  (as in chips and salsa)-- they make their own tortilla chips that are only 99cents for a bag.  I brought them to a work party and everyone liked me more than the day before.

2. Birthday cakes for kiddies--- wow- talk about a frickin' cool Dora the Explorer cake, or a Spongebob cake-- it put Costco and Aunt Cindy to shame.

3.  Meat-- this meat case is LOADED, even if you don't want to buy fresh meat, just go there to look at it. 

4.  The affordabiltiy-- C&H Sugar was $1.19 at Ranch Market and $2.99 at any other grocery (non sale priced).  

It's like a party in this place, the last time I was there was right before the holidays and I found myself just having a good ol' time grabbing the chips for a work party.  I even stopped by the jewelry counter and contemplated purchasing a 3 inch gold cross, but decided against it.  :o)"
1,"My friend and I decided to try out TGI Fridays for a beer during the baseball game to get a bigger bang for our buck. For what we would pay for a small hot dog and 20 oz beer, we could get a great meal, larger beers, and great service, right?! Wrong. 

The restaurant was not very crowded for a game night, yet we were denied a table overlooking the stadium. Twice. The manager asked us to visit the hostess stand to get a table, but they informed us there was a wait. NO ONE WAS IN LINE FOR THE RESTAURANT! 

I had to get our own menus from the bar, after playing ""let's avoid making eye contact, and maybe she will go away."" After we ordered, three sets of people were sat in the tables we were waiting for, and their meals came out before our order! 

Our waiter ended up offering us a free beer for the late arrival of our food, and ended up comping our entire check, but that will be my last visit ""Front Row."" 

I'd rather pay $10 for a beer and $8 for a processed hot dog than to get snobbed by anyone in the service industry. All I wanted was a good time after a work day from hell, and to enjoy a Diamondbacks game ..."
5,"This place rocks! I got the Gyoza and Oyako bowl for lunch  on Tuesday and I was immediately a fan. 

The gyoza is deep fried deliciousness and comes in pork or shrimp (I think? I opted for pork) and it is BOMB! 

And the Oyako was amazing, grilled chicken cooked perfectly, and blended with light eggs, veggies and rice that added a sweetness to the chicken and eggs. Amazing balance in this dish. Whole meal was like $10 too, and that includes a ""medium"" lemonade which is actually HUGE!! Seriously, get a small lol

All in all I greatly enjoyed myseld, and the service is off the charts. They do everything they possibly can to make sure you're enjoying your meal, and all with huge smiles on their face, like they enjoy their job or something. Weird lol

GO HERE!"
5,"Willy Bike Works has bailed me out with an urgent bike repair on more than one occasion, and I've never had a bad experience with their staff. In fact, they've not charged me for labor on some minor repairs on several occasions. Conveniently located right next to the Southwest Bike Trail on East Wash. For minor fixes, they'll usually do the work right away while you're waiting. Frequently have good sales on merchandise, and a great selection of mountain and road bikes for sale."
1,"This place was a huge disappointment. After hearing how it had been recognized on the Food Network, I went there with a friend on a Sunday evening and found the food to be mediocre and overpriced. The waiter also tried desperately to get us to purchase wine and sides. I finally relented to an order of garlic bread, and was served plain, stale bread. For this stale bread, we got charged $3. I will not be going back. If you want Italian, Red Devil is a better deal with a nicer atmosphere and better wait staff.. Oh yeah, the bread is good and complimentary."
1,"The last time I was in Phoenix I had a business dinner here and ordered their wings and then some special meal (included salad, chicken and something else).  The place was empty and the waitress was actually bothered we had chosen to eat dinner in her section.  To make a long story short - I got sick that night with some type of food poisoning and spent the next 12 hours trying to sleep between throwing up and running a fever.  Will definitely never go back."
1,Pricey and bad quality service.  I immediately had to re-do my hair upon leaving and did a much better job myself with products from Sallys.  (and for less than half of what I was charged..)  Bottom line:  Dont waste your money or time at this salon.
5,"We were in Madison for a wedding and chose Pat O'Learys based off proximity and Yelp reviews. We were so glad we did! We liked it so much we came back the next morning. A unique dining experience being able to see all the small planes and hear the pilot talk among the patrons. And the first day we met both Pat and Pam as we were checking out, they were both so nice and shared stories with us about the small airport. The food is classic diner fare, and doesn't disappoint. Definitively recommend this place for both the food and the experience."
1,"There is nothing here, not the food, not the service, not the ""ambiance"", that's worth the inexplicable and inexcusable wait for food to be delivered when the place is half empty to begin with.  I'm done."
5,great people run this place. it is clean and the food is always great.
1,"Please Please Please Be More Customer Friendly.

Unfortunately, this store cannot compare with those in nearby Las Vegas in service or variety. The sale associates (except for a nice, pretty brunette female) do not acknowledge you and they give off a vibe that you are bothering them. Rarely do they have my size shoe (Gucci men's 9) and they have about 1/3 of the typical Gucci inventory. If you ask about something they don't have, the associate doesn't offer alternatives or offers to have it shipped in for inspection. (LV does that without batting an eye). Security guards are stoic. They stare at you (I get it, it's their job) and if you say hello, they ignore you...they just stare. Makes me feel uncomfortable because I really want to be able to shop there. It is a shame because I would rather shop there vs lugging packages back from California or Vegas."
5,"My BMW was making a strange noise a few months ago.  Took to Chapman BMW on Camelback and was told my car needed a new radiator, mechatronics sealing sleve, upper strout mounts, etc.  Total quoted was $3200 in ""required repairs.""  Same day I took my car to Bavarian Motors - told radiator was fine, just leak in hose. Same with sealing sleeve -- no leaking transmission fluid.  Replaced strut mounts and hoses and price was $470 -- a lot better than my $3200 price given to me at Chapman.  This has happened several other times too with Chapman where I was given very high costs for repairs only later to learn items weren't broken or needing service."
5,"Being from the Chicago area, I am a member of the of the Chicago Botanic Garden [third year] and very much enjoy gardens and plant life ESPECIALLY when I don't have to do any maintenance myself. 
That said, when I saw my opportunity to visit the Olbrich Botanical Garden when passing through the Madison area, I needed to make a stop and take full advantage of the adventure. I've really only been to two official botanic gardens (mostly CBG) however I'm glad Olbrich was another to add to my list. 

It was absolutely pouring down rain when we arrived, which was actually ok because the doors hadn't opened yet, and it also gave us an opportunity to have the gardens to ourselves once we were let in. We checked in with the ladies at the front desk and they happily pointed us to the garden areas and told us about the park; they also lent us an umbrella which was nice customer service. 
We had a plan to do a loop and visit the famous Thai garden (awesome) and our idea paid off greatly. With the rain ever-present we had our own rainforest jungle to enjoy to ourselves, which made for a very peaceful experience. We passed back around to the rose garden and detoured around the flooded pathways, so I'm not entirely sure which gardens we passed through.

After getting soaked (I'm glad I had my waterproof kayaking shoes in the car) we walked through the indoor garden, which was free because I had my membership card for the CBG, otherwise it would have been $2. Even if I had to pay I would have been satisfied, it was pretty cool. They had a variety of trees, fish, painted pheasants, a waterfall, and other hidden gems I wont spoil. 

Although we didn't make a purchase, their gift shop area was pretty nice for its size. If we had more time and nicer weather, I wouldn't hesitate to make this garden a destination for a bit. It's so close to Chicago so I can't see why that would be a difficult task to accomplish. 
I'll be back for sure; but next time I'll bring the sunshine."
5,"So happy with Sarah here. She is nice, quick, and, most importantly, does a great job!  For not much more than Turbo Tax, they get me a big-refund. To me, it is so worth it.  It sounds like there are going to be some changes and a move, but I'll follow Sarah wherever she goes."
5,Keep up all the good work at the Humane Society.
1,"Two words: Overpriced and understaffed.

I'm not sure if Palazzo is always open ""sometimes"" or just recently reopened, but they've brought back the goth night one Friday a month. Just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night, just the establishment itself. 

Every time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed? How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people. 

Also? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment. It's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be Tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks."
5,"Went there again today with family from OOT, they loved the food and the atmosphere. Just a fun, cool place, come on down."
5,Stopped in 10 minutes before close and ordered to go. The portions were huge and the food was outstanding. Probably the best jerk sauce I've ever had. Will be returning soon!
1,"I had one hour for lunch, and had heard this was one of the best places in town. I expected the lunch combo would come with a cup of soup - but not here, even though lunch is hi-priced. The weather was cold, so I wanted soup. I ordered sizzling rice soup and some egg rolls. It took 45 minutes between the time I sat down and when I got my food! The soup was not sizzling, and had small round BURNT rice cakes floating in the cup. BURNT BLACK. I had ten minutes to eat and get back to the office, so I could not return my meal. I fished out the burnt pieces and ate quickly. Maybe this place had a good rep in the past, but I will never go back there!"
1,"Have been there several times and it's always super slow. It had been months since we had gone there so today we went there and the girl at the counter just finished a counter order, saw us, and went to drive through. We stood there for 15 minutes waiting for somebody to take our order. Fed up, we left and went to Culver's."
5,"If I could give Dr. Stock and his staff 10 stars, I would.  Dr. Stock at the Dobson location is professional, knowledgeable, thorough, compassionate, and spends a great deal of time with his patients.  His staff including Lynn, and ultrasound technician, Mary, are so kind and attentive.  If your child has a heart defect, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Dr. Stock.  We have the utmost confidence in him."
1,"HORRIBLE experience. Got a couple of the Groupons thinking it was a good deal and bc my dad grew up in Phoenix and we used to come here a while ago for their formerly good food and service. However, we will never be back again and opted not to even use our balance because of how poorly we were treated. The Groupon actually expired yesterday and I was really tired but was going to make the 40 minute drive anyways but I thought I'd call and just check to see if they would extend the offer til today as some company's are courteous in that way. I spoke to a gentleman on the phone and explained that I knew my Groupon was expiring that night but would they let me come today for the deal and he said yes that would be fine. So today I make the drive and was told ""no"" by the girl behind the counter. I explain the whole situation about calling last night and that I spoke to a guy and she just said ""I know who you spoke to but that's not our policy so you can't get the deal.""  No apology or attempt to rectify the situation.  I should probably add that there was NO ONE there and she could have easily extended our offer and established return customers but she had no custom service skills. When I asked her name she said it is Courtney but it looks like she has replied to reviews on here as ""Anna S."" so who knows. And after reading more reviews about ppl who have gotten food poisoning after eating here recently maybe it's for the better!"
1,ER was slow... Checked in at 3:00pm and left with no doctor visit after 5hours. Ppl being seen before me were in there for hours! And only 3 people got to see the doctor with in that 5hours. I don't know how long they've been waiting either.
1,"after my delicious first wrap, i went in here again and got the alota fajita with beef.

it was disgusting. i had two bites and spit the second one out. the beef was gritty and seasoned weird. the green peppers and onions were stringy and not nicely textured.

my salsa was watery and it had one huge tomato chunk it. the chips were STALE.

wtf, mate?"
5,"First introduced because they were serving food at a charity event I attended. I really liked the BBQ sandwich and I liked that they give back to the community so I decided to try them for lunch one day.  It was delish...and, they have yummy fries which they hadn't served at the event.  Since then, I've been back in with the family and small groups and ordered their party platters/dishes for events at my house and everyone has loved the food.  The staff is always helpful. The place is always clean. What more could you ask for?"
5,"Foreword:  You may see that all my reviews are 5 stars (with the exception of one really horrible experience (I won't mention any names....*cough-MATADOR-cough*) reason being you may ask...I only feel compelled to share the really good ones, or really bad as the case may be ;)

Ok, to the business at hand...TDJ is HOTT from the chips with the amazing red chile salsa to the check this place is ON IT!!

I have been addicted to this place here lately and I can't get enough, what can you ask for in a good nosh spot....consistency baby, this place nails it....always good, never a disappointment!

So far I have tried about 6 different menu items...everything from the machca plate to the cheese enchiladas...right on the money!  I would say about as authentic as you can find my friends....

Not sure....but everything is soooo gooood that I may just try the ""lengua"" here soon....still a bit freaky, but I have to assume the same high quality will grace my plate!

Please don't be fooled by the well, quite frankly scary exterior...this place has what it needs on the inside....cold beer, amazing chips, mind blowing salsas....consistent service (even when it's busy) and great food!!

Well, what are you doing still reading this?  Don't stand on ceremony here people...run don't walk to this one!!"
5,The food is awesome and the decor is great.  I've eaten here a few times and never been disappointed.
5,I think some of the best Chinese food in Madison.  A little pricey but a few dishes always feeds me for at least two additional meals.
1,"So far this company has been VERY disappointing. Unfortunately they  have the market cornered for laundry pick-up and delivery service in Madison so at this point we really don't have the option of finding someone else. Maybe because Lazybones primary caters to students (what student can afford this??) they think they can do a terrible job at customer service and nobody will notice. They picked up our laundry on Monday. It was supposed to be delivered on Tuesday. It was not. We made sure that they had our waiver so they can leave it on the porch. It was not delivered on Wednesday. I get home yesterday evening (Thursday) and lo and behold, NO LAUNDRY! Really people? Okay I'm out of underwear. Of course by the time you get home and discover that they did not deliver your clean laundry, once again, the office is closed! They attempted to deliver on Wednesday at 3:30 and, despite our waiver, did not just leave it on the porch. The reason why we are using this service is because my husband and I are NOT HOME often. Via email and phone calls we tried to work this out all week and we thought they were clear on our needs but, alas, I am still underwear-less.
As I mentioned, there is no other business like this in town, so we are really hoping they pull it together and we can make it work. I remain dubious due to the fact that this national chain seems to have no actual humans operating the branch in Madison."
1,"Well I'm an Phoenician born AZ native so I've frequented the Phoenix Zoo many, many times throughout my life but after the trip today I don't think I'll be going back. It was so very sad to see so many tired looking, bored out their gourd, animals (they looked elderly) subjected to equally tired old surroundings. Many of the animal facilities were closed barring viewing of the animals at all. Display plaques educating the touring viewer were damaged. Often, audio push-button materials were broken. Staff and caretakers seemed to have no charisma or enthusiasm. Everything and everyone seemed quite jaded. The entire facility seemed to seethe of ways to further separate the visiting guest from the contents of his/her wallet with countless inflationary concession stands, gift shop memorabilia, carnival type rides. They were sickeningly blatant and expensive. The up side? It was a beautiful day with plentiful sunshine and little to no discernable air pollution. From now on I think I'll go to the zoo off Northern Ave. Though I understand it is much more expensive for admission, I just can't justify patronizing the Phoenix Zoo in its current state."
5,"My wife and I went on Yelp's Date Night at the AZ Science Center during the final weekend for the Van Gogh exhibit.  What a fantastic experience!

The Van Gogh exhibit was amazing.  Kudos to Sensory4 (the organization that created it) for doing a great job of telling the story of Vincent Van Gogh's life through only his paintings, quotes from his letters to his brother Theo, and music.  It was very moving.  Van Gogh was further cemented in my heart as my favorite painter.

In addition to seeing Van Gogh, Yelp provided some light snacks, a scavenger hunt, and entrance to most of the museum and the Planetarium.  Thank you, Yelp, for arranging this.  it was the 2nd Yelp event my wife and I attended and can't wait to see more."
1,"Oh NYPD Pizza. You seriously disappointed me. 

My husband and I stopped in on Saturday around 1pm. We were seated quickly since the restaurant wasn't busy but it took us 15 minutes for a waiter to come by. FIFTEEN minutes. A different waiter dropped off two waters when we sat down, but other than that - no one even acknowledged us. We had to stop another waitress and ask who are waiter was - and she seemed super confused. 

Finally Connor rolls around. Doesn't apologize for the wait - just seems nonchalant about taking our order. 

We split the chopped salad and had a few slices of pizza. The pizza was fine but don't bother with the chopped salad - not worth $10 at all. I think we counted a grand total of 4 tiny pieces of sun dried tomatoes and 8 quarter pieces of cucumber. 

We were never checked on during our dining experience until my husband was taking the last bite of pizza crust, Connor asked us how was the food. Really? Water was never refilled and extra napkins never appeared. 

We won't be coming back."
5,"Great food... Had red curry chicken with rice, egg rolls, raggoons... And hot&sour soup... All but the soup was above average in taste!! The hot and sour soup has a strong vinegar taste, not a fan of."
5,While it was 49.99 for the wax and buff i highly recommend it.  the wax guy was careful and thoughtful.  It looked great.
1,"Do NOT go to this restaurant if you can't use stairs. The dining room has about a dozen stairs (for everyone) and does NOT have an elevator or wheel chair lift. The restaurant manager wanted to send our group OUTSIDE, and re-enter the dining room via the back door. In addition, the restaurant staff has no training on ADA compliance."
5,Wow... what a great time at he yelp event.!!! Very impressive night.
1,"This place is awful.  

Drinks are way overpriced and weaker than a popcorn fart.

The place is filthy inside and smells like a old, sweaty jock strap.

Staff is slower than molasses and you'd see the Minnesota Vikings in the Super Bowl before you get served.

Always a testicle festival.  No hot single chicks here.  

Rather buy a 12 pack of Ultra and spend my Friday night under a bridge.

Go Packers!!!!!!"
5,"I adore this restaurant. I just love it. I've eaten here more than a dozen times. It's a shame I haven't gotten around to writing any reviews. So here I go!

Good to be able to see the kitchen. Not the cleanest in the world, but it certainly doesn't scare me off. The head chef/owner NEVER takes any days off. He's always there, cooking up a frenzy. I admire his work ethic.

The food is amazing. Love the Dragon Eggs (crispy) for the appetizer. Their Galee Gai is simply delicious. Their awesome soup Tom Yum Gai is worthy of an award. 

You can go anywhere you want on this menu and you won't make any wrong turns.

The ONLY comment (note that it's not a complaint) is that some of their servers do not have full command of the English language. Knowing that they emigrated from Thailand and seeing their extremely cheerful disposition just makes everything ok. Just speak slowly and be understanding: they are, after all, in a big and strange country. If you happen to have the same server I had, just smile and be nice. You'll be justly rewarded! 

This restaurant sets the standard of service, food quality and overall experience. I cannot wait to go back."
1,I don't know why I continue to go here and expect things to change. I've had the pizza here once and it was great. Breakfast however is entirely different.  They can't cook eggs !!!  Always runny and under cooked. The place is usually freezing cold and I think the music is played so loudly that it will take your mind off your cold food. Really disappointed as I live only a block away.  They might want to send some of there cooks to the Breakfast Club for a refresher course.
1,This place has NEVER gotten our order right.  Not once.  Lame.
1,"The staff was so RUDE! 1st door guy said we could come in for free anytime Fri night. We came back about 20 min later. Different door guy and some old ladies who would not let us in, said we had to each pay $10. The place was ghetto and empty. We went back to Bar Smith (next door) who had much nicer staff, no cover, great drinks & drink prices, and awesome music. Sorry Sky Lounge, you suck."
1,"I should listen to the warning signals that go off in my head when I enter an establishment that proudly displays a sign which reads:  ""YOU WANT IT WHEN?"", depicting a bunch of cartoon people rolling around on the floor laughing. That speaks VOLUMES about what kind of customer service is to be expected. This is the WORST dry cleaner I have ever gone to, bar none. Three times now I have paid top dollar to have Betsey Johnson dresses cleaned, only to have them returned looking exactly the same as when I dropped them off. Before last week, the last dress I had brought in (which cost me $12.00 on eBay, and that included shipping) cost me $22.00, $11.00 for the dress itself, & $11.00 for the polyester under-slip. There was a spot on the dress when I brought it in which was still there when I picked it up, however, since there was no notification that the spot couldn't be removed, I thought I was going home with a clean dress--as was the case with both other dresses. Btw, DANA argued with me and implied that I am a liar because I said that none of the three items had a tag on them indicating there was a spot that couldn't be removed. Because I had already had two experiences in the past with spots that weren't spot-cleaned, I decided to try hand washing the third dress before donating it to Goodwill...lo & behold, the spot came out. Customers get sick of going back, wasting PRECIOUS time & more money to get things done right, which was why I decided not to bring that particular dress back in. Last week I decided to give them one more chance, so I brought in three dresses to be pressed & one sleeveless gauze top. One of the dresses has layers, but I was not advised when I dropped it off that pressing it would cost $17.00. The other two dresses evidently cost $11.00 apiece to press, & the gauze top about $7.00. At that time, I SPECIFICALLY ASKED for the price to press long dresses, & the clerk, Mayra, told me it would cost about a dollar less than the dry cleaning process. She did not mention A THING about the layered dress costing $6.00 more...evidently I was supposed to intuitively know that the question needed to be asked. In other words, A LIE BY OMISSION. So I spent around $46.00 for the pressing of three dresses & the dry cleaning of one cotton top. I had asked for an $11.00 discount on the current order based on the fact that they didn't do the job right on the last dress I had brought in, & the owner, DANA (DANA wanted me to be sure to mention DANA's name here...happy to oblige!) started shaking and hyperventilating because I told DANA I thought a discount was in order for the inconvenience, as well as the spot that was still present on the last dress after I got it home...which cost me $11.00. I don't think even wealthy people--which I am not--feel they have money like that to blow. I asked DANA what was WRONG with DANA, treating a customer this way, & DANA's response was that DANA is the owner & that DANA can treat me however DANA likes. Man, do I pity DANA's employees. I wasn't asking for an additional $11.00 refund for the extra charge to clean a SLIP. Anyway, evidently DANA would rather make herself sick than be kind/accommodating to a customer. In the two years I was their customer, I had asked twice to have spots re-cleaned, NOT FOR REFUNDS OR CREDITS, yet today DANA basically told me I am a malcontent because I don't like to spend tons of money for nothing. And then DANA said I complained EVERY TIME I picked something up...so DANA is a LIAR, too. Believe me, if I had had that many complaints prior to today, I would have stopped bringing my clothes there a long time ago...today's experience was the FOURTH strike, which is more chances than I give most people who take my money, do a substandard job & then try to blame me instead of doing the right thing by admitting they made a mistake. SPARE ME. And yes, I consider the way DANA treated me--& the job FASHION CLEANERS did--a form of r@pe, because unless I paid their price, I was powerless to get back what is mine (which didn't bother me so much until I paid them $22.00 FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING). DANA's complete lack of customer service--& outright RUDENESS to a customer who, in the past, had referred OTHER people to spend their money at Fashion Cleaners--ensured that I won't go back. DANA actually accused ME of being defensive!!!! The girl who waited on me, Mayra, admitted when I left that I had always been very kind in the past, until DANA had a total meltdown today--obviously DANA doesn't know HOW to take criticism. My advice to DANA:  If DANA can't stand the heat, DANA should get shrunk and out of the freakin' kitchen. DANA does not belong in a customer-service oriented profession. PATHETIC. Three strikes, and I gave them the GIFT of another. YOU'RE OUT! ADDENDUM: THE ELASTIC SMOCKING ON TWO BRAND NEW DRESSES WAS COMPROMISED (PERMANENTLY STRETCHED OUT IN SOME PLACES) BY WHATEVER METHOD THEY USED TO ""PRESS"" MY DRESSES. BBB, HERE I COME!"
5,I stayed at the Hotel San Carlos and they are partnered with this gym. It's a block away from the hotel. Well equipt gym. I was able to have an excellent workout.
1,"We went for dinner on Sunday evening.  The restaurant was not crowded, and it was Memorial Day weekend, so perhaps everyone was traveling.  I've been going to Avanti for thirty years and always had a good experience.  This is the first time that I was so utterly unimpressed and even commented that I would not be returning.  Not only was the food mediocre but the service was impudent at best.

Our waiter asked if we wanted drinks.  I asked for a listing of wines by the glass, and he basically refused to give me a written listing.  He asked whether I wanted red or white, and I said red.  My friend said she preferred a red zinfandel and asked if they had zinfandel. I said I would like to know something about the wine I was ordering, and the waiter said they had a good Rombauer in both cabernet and zinfandel and described it in glowing terms, adding that they also had house wine.  He mentioned $8 and we thought he was talking about the Rombauer.  We ordered the Rombauer - one cab and one zin.  When we got the bills, the wine was $18, so we asked if he had billed us for two glasses.  No, he said, the Rombauer was $18 a glass.  I said ""you didn't tell us that"" and he said he was sure he had....  Well, we looked at the wine list by the glass on the way out of the restaurant.  The Rombauer wasn't even listed, and they had no wines by the glass for more than $15.  We felt the whole thing was a rip-off and will not be returning."
1,"I came here years ago to see Henry Rollins Spoken word. (Totally awesome by the way: five stars.) The seats here though were absolutely HORRENDOUS! Now I'm 5'11"" so I'm used to not having a lot of leg room so I'm used to sitting sideways so my knees aren't banging into the seat in from of me. Here, legs to the side and I'm still rammed up against the next row. It was like being in a three hour yoga pose. 

I have never before and never since seen rows of seats so close to eat other. Only my sister in law could sit comfortably and she's 5'1"". Come on Celebrity Theatre, just a couple more inches. Size really does matter. If anyone told you otherwise, they were lying."
1,"Do NOT. I repeat - do not do business with this company. 

We purchased a furnace with an extended warranty. The warranty was for 650.00 and we were told it would cover any defects, issues etc. Within 2 years the blower motor went out on a Friday. They advised us it would be 198.00 per hour since it was overtime. This was at 3pm on a Friday. They told me to read the fine print..... you know the drill. Finally after much run around I was told we would have a man out for no charge Monday morning at 8am. Of course no one showed up. after 3 more calls and missed times finally we had a tech arrive at 12noon. They do NOT do what they say, they are rude, and not the least bit proactive. Beware of any promises the sales persons make and any comittments the company makes."
1,"Avoid. Expensive wine list and our waiter pulled a wine scam on me.  The wine list here is ridiculously expensive. I ordered the least expensive bottle of Chianti for $32 ( what they call ""house"",  and this is not a fancy place) and I got attitude for it!  Our waiter asked: ""Wasn't I sure I wanted the next step up at $38?"" I did not want to pay more. Even after I accepted the tasting, the wandering owner of the place shot our waiter a look like ""dig Mr. Cheapskate over there..."" The waiter poured three half glasses from our bottle. Then the waiter took the bottle away. ( Bad sign, in retrospect) When I asked for the rest of the bottle, he said we finished it! I know wine bottles and there were  more than three half glasses in that bottle. I asked if he was sure and he said yes. Rather than create a scene with my party - a buzz kill for sure to argue over this -  I ordered three more glasses  - at an additional $24. The waiter opened a new bottle, poured, and guess what, there was about a half bottle left!  I was not happy! Not happy about the brazen attitude for ordering a $32 bottle or the very short first bottle. I think I was scammed.  Every order should be respected. The food was good, I admit, and reasonably priced but it must act as a lure to soak you on the wine. They do carry out and this would be the only way to enjoy this place, in my opinion.Better yet, try someplace else."
1,"I'm so disappointed in Union Cab. A company that usually has excellent customer service refused my husband and me a ride not once, but twice, to a location less than five minutes away from the airport. While I understand it was busy, the rudeness and refusal of a short fare for a larger or is completely unacceptable. It will be a long time before I choose to use them again."
1,"Just can't get decent pizza in Wisconsin... sorry... but someone needs to head down to Chicago and learn how to make a pizza.

This place piles sauce and toppings on a crust that can't support it.  you end up with a slide off mess.  Flimsy crap."
1,"Bland, blech, barf. 

That's pretty much how I feel about Wild Thaiger. The food here is the farthest thing from authentic as it could get without venturing into Lean Cuisine territory. I suppose, though, it was the closest us downtowners had to real Thai, until Thai Hut and Thai Elephant moved in. (You are on notice, Wild Thaiger!) 

I think I gave it a fair shake. I ate here a total of four times, with different people and different food. I was not impressed once. In fact, I was pretty disgusted twice to find a long black hair weaving itself through my molded mound of rice. 

No spice. No life. No business from me."
5,"Now that they have a delivery service I love them even more! Your great food delivered downtown Phoenix via BikeForceUS couriers is as ""green"" as it gets! RideOn!!! Love you guys :)"
5,"Tiffany is, by far, the best stylist I've ever had.  I recently moved to DC and have let my hair go for 6 months because I knew I'd be back home in Madison around Christmas and could sneak into Ultimate and get my hair done right.

When I first started going to Tiffany, I did what every girl does post-break-up.  I sat in her chair and told her I didn't care what she did with my hair but that I needed something different.  She gave me the perfect cut and color.  I was stopped multiple times by strangers asking me where I had gotten my hair cut.  It was stylish and professional - plus, I could just blow dry it into shape, no need to curl or use a straightening iron.

Love this place!"
1,"Horrible customer service!  Strangely rude and condescending.  I confronted them about their attitude, which was unnecessary.  I know when poor service is justified as I've been in the industry and given it myself!  It was unjustified and quite odd, actually.  

We politely (key word) asked where a few of the ingredients were that the menu listed for our meal and that's when they became defensive and quite weird about it. Strangely rude and almost demeaning, saying it was a waste to send it back.  

The pizza was slopped together the first AND the second time, and I don't even trust what they did to it in the kitchen.  Yes, this is the feel I got from them, being our server, Zach and the other man whom I believe to be the bartender or the manager.   

We were running a pretty high drink bill and there was no need for the negative energy. It ruined our experience and vibe of the place.  Over a pizza?  Poor service, poor choices."
1,"Not even the hungriest, rabid infested pack of Chihuahuas would touch this food. All their food is canned process nonsense. It's like Mc Donalds on Mescaline. Now the freshly made tortillas are good, but that's it."
1,"I'm from Chicago and dying for some fantastic tasting ribs, other than those that I BBQ myself. Everyone pointed me to Honey Bear's BBQ.

The place is clean and casual, and the service is OK. But the ribs were horrible. The beer was fantastic though and I first thought maybe the alcohol had dulled my taste buds. I remember screaming, ""Either this is a poor cut of beef/pork or both animals had mad cow/pig disease!""

I decided to return and give them another chance, and not order alcohol. I ordered the ribs and again, ""Mad Cow Disease!""

I won't ever return. How does that go: ""First time shame on you, second time shame on me..."""
5,"called at 5:15pm.  they closed at 5:30 but told me to come by.  I wish I knew the name of the woman who washed, cut and styled my hair as well as plied me with champagne AND did my makeup.  I am not from Phoenix but if I was I would never go anywher else."
5,"Excellent Thai food! A must-visit place form those who love Asian food. Food is superb. Service is excellent, and the prices are VERY reasonable. Hope they open more locations in the valley!"
1,"This place is horrible. So, so horrible. Please don't get your car washed here! This is a quick and convenient car wash for me, and I am just so over it. I will make the hike to Los Olivos, because Danny's is just awful. They don't vacuum the back of the car, wipe off my door handles, wipe down the cup holders. Nothing. They mess with all of my seats, don't fix the door mats, then give me a dirty look when I don't tip them. What do they expect?"
5,"Dear fucking lord I am not going to eat again until next Thursday.

A friend took me here for lunch today, in exchange for a little 'puter help. The cook is a friend of hers, he just said, don't worry I'll make something you like.

Next thing I knew I had a Scheiners freshly made hot dog, grilled, split open, on a bun... with a fried egg an some of their pepper concoction on top. One of the best things I have ever ever eaten. 

As others mentioned, the fries are sliced to order and fried to a super crisp.

The eggs are organic. The menu is tiny, it's diner food, but the food quality is very, very high. 

Has a few bites of a freshly made pear pie.... oh my.

I will be back, but not that often, otherwise I'll be a lardass. (again)"
5,"I consider myself a bit of a Protestant mutt: baptized Lutheran; raised in the Anglican church; confirmed Presbyterian; and in college, I was adopted by the Jesuits.  And I can't say that church has ever come easy.  In my youth, I went kicking and screaming. During adolescence, foremost, I went out of respect for my parents; but it was a perspiration.  Now, as an adult, with a blended family of five kids, I find my weekly pilgrimage to church an aspiration and inspiration.  I go to disconnect from worldly distraction.  It's a chance to meditate, listen to music, hear an inspired perspective, and to commune with others, and to pause and be grateful.  CUMC is a new home.  We moved here just five months ago.  They offer three services, all with the same message, but delivered with a very different experience - 8 am is quiet and intimate in a quaint chapel; 9:30 is contemporary ... ""Jesus, Java, Jazz"" - eat donuts, drink coffee, enjoy amazing guest artists; 11 am is the traditional service in the main sanctuary, with all the traditional trimmings and an amazing choir to boot.   We have settled into the ease and familiarity of JJJ.  The church community is so warm and welcoming.  If you find yourself interested in renewing your faith, or taking cautious steps in your spiritual discovery and journey, consider CUMC. You will be most welcomed."
