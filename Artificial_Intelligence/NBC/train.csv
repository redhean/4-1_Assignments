5,"So I was in Madison the other day picking up my carpooler near the East Town Mall and I admit....I was trying to find anything that would give me a caffeine buzz....okay I admit it, I was seeking out a Starbucks because at this point....Anything will do!! 
I Yelped Coffee Shops nearby and got this little gem! Too cute! Coffee was awesome and also got a bagel to go. The scene inside was comfy and cozy, too bad I had to jet, otherwise I would have enjoyed sipping on my java inside instead of on the highway! I am happy I know about this place tucked back off the well beaten path!"
5,"i agree with kelly. the staff is really knowledgeable about their wines and i love the variety. the atmosphere is excellent. depending on when you go, you can get good baristas or not-so-good baristas. but when you get a good one, the whole place is absolutely fabulous."
1,"Extremely poor service and attitude!  I had a reservation for a Saturday night using the Groupon offer that expires in a few days and is only good for Saturdays.
They refused to accept it even though they accepted the reservation knowing I had a Groupon.  Their attitude was terrible!  I would never attempt to go there again."
1,"Service was not good, they forgot about us after our dinner was served. Chips tasted stale."
1,"I took my BMW here because the dealership I purchased it from (used) took it here to have an oil leak repaired.  First off, the oil leak was ""repaired"" only to find out later that it really wasn't.  Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket, which either occurred when this shop put the part in, or they purchased it with the defect, but either way, the problem was missed on their part, which tells me they do not pay attention to detail.  

So, when we noticed the leak was still an issue, it was under warranty through this shop for the original work, so I took it back.  I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley, they did repair it, however later that day my ""service engine"" light came on, then went off.  A few days later, I parked my car, turned it off, and went to start it again after picking up my mail, and the car would not start.  Thankfully, my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty), we towed my vehicle back to my house, which was only down the road, but it was dead.  Come to find out, the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way, which is what tripped my ""service engine"" light a couple of days before, and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle, the vehicle finally wouldn't start.  My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak), and there have been zero issues since.

Now, I'm not sure if this shop did this on purpose, or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well.  But, given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn't notice was defective or they messed up themselves, and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished, I am not very happy.  On top of it, I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance!), and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son, and I were both sick at the time.

I would NEVER recommend this shop to anyone, I will never ever go back, and I also intend on notifying the dealership I purchased my vehicle from of the issues in the hopes that they choose another BMW shop in the future to service any used BMW's that come onto their lot.  What a complete and utter nightmare."
1,"A good friend and I were in downtown Phoenix at lunchtime.  I was excited we might eat at one of my favorites along Central (Postino, Fez, Windsor).  But, since it was really my friend's day, when she asked about restaurants, I deferred, ""What did you have in mind?""  She said ""How about The Old Spaghetti Factory"".  I tried not to let my lip curl in disgust (I dislike all chain Italian restaurants).  But, again, deferring to her, I said ""Sure, I always like to try new places."" 

We were seated fairly promptly.  The decor was kitschy, but we had a nice table with comfy chairs.  Our waiter brought bread and took our drink order.  I asked if their iced tea was caffeine free, he said ""Oh yes, we brew it ourselves.""  WHAT?!?.  Just because they brew it instead of taking it from a soda gun doesn't guarantee it's caffeine free.

Having been there before, my friend knew she wanted the lasagna.  Being Italian, I never order lasagna in restaurants as I know mine is better ( I make 2 kinds of lasagna, regular that just takes a few hours, and then the grand dame,  lasagna bolognese, which takes 2 days, with all the braising and creating 2 separate sauces).  I had a bad vibe theirs wouldn't hold a candle to even my ""lazy"" lasagna.  I chose spaghetti with mizithra and brown butter, supposedly their signature dish.  All entrees come with bread, soup or salad, and tea or coffee.

Our waiter took our order.  My friend asked for the lunch portion of lasagna.  The waiter replied ""Oh, we don't have lunch portions of the lasagna, just dinner size."".  My first thought: it's FROZEN.  My second thought: nice way to up-sell buddy.  She had cream of broccoli soup and I had salad with pesto ranch on the side.  Our waiter delivered the soup and salad, but forgot the dressing.  He said he'd be right back with it.  When we flagged him down 5 minutes later, he was surprised I had no dressing, saying ""I told the busboy to bring it to you.""  This must have been the same busboy who was so busy doing anything but his job that a nearby table remained uncleared during our entire meal.  Soon, he dropped off a small silver dish containing a pesto ranch popsicle.  Yes, the dressing was FROZEN.  I had to stir it so it would thaw enough to pour.  The salad was a big plate of pedestrian iceberg, cabbage and carrots with packaged croutons that appeared as if they had been chopped in half to stretch them.

My friend was sorely disappointed with her lasagna, saying it didn't taste like she remembered from past visits.  I told her it was probably because it was frozen pre-packaged, which was why they couldn't cut it into lunch portions.  My spaghetti with mizithra was so bland, I'm sure any finicky toddler or nursing home patient with a digestive disorder could have tolerated it (and I'm not insulting seniors or anyone with digestive issues, as my husband suffers from one, I'm just commenting on the utter lack of flavor in this dish).  Where's the garlic?  Where's the nutty goodness of brown butter?  I don't think what they used ever came from a cow, I'm quite sure it was industrial grade margarine.  

Sadly, even their bread wasn't all that flavorful.  It looked and smelled good when it first arrived hot to the table, but shortly after, it seemed extremely flavorless and the ""butter"" added nothing.

All I could think was ""Robert Irvine would have a field day trying to fix this place on Restaurant:  Impossible!"", then I remembered he doesn't work with chains.  As Daniel D alluded, Olive Garden would have been a better choice."
1,I purchased the living social deal for the six organic pedicures. I had a very hard time scheduling an apt. When I finally did get in the experience was horrible. I was expecting a massage chair or something similar but was seated in a hard high back chair that you needed to put pillows behind your back to try to get comfortable. The experience was strange because they use an aloe jelly that makes you think that you are sticking your feet in a big bowl of green jello. That part honestly was weird but not bad just squishy :) . The bad part was the mud and salt scrub that left my legs raw and red. The pedicure ended with them putting my shoes back on to paint my toes. It was a strange and uncomfortable pedicure to be sure but the lady who performed it was very nice so I did tip her. Unlike the front desk help who would rather be on their personal phones talking about Face Book instead of check me out in a timely manner. I wrote a review before but it was taken down so I'm hoping there isn't anything here that is too much. This was just my experience and I'm happy to say I will not be going back.
1,"Food is good but the bartender Stephanie is rude and ignores customers but caters to the regulars,  it seems like she hates her job and is miserable,  poor management and not so friendly employees,   I called and left a message to speak to Christo or wife Gloria but of course manager intercepted the message so I never received a call back from either,  I hope that Christo would read  these reviews him self so he knows what goes on when he""s not around.  I will never return or refer anyone and will make sure to let everyone know how rude u employees are specially bartender Stephanie...."
5,"Despite being around for 20 years now, US Airways Center remains a great place to see a game, concert, or other special event.

I've been here numerous times over the years and always had a great time. Most recently I attended the Fleetwood Mac concert and before that a Suns-Pacers Game.

There's really not a bad seat in the house, restrooms and food are conveniently located throughout the building and while the ladies room often has a line at the end of an event, when everyone is leaving at once, according to my wife, its generally not too bad.

Unlike other cities that built arenas on the cheap and now have to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars to build new arenas or risk losing their team (cough, cough, Sacramento), Phoenix should be proud that US Airways Center was built right to begin with and the City has continued to maintain and make improvements throughout its history. 

Now if the Suns can just turn things around..."
1,Cool historic building but the service at lunch today was mediocre at best and stay away from the Chicken Parmigiana unless you like fishy tasting chicken.  The best part of my experience was the bread and butter.  :(
1,"We just moved back into the hood from Anthem and man what a BUMMER this Safeway is. I LOVE LOVE LVE LVE LEV LOVE LOOOOVE Safeway. I will drive any distance to shop at a Safeway - what a bummer this is only 1/2 a mile from my house. 

Went last night and was utterly appalled at the mess of a store I walked into. The aisles were a disaster - product was thrown everywhere or was completely out. I thought this was a grocery store? A place to buy FOOD?

One checkout line open and a miserable employee ringing. If I wasn't in the middle of baking dessert at home I would have tossed the ingredients I needed back on the shelves and gotten the hell outta there. 

Thank GOD the Safeway on Osborn is only a short ride away."
1,"The store manager is lazy, rude and unhelpful. Same with the assistant manager Charlie. I feel really bad for the reps who have to work under such poor management.  I got no help from anyone when it was clearly a problem caused by someone at that store.  The manager refused to take me off speakerphone even when it was obvious that the echo in his tiny, depressing office was making it impossible to communicate. GO TO THE ARCADIA STORE AT THOMAS AND 44TH. MUCH BETTER!! BOYCOTT THE CAMELBACK STORE!"
1,"I need to tell you about the worst hostess experience I've EVER had anywhere.  Ann was unable and unwilling to even pretend to try and accomodate our simple seating request to have our 2 parties sit near each other, even though I'd made my reservation 2 weeks in advance withthat specific request.  Her attitude was unacceptable."
5,"Sigh.  I'm in love.  If only I lived closer to Cheuvront.  Maybe I'll move downtown just to be closer....

My husband and I went in on a Saturday night for a few glasses of wine.  Once we saw the desserts, however, we knew we had to try it!  I ordered the pumpkin bread pudding which was very good (it wasn't the Harvard Faculty Club, but then again...what is?) and my husband selected the coconut pie.  Both servings were huge and covered in whipped cream.  They were fantastic.  Finally, a place to go for dessert here!

We chose to sit at the bar and the bartender was amazing.  He offered us complimentary tastings of two delicious dessert wines and then even offered us a complimentary mini cheese sampler with an amazing sheep's milk cheese.  The atmosphere was perfect, it was laid back, kind of cafe/bistro-ish but still modern.  They were playing The Food Network which I absolutely loved...I've never seen that in a restaurant before! It was a great touch.   The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced.

They have a wonderful wine dinner with four courses for only $55 a person!  I'm eager to attend one in the future and I definitely plan on going back for dinner in the near future.


And that folks, was my 400th review. :)"
5,"One of the greatest treasures of Madison. There's no better place to simply relax and enjoy the beauty and variance of nature. 
The only downside: the inevitable disrespectful patrons. Particularly when it comes to the Thai Pavilion. Usually this means people with kids, but just as often applies to adults that can't seem to understand the words ""Please don't touch""."
1,"I get all my crafting supplies from
This store.  It's an awesome place to shop if you know what your looking for."
5,"Love the sour dough bread...they make great grilled cheese. The bagels aren't too bad......they will make due until the next time you get to New York. My favorite bagel is a fresh asiago cheese with tons of cream cheese. Yum!  The broccoli cheese soup is also very tasty.  I love that they have cage free eggs and antibac free chicken. I appreciate that they are starting to care more about the products they are serving. The only question I have is this...are the chickens free range? 

This Panera is rather loud and always busy."
1,"Ok, seriously, I gave this place 1 star but only because they have my favorite Irish Ale on tap - and they should because it's an Irish pub.  I suppose it would be an ""okay"" place if you want to hang out in a neighborhood bar and play pool and/or video games and drink at a mediocre price.  I read on their white board that they have a live blues band a couple of nights a week (Fri/Sat maybe?), which, if they're decent, could be pretty cool.

Anyway, let me walk you through my experience...

It's Tuesday night and my friends want to go to a karaoke place.  Why they chose this place I will never know.  I was actually a little scared when we walked up.  Some of the patrons were outside smoking and they looked a little rough around the edges.  Now, I'm really not one to judge based solely on appearance, but...  I digress.

The bar itself is laid back.  Wood paneling, some high tables, low tables, long bar with stools.  Plenty of room for big groups.  I would say there were a couple dozen people there which is pretty good for a Tuesday night.  I didn't visit the bathroom because I was scared to see what it looked like.

The bartender was just ok.  I got my first drink (draft beer) pretty quickly.  However, when I went up to the bar for a second beer, the bartender was nowhere to be found.  I stood there for about 10 minutes.  She finally came back in after her smoke break and poured me a beer.  I still tipped her because that's how I roll.

The karaoke was AWFUL.  The song selection was large, but I couldn't seem to find any of my regular songs, which are popular hip-hop songs from the current decade.  If you're into singing Limp Bizkit, Metallica, Pantera and other songs from way back in the day, this place is definitely for you.  You will be entertained by middle-aged obese men moshing next to their table and growling into the microphone, while the host either sings uninvited backup or makes out with her boyfriend.  But that's not even the best part.

My friends and I wanted to sing a specific song and the host overheard us.  She said cool.  We tipped her (heavily) so she would move us up in the rotation.  We waited about 20 minutes.  Then, she came over and said she didn't have that song.  Surprise.  We asked her to move our other songs up in the rotation and she said no problem, but she did ask me to change my selection (?) for some reason.  I didn't and I really wish I could have gotten my money back.

It's the most ridiculous karaoke experience I have ever had in my life and I won't be repeating it... ever.  I guess that's what I get for going to a local Irish pub to do karaoke!"
5,Great food. Friendly staff. No complaints.
5,"Mexican food is funny because it's one cuisine that we tend to have so many favorites in that we need to make sub-categories. As such Comedor Guadalajara would be filed in my database as the Mexican seafood place that I won't eat all day in anticipation of over-eating at. This is a very thin category, in fact it's the only one. The Veracruz style snapper is single-handedly responsible for keeping me from moving to another city. The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample portion of fresh snapper  in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich tomato sauce. If that's not enough, you have the option to add shrimp. 

If I'm not feeling like eating off the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy. 

Service is always quick and friendly here. Decor is not the most inspiring here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor. Folks of my pale pigment may pass on this place because it's location is rather industrial and low rent. That's fine by me, they can go to Macayo's and I'll take my usual booth under the spray painted swordfish."
5,"I have been ordering coffee from Johnson Brothers for years.  The company sources the best beans from all major coffee-producing areas (often single origin).  More importantly, the company is dedicated to supporting eco-friendly production methods and is certified Fair Trade.
While I value social responsibility in companies, what counts most is the quality of the product.  In this regard, the expertly roasted beans from Johnson Brothers afford coffee drinkers with an amazing array of taste experiences, similar to fine wines.  
The fact that these outstanding coffees are sold at very fair prices and can be ordered without shipping costs (order of 3 bags or more) is another reason why I am a dedicated Johnson Brothers Coffee fan."
1,"decent bbq (gets waaaay more hype than it deserves really) that is hampered by the fact that i have gotten mediocre-to-bad service every time. i usually stick to only good reviews but this weekend was the last straw.

brother and i went in saturday 041214 to use a Groupon and it was a hassle- if you don't want to deal with Groupons, you can always, y'know, NOT SIGN UP WITH THEM VOLUNTARILY. then we were told multiple different prices with the excuse 'uh, certain specials aren't allowed to be used'. well a) that isn't noted anywhere b) the items ordered were on the menu, not listed as 'special' c) they told us we had to order the full amount to get the discount, which is not how ANY Groupon deal i have used works (ie, the $20 credit wouldn't kick in until we ordered $20 worth of food. yeah, what? its a $20 credit! if we ordered $18, that means its all covered, not that we need to buy another side we didn't want!)

on top of that, we only got half our order at first, my brother went to ask about his and was told he cancelled the other half of the order. the part that was paid for and on the receipt? at this point he was pretty annoyed and the on duty manager came out and was condescending and telling him to calm down. then was told that his order was being made fresh so it was gonna be awhile- only to have it come up right then. this trip didn't make sense and they didn't really seem to care. not really in a rush to go back ever at this point. your bbq is ok, but i can go to Astor House up the street and not deal with this kind of headache.

i am not a bitchy, crabby person, i deal with the public all day and as such try to be understanding when situations come up and things take a while...but this is not an isolated incident and their attitude about it sucks."
5,"My husband and I were looking for a unique place to stay for our anniversary. We had looked into some area hotels but, the website of the Speckled Hen Inn B & B was very inciting and truly sparked our interest to try it.  SO GLAD WE DID!!

From the moment we were greeted by one of the owners, we felt welcomed and comfortable.  Beautifully clean, decorated and comfortable.  The room we chose was amazing....the privacy, quiet and relaxation was just what we wanted and loved.  
(luxurious bedding, tub and shower)

Breakfast was truly delicious and thoughtfully prepared.  Just one other couple was staying at the same time as we did and it was fun and interesting to have breakfast with them and the owners Pat and Bob.

Love their ""greeter"" Happy the dog...he is just as his name says...Happy (sweet and friendly too).

We were sad to go and look forward to coming back in the near future for more than just an overnight.

If you have never experienced staying at a B & B, THIS is the location to try.  Once you stay here other's will pale in comparison.

Madison WI is a neat city to investigate and is well worth the trip up North.....

Thanks to Pat and Bob...your doing a wonderful job...keep it up!"
1,"I brought my car in for an oil change and told them I had noticed that the front tires vibrated or shook at high speeds.  Left the car for them to check things out.  The called me to tell me I needed new tires, that there was uneven wear.  I told them to put them on and do a front end allignment.  When  I went to pick up the car, they told me it needed ball joints and tie rods, so they did not do the allignment (said it would have been a waste of money with the bad ball joints and tie rods).  When they discovered the problem with the tie rods and ball joints, they should have called me back.  Took it some place else to get a second opinion.  I was told Firestone should have never put new tires on the car when ball joints and tie rods were needed.  I will never go back to this Firestone."
1,"Please do not ever go here.  This is a public service announcement.  I do not even know you and I like you too much to suggest this place.

1- Prices?!  Are you kidding me?  $6 for a milkshake?  It was tiny.  Not to mention it was not much of a milkshake.  It was a peanut butter cup shake.  They took some peanut butter cups, crushed them and stirred them into custard with some milk.  I saw the whole process.  It was not very impressive whatsoever.  The flavor was ok.  

2 - The food.  I had a chili cheese dog.  This is my standard order when it is available on the menu.  The chili tasted like Hormel.  The hot dog was hot and the chili was warm.  I like that they have shredded cheese on it, rather than liquid cheese.

3 - My dining companion got a burger.  It tasted ok, but it was a very thing patty. He also ordered cheese curds with it.  They were so greasy and lacked any good flavor in the breading.  

Overall, we spent nearly $20 there and I was not satisfied with my meal.  Every talks so much about how great the custard is.  Nope.  Not good.  Go to Culver's!  Seriously, for $6 you can get something TWICE the size with more mix-ins.  Better yet?  Get a cone for you AND a friend."
5,"This place is the place to go for when you plan to throw a BIG MEXICAN/LATIN FIESTA!!! Si, si, si!!!!! :) 
:) They are awesome, It reminds me of Mexico and its Open-aired local markets. Great prices, freshly made corn Tortillas and its also the perfect place to request freshly grounded masa. Thats if you know how to make Tameles from scratch.
 I have never dined there, but food looks good!!  I LOVE THE AGUAS FRESCAS!!! OH SOO AMAZING Horchata, Fresa, Sandia and Papaya water!!!! :) YUM, YUM!!!
Great service, big smiles everywhere and a large variety of products and produce!!"
1,"Bad service, no bread, no drink refill , took 45min to get our first drink:( ouch , used to love this place but service sucks"
1,"""They don't need your help. You probably waited 5 min and have now wasted more time out of your life. Armed service people?!?
Yea so they can ask for a military discount for not being able to make a real life choice about direction. Take orders as a server , then talk to yelp bout educated disappointments of yours."" -CatchM T.
First of all this was my experience at this restaurant and I do not need any ""compliments"" from anyone telling me that it wasn't. Since you would like to know, I've never been a server because I do not want to be one but I'm sure it's so much more harder than being a ""armed service people"" (as you like to call them). I do however know a thing or two about customer service  (my review says the servers were standing around talking to one another meaning they could have easily taken the 10 seconds to walk over and say they were no longer taking anymore customers or whatever the reason was). The one thing people in customer service know is the customers pay your bills! Without them you're broke and out of business! That is why It doesn't matter if it's a $2 check or if business is doing so well that you don't need or care for any new customers, you should always treat the last customer just as good, if not better, than the first. I'm also sure people could care less but I can also talk to yelp A bout any educated disappointments I would like."
5,"Hard to find a good $100 burger (airport restaurant). Had an awesome BLT with great service and an ice tea for $10.90 plus tip. Place really hops at lunch time, for good reason."
5,"Looking for ""that"" spot where the moment you walk in, you fit in?  

Looking for a home cooked meal...without having to lift a finger? 

Looking for a place to pop a squat and shoot the shit?

Look no further than the Greenie!  

Breakfast, lunch, happy hour or dinner....it always fills the bill. 

Love taking the family there for weekend breakfast.  From the waffle sundae for my youngest to the seafood omelet for me...they have it all.  Huge portions...great prices! 

Swing in and ask for my favorite bartender, Joy to make you her ultimate bloody mary made with Effen Cucumber Vodka.  Yeah...she rocks it.  

It's all good..."
5,We use Fast Signs for the vinyl lettering on our service vans. Good prices and the colors hold up great in the AZ sun.
1,"Cheesy and totally overrated - the carribean fare in a Jimmy Buffet inspired setting is all good in theory, but the colorful interiors and catchy tunes are little compensation when you spend most of your time keeping flies away from your crappy food and balancing the BAD shaka-ritas (margarita flights) on creaky wooden tables in the patio.
The food was uniformly ordinary - my vegetarian baja burger was way too spicy to be enjoyable, the crab-cake burger was a disaster and I left my fries practically untouched, which hardly ever happens! Overall, one of the worst restaurant experiences for me."
5,"this place is on my list at least a couple times a month, and it's probably the only restaurant in madison that can claim that.  

The only thing I've got to say on the negative side is the crawfish off season are a bit mealy and I have switched to shimp.  everything else is spot on, esp the read beans and rice.  oh, and it's closed on  sunday...which is always the day you start to crave a po' boy. 

What do I say you get.  for 2 ppl, we get a full order of shrimp etoufee, shimp creole and a red bean and rice double meat.  all with french bread.  it's a ton of food but oh so good."
1,The worst experience I've ever had. I should have known better when they told us 15 minute wait turned to 40. Then finally seated by the door a crowd of people also waiting for to be seated standin behind us. We waited 15 then for our server to make his first appearance...we left. Ridiculous.
1,"The ABSOLUTE worse experience I have ever had ordering flowers! I made an order to have flowers delivered to my wife's work on Valentine's day. I looked at the exotic flower arrangements that Cactus Flower Florists carried. And I found one I knew my wife would love. They were a ""Birds of Paradise"" arrangement, we have just moved from Hawaii to Arizona and I thought it would be a great choice. I ordered and purchased the flowers and made sure that they would be able to be delivered by Feb. 14th Valentine's day. Well the day finally comes and my wife never gets the arrangements and when I call the florist to inquiry about the delivery a female employee, who I am later told name is Laura, tells me that the date of delivery was for Feb. 15th, now if I did not see that the flowers would have been delivered on valentine's day why would I schedule it for the day after, it kind of defeats the purpose, I would have looked somewhere else or just picked some up myself. Anyway she goes on to tell me they will not make any more deliveries that day. So I end the call now expecting them to deliver the arrangement on the 15th. Again the 15th is here and still by 330 p.m. my wife still has not received the flowers. I again call and ask about the delivery, after being transferred 3 times was told that on their system was a note saying that they had called me twice and left two messages (I never gotten any calls by them) that they did not have the birds of paradise flower and needed to have it replaced, this note was said by them to have been put in the system on the day I ordered the flowers. So not only did they say they called which they did not, but when I actually called them and spoke to a represenative nothing was told to me about this, nothing was ever mentioned about not having the flowers I ordered. Frustrated at the whole ordeal wanted it to be done with I agreed to let them send another ""exotic"" arrangement in its place. What my wife received that day was as pitiful arrangement as I have ever seen, not worth the over hundred dollars I spent. I could have pulled weeds out of my yard that were nicer! 
So to some it all up CACTUS FLOWER FLORIST is a sham and you should not waste your money here!"
1,"Worst McD's in the world wide Franchise!!! I live down the road and they consistently serve old, soggy fries!  The workers consistently sound irritable and commonly get your order wrong.  I usually would not waste my time reviewing a McD's but after 10+ visits to this McD's I am thoroughly dissatisfied.  Do your self a favor and drive down the road to the next McD.  Especially if you want hot, fresh, crispy McDonald's Fries!"
5,"Good food , excellent service from the hostess to the waiters! Attentive ,friendly ,quality, cleanliness a+"
5,"I hate to let a good secret out but these folks not only work on lawn mowers but have a trained and certified BMW mechanic on staff.  They were fast, did excellent work and were totally affordable and when fixing a BMW affordable is rarely a word used.  They work on other cars as well but I can't speak to that.  They also we t over my car and let me know what preventative work will be needed and about how much time I had to get it done.  Being new to Madison I was worried about finding a mechanic I could trust.  I'm not worried anymore."
1,This place is nothing wonderful. The croissants are nothing out of the world. They are half the size of what you would get else where and double the price. They are the most expensive I have had in all of US at $4.80 a piece!! They were stale and nothing great and this was in the morning at 8am. Go else where
5,"i love this cafe everything on the menu is super delicious... the bar is awesome wish there was a tid bit of more room here ... i had such an amazing expirience i will deffntly suggest this too everyone it is a must... the staff especially is amazing  and in uniform as well always  oh so busy even at the latest hour   the cookies are great and the whle theme is aswell..

 go for urself an expirience some great u deserve"
5,"Listen, the environment is awesome. I LOVED the furniture. It's been many years (16 maybe) since I have been to any Old Spaghetti Factory, so it was really like a new experience for me. 

Anywhoo, the staff were kind and super attentive. The waitress was amazeballs. She had an eagle-eye. We didn't want for anything while we were there, she predicted our every need. I can't remember her name :( or I'd give her a special shout out. (If you read this, and recall us complimenting you in your eagle-eye, please comment on this, so people know how fabulous you are.)

I had lobstah ravioli, and it was delectable! I would definitely do this again, and order that every time. Compliments to the chef(s)!!!

Thank you all for an awesome dining experience!!"
5,"One of the coolest grocery stores I've ever seen. Between a variety of self-service bars and posting how many food miles the items are, this location is definitely ahead of the curve with grocery stores, without charging out the wazoo like Whole Foods."
5,"My husband and I attended the yelp sponsored date night at the Arizona Science Center. We had a blast checking out all the hands-on exhibits as well as the planetarium. The Van Gogh Alive! was an excellent immersive multimedia mix of art, music, and quotes."
5,THANK GOD! I am sick of co-ops. One shop for everything food. I like plastic bags and large carbon footprints. I'm not going to martyr myself and pay more for a smaller selection for some pinko environmentalist agenda.
1,"I did not have a good experience here. Upon a late check in, my business partner was told he was checking in a day late, they were expecting him the day before. After showing his confirmation confirming he was not supposed to be there a day early, he was told they would have to check with a day manager. The day after, they took care of it but the manager made it sound like it was his fault and she was doing him a favor by taking it off of his bill. 

The bathroom looked very worn, the shower and sink leaked. If you would like heat or air, the unit does not have a thermostat so it either runs or it is off. Very noisy. I was several rooms down from the elevator but I still heard and felt the vibration somehow. 

Every morning for breakfast (which was included) by 7:30 the two trash cans were over flowing. Food was average."
5,"I've been taking my dog to Dr. Nothnagel for 4 years, and have been consistently impressed with the level of care she receives.  My dog is a relatively high-strung German shepherd, and the vet is always calm and relaxed with her, which helps the dog be calm and relaxed as well.  I have found the cost of services to be reasonable and the office staff always explains the charges if I have questions.  They have even sent prescriptions for human-equivalent medications to Walgreen's for me so that I can save money."
1,"Omg!! Wow! rude. Rude. rude. After a busy long day (which included going to the dentist) I was so excited to sit down and eat my first meal of the day (at 4pm)---I was starving!!! At a table for one, I ordered a squid salad and three rolls. I thought ""hey even I don't finish it, I'll have a few pieces for lunch tomorrow."" the waitress (older Asian lady) said ""are u going to eat all that?I'm not giving you a to go box"" I was like , are you effin kidding me?!, and replied, ""I'm sure gonna try to!"" to which she argued, ""but you are so thin!"" I thought ""so if I was bigger, it would be ok? Wtf?""! I had to assure her that I eat a lot and was very hungry. Again, wtf?!
 She said ""well why don't u just get one roll, it's eight pieces.""
 do not tell your patrons what they should orderr! Ridiculous.
 We comripmised on two rolls, which I ate all of! Thank you! AND I was hungry an hour later without leftovers! I am so disappointed and insulted."
5,"The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, ""What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?"" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I've had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. 

Good thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here's where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won't miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubby's fever is already down and he's feeling much better."
5,"I would like one of these in NY please!

Up until the day I came here I had never had a pimento cheese sandwich before. Let alone a grilled pimento cheese sandwich. So, you must excuse my inability to comment on this pimento cheese sandwich in relation to others. But,  holy fscking god, was this food good!

So good I came back the next day to get spinach rolls. Which were like spinach pie but in a crispy tortilla style roll served with some tomato based salsa. T'was fabulous!"
5,"Location, location, location.  Great place in downtown Middleton.  Close to all of the places you just need to visit, such as the Mustard Museum (yes, you need to go there), Hubbard St. Diner (try the pies or the carrot cake), and definitely go to the live band at the Capital Brewery a block away on Friday night.  Fantastic place to walk and just enjoy the ambiance of a great little town.  Oh, and free breakfast, free food and drinks on Tues-Thurs, free morning newspapers and spacious suites are all wonderful."
1,"I try to like you Postinos, I really do but you make it so hard.  Came on a Tuesday for their 8 PM $20 Bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyed.

The parking lot disaster strikes again!  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces.  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee.  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spaces.

Once seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders.  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu.  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just ""you ready to order?""

We ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.  No offer of another round of drinks, just here is your check.

The wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta.  The bruschetta themselves were half assed.  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decent.

Yet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage.  I don't understand how I am the only one who keeps having horrible experiences here?"
1,"I see nothing has changed with this store. I just watched a ups store commercial and I laughed out loud!!  Kimberly (the brunette bitch behind the counter) is still the most evil woman walking on the planet.  I have more respect for the hookers on Van Buren Street than I do for this low class, snotty, unhelpful useless piece of trash!!  Stay away from this store at all cost!!!!"
1,"Worst customer service ever. I had an issue with a rental of chairs and tables and the cashier was rude, disrespectfull and unhelpfull. The tables were dirty and breaking apart the chairs were filthy. I agree with the previous comment that the pinatas are nice and sturdy but thats about it."
5,"Probably the best yellow curry and pad Thai anywhere in the Phoenix area. The coconut ice cream was a nice, lite treat, too. Very friendly staff. When I went in, they seemed to know the regulars - which were quite a few.

One downside, seemed a little pricier than most other Thai restaurants, but worth it.

Definitely going back."
1,"Open 24 hours - only thing that rates a star; pharmacists lack customer service, time management, and efficiency skills"
5,"Since I lived in Madison (about 8 years ago) the po' boys at NOTO have haunted me!  The pursuit of a po' boy as good as this has eluded me through 4 cities and countless ""nope, not as good""s.  I'm such a fan I bought a tank top on my last visit!

Perfect bread, perfect seasonings - be it oyster, shrimp, crawfish or chicken.    Whenever I'm back in Madison (which is, unfortunately, rarely, I take friends to get a ""sandwich as big as yo head"" and they never leave disappointed.

As I remember it, NOTO is that kind of hole in the wall place that newcomers hesitate to try out.  My advice - do it!  As much as I love these sandwiches I hardly ever order them out anymore because I know they will never be as good as at New Orleans Take Out in Madison, WI."
5,"I. Like. This. Hotel. If no shuttle is available to pick you up from the airport, they pay for your cab. The front desk staff is quick and attentive which is exactly what you want after a day of air travel. Room service was very friendly and the food was YUM. The toilet handle was misbehaving and while it took some time for engineering to fix it, they were beyond apologetic and did all of the things you'd expect a good hotel to do - either offer a room change/upgrade or other free stuff. The hotel is in Middleton so don't book a room here and then complain that it's not downtown. Look at a map. How is it the hotel's fault that you are in need of additional IQ points? 

So many Yelpers like to complain about every dumb, little thing without understanding that it's not about perfection, it's about how a business responds to a problem. This Marriott is not as modern as some others, but I'd pick a clean room and good service over some spiffy wallpaper and Berber carpet any day."
5,"It is quite overwhelming watching football here on Sundays. With every game on and trying to pay attention to your fantasy team is tough.

I tried the ""Big Unit"" and I thought the hotdog, itself, tasted like it was microwaved. The Chili, for some reason I cant point out why,was the best ive ever tasted. The night before I had ribs and wings. Both really good

The bartender on Sunday was cool. I spent over $60 but the beer and food was worth it"
1,"I brought my 2005 Honda CRV in because the air conditioner was blowing warm air.  I made an appointment and dropped my car off there because it's fairly close to my sister's house which is where I wanted to wait. Thirty minutes later they called me to ask approve a $48.00 diagnostic check. No problem, I tell them.  1 hour after that they call me to tell me that my air compressor is locked up. I ask what it would cost to fix it.  I was shocked when he quoted me $2235,00 total, parts and labor. When I picked my car up the cashier told me that the compressor was $650.00. The labor is what brought it up to $2235.00. I talked to many friends who suggested I check out either Amazon or EBay for a brand new compressor then take to a local mechanic for installation. BRILLIANT! I purchased a brand new air compressor for my car for $115.00 from Amazon with free shipping. I then took that up to Angel's Auto Repair and they charged me $300.00 to install and that included the freon. I don't understand why Pep Boys charged so much but I appreciate the honesty and integrity from Angel's Auto Repair. My air is nice and cold now!"
1,"This is the worst Chinese restaurant I have ever been to.  Here is a list of problems:

1.  Too expensive for a hole in the wall.  I ordered two entrees, fried rice, egg rolls and two beverages.  The bill was $32.30
2.  The egg roll was not an egg roll, it looked like a giant size deep fried hot pocket.  
3.  I asked the waitress if we could return the egg roll because it was not what I was expecting. I didn't even have a single bite.   She told me it was already served to me so she wouldn't remove it from the bill.  It was $3.50. It's not like I was asking for some special VIP treatment or asking for my meal to be comped.
4.  To end my dinner, there was a cricket crawling on the wall behind me.  That killed my appetite.  Also the place looked like a dump.  The ceiling looked like it had water damage.  The whole place was trashy looking.  

In conclusion, the food wasn't good, customer service was horrible, and the place is a dump -both inside and out.
EFF this place!!!!"
5,Great place for great breakfasts and service. Home cooked and friendly competent staff.
5,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm usually a Burger King guy (I like their mascot better, McDonald's is too funny looking).

However, my friend was in town, and I thought, ""why the heck not? live a little!"" so I brought her here.

On our way to McDonald's, also known as ""Mickey D's"" in other areas, I begin to worry that maybe I should have called to reserve a table in advance.

However, upon arriving, we were pleasantly surprised to find no line!! 

We did wait a minute or two to be seated, but apparently, this is one of those seat yourself places.  

As I approached the front, I was immediately mesmerized by their huge selection of burgers. Their menu ranged from McSingles to McDoubles to even McTriples!! They also had a dollar menu consisting of items costing $1.07 after tax. 

I decided to go with their house special, The Big Mac, and their seasonal Chicken ""McNugget"" Pieces.

When I opened up my box of chicken nuggets, the pale-golden/yellow skin indicated that it had just came out of the storage unit next to the fryer. 
 
As the freshness evaporated with every bite, I really began to taste all the other kinds of meat that went into making the nuggets. I think I even tasted some pork, but don't take my word for it. 

Oh my God and then you have the dipping sauces! These little containers held the perfect blend of artificial sweetener and manufactured taste  

As I eagerly unwrapped my Big Mac, I was slightly disappointed to find that it wasn't as advertised (the picture on the display made it seem a lot bigger!!). Oh well.

I would really like to commend the chef on making the buns just how I like them, extremely soggy. I was even more impressed that the soggy, limp buns were able to maintain their round form. This is some pretty advanced cooking technique!!

Anyways, as I bit into my Big Mac, the first thing I tasted was the mayo. Actually, it was the only thing I tasted, but it was some damn good mayo. 

Finally, if you're watching your waistline, they have a plethora of drink options. Choices like Diet Coke, Diet Coke Zero, Sugar-free Diet Coke Zero, etc... ensures that there's a perfect diet drink for everyone. 

PS: Perfect date spot for Valentine's Day. Highly recommended!!"
5,"Okay, first of all, this place looks like it would be located in the slums of San Salvador.. sketchy area, bars on the window, almost looks lifeless from the street. ""Never judge a book by its cover"" definitely applies to this place. This place has some good and very authentic Salvadorian food. Came here and got my usual choice of salvi treats, pupusas revueltas, pastelitos, platanitos and an ice cold agua de ensalada... AMAZING!"
1,"I purchased $ 793.00 glasses on 5-3-13.  I am on the fourth set of glasses which translates into 6 trips to Nationwide Vision Center.  Six trips for one item!  How many chances do you give a professional business to deliver on one $ 800.00 item?  Ok, maybe I assumed they were a professional business.  I have a simple bifocal subscription.  When I ordered I asked for glasses without the lines on the lenses.  I also asked for glasses that worked like sunglasses outside and regular glasses indoors.  I was given a bill and I paid my portion and was told I would be called when the glasses were ready.  I called two weeks after ordering my glasses and was told the factory made an error and the glasses were sent back to the factory.  A week later I called and the glasses were ready.  When I put the glasses on everything felt a little wobbly but I was told there is an adjustment period. I was not wearing the glasses for driving so it was a couple of days before I noticed there was not a sunglass effect standing in the sun.  Disappointed I took the glasses back.  The representative tried to convince me that the lenses were exactly what I had ordered.  When I asked her to step outside in the sunlight and show me she suddenly decided that maybe all I had was the anti-glare and the lenses were not correct.  She said she would correct the glasses and call me when they were ready. One week later I was called and told the glasses were ready.  When I went in to pick them up on my lunch hour I was once again let down.  They were now trying to give me plain old glasses with the line across the lenses.  I did not want to try them on but the representative insisted.  I told her I could clearly see the line on the lenses so they could not be my glasses.  She insisted that I needed to try them on.  I told her that I want a refund and NO I am not trying the glasses on.  She said she would get her manager.  I sat there for 15 minutes waiting.  I then met with Diana the Manager.  I clearly stated that I wanted a refund.  I was patient and they had three chances to correctly produce my glasses and they could not get the job done. Diana then stated that she would personally take care of my glasses and that they would be correct.  She said she would give me a discount for the inconvenience I had been experiencing.  She looked me in the eye and gave me her word.  I looked her in the eye and replied that I was a letter writer.  If the glasses were not correct I would contact Nationwide Vision Center corporate headquarters, Facebook and any forum available to express my dissatisfaction with Nationwide Vision Center product and service.  I picked up the glasses on 6-14-13.  I met with Diana and asked if she had checked the glasses and she said yes.  She put my lenses in the glasses and I tried them on.  The glasses seemed to be ok.  Things looked a little fuzzy and the ground appeared to be moving.  I was told again that there is an adjustment time and that it would clear up soon.  We went outside and they seemed to be more shaded than my old pair of glasses.  When we went inside again I asked her if all the features I ordered were on the glasses and she said yes.  She went outside again with the glasses while I was waiting and she checked them in the sun.  Diana stated again that the glasses were what I ordered.  I was running late on my lunch hour and was feeling rushed to get back to the office. When you go in to pick up glasses you should expect it to be an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes.  Diana discounted $39.99 on the glasses.  When I got home that night and stood out in the sun for five minutes, nothing happened.  The lenses did not darken.  The lenses have a purple/rose colored hue when I am indoors and outdoors. I did not detect a change to the lenses when standing in direct sunlight.  I will return tomorrow morning and get my refund. 
I went back the next morning (6-15-13) to return the glasses.  The representative put them under a special light they had and presto the glasses got very dark.  We then went outside and the glasses were definitely darker.  I asked the customer service representative why the glasses were a purple/rose hue outside in the sun and not grey.  I ordered gray and I had expected to see grey.  He said no that is the gray (yes the Emperor has clothes).  He then added that the lenses are effected by heat and the lenses will not get as dark outside in Phoenix as they would in Flagstaff.  He repeated it again that if I go to Flagstaff the glasses would be significantly darker.  I do not live in Flagstaff, I live in Phoenix and I purchased my glasses in Phoenix and I expect them to work in Phoenix.  The glasses are still fuzzy when I try to read small print.  I have not been able to darken the lenses to the level they did in the store with their special UV light.  I left the glasses out in the direct sun for 2 hours.  This is starting to feel like a bait and switch scam."
1,"Are you kidding me???!!! Do they really call this Mexican food?!!!! WOW, cant believe its food. Only thing i liked in there was the sodas and the sopapillas, that's it. Everything else was not a pleasant taste!!!! 

I would not recommend this place what so ever!!!"
5,"A few months back we adopted a second dog from DCHS and were once again thrilled with the level of service we received. It was a several hour process because my bf went to meet the dog first, and then after he fell in love with him, I came along with our other dog to meet him. We had adopted our first dog from DCHS a little over a year prior to this and absolutely love her (and yes, spoil her). 

We thought the staff handled the introduction of the dogs flawlessly. They let each dog sniff out the room alone, and then had my bf and I watch through windows as they introduced the dogs. They kept the atmosphere positive and free from distractions, while slowly giving them more and more space to interact. The dogs were buddies from the start and have continued to be best friends. 

Once again, we were thrilled with the staff and the whole process. Also like the resale shop set up in the hall, very cool! 

Remember to support animal shelters and rescues! Buying an animal from a pet store or a breeder means denying a shelter animal a chance at life. Anyone who has ever adopted an animal will confirm that they are the best!"
1,My gay neighbor took me here for afternoon cocktails on a Sat. This place sucks! The bartender was unfriendly and the bloody mary had no alcohol. Wont return again. It also smells like cigarette smoke from before they banned smoking in the bars. Gross! better dive bars to be had
1,"Beware being ripped off at Au Petit Four!  If only i can give no star, i would.  We dined late on a Saturday night. We were the only table in the restaurant.  The desserts were good, but very expensive- (1) coffee $2.00, (2) Arrowhead water $2.00, (1) Lorina lemonade $3.50, (1) mango mousse cake, (2) Creme brûlées, (1) chocolate chip cookie, (1) white cake, all total to $48.50.  It was an indication when there were no price tags for the desserts.  The owner didn't even give us an actual bill, but just came by to tell us the total.  We were all pretty tired and didn't give too much thought of the amounts. I am extremely disappointed, SHAME ON YOU AU PETIT FOUR!"
5,"I eat there every other week if not more often.  Service has been great and one of the best club sandwichs in town.  A lot of tv's to watch the games.  Friends like the burgers, but I always stick with the club.  Surprising a decent beer selection as well."
1,"Gross, plain and simple!  I'll crave some quick Chinese Food and then I'm always upset.  What a waste of money!"
5,"Loved the food, but not the prices. Oh well! I don't remember names of the sandwiches, but we tried two different kinds and I loved them. One had turkey and cranberry sauce (they ran out of stuffing) but I didn't care! The other one had a kick to it. Peppers, chipotle sauce and roast beef. YUMMY! 

We were staying right down the street and I found this place on yelp and I'm glad we did. :-)"
1,"I have to say i'm quite saddened that i had to choose 1 star; as i was so looking forward to finding a new fav along Camelback rd. my sister and i headed to Rosie Mc Caffreys (sp), but turned off at SunUp Brewing Co. by default; we had to stop in because we were both starved and the menu offered Corned Beef and cabbage, plus we still had about 6 streets to go. 

we stepped inside to a ""please wait to be seated"" sign, so we waited, and waited (as several wait staff passed and looked our way without even a nod of acknowledgement) for about 5 minutes. finally our server approached us and offered inside or patio (we chose patio of course!) she was very nice at first seating and asked for our drink order. since neither of us partake in the appreciation for micro brews, we chose raspberry ciders. we were happy. the crowd was sparse-but present. the weather was fabulous. 

it was a weird set-up with 3 small rooms (patio in between both) and no room to turn around. there was no reason our server should have been perturbed; other than having to maneuver around tables inside, as she hardly had tables. none the less, when she returned with our beers, she plopped them down hard on the table and stormed off. the beers were served lukewarm but we tried to drink them anyways. 

she returned a few minutes later for our order. since it was a toss up between the Corned beef and cabbage & the Fish n chips, i asked the servers opinion, inquiring if the corned beef was sliced thin, of to which she replied ""it isn't sliced thin""-but it was sliced thinner than a nickel, plus the meal wasn't even served with bread or butter; but back to the ordering....

after she took our order, i asked her for 2 cold pint glasses; since the beers were warm (only the bottle was slightly cold). she brought back glasses with ice and straws, pounced them on the rod iron table and went on to tell me why micro brews aren't served in cold pint glasses, saying she didn't have any chilled pint glasses because this is a micro brewery. 

it wasn't until after her lecture on the creation of beer, that i explained that even if there is a right way to serve-some people do request chilled pints. i explained that i wasn't a beer afficionado, i just wanted to drink my beer the way it should be served ""chilled"" she gave me attitude, walked away and then returned with two cold pint glasses, pouncing them on the table as she uttered ""here these are for our Root Beer"" while she turned on her heels to run. 

the rest of the meal was pleasant, as she was hardly available. the only time i seen any of the female servers was when an assumingly wealthy man was spotted, that was when most of the servers would approach and hug them (much to close by restaurant standards) very tightly. however most tables around us were either taken by lesbians or hetero females so the ladies weren't hoovering around us too much.  

we received the credit card bill to sign, which was also plopped off mid walkaway. the tables are patio tables with holes, so most people with common sense would prepare for the signing of the bill with a hard bottom of some sort, but not here! they are all consumed with the spotting of rich men and instructions for micro brewing that they don't have time to serve or be of assistance, so be prepared to either pay them upfront to be treated like a patron, or flash your directors card because they seem to think this is suddenly Scottsdale. 

on to the food. i tasted my sisters fish and chips and the homemade chips were soggy from the fish. the halibut was delicious although sister had to pull off all the breading, because it was as thick as an Indian popover. they did serve it with spicy ketchup which was surprisingly delicious. my corned beef cabbage was served paper thin, without bread or butter; but it was still very tasty. the red potatoes soft and the carrots & cabbage blanched to perfection. next time i'll just try sitting at the bar."
1,"My two friends and I went for lunch today and the service was really bad. There were several tables loaded with dirty dishes around us, which, when we left an hour it so later, were still the same way. It took so long to get our food that I did not order a second portion for fear that we would have 
to wait too long.

The food, when we finally got it, was tepid soup and a spinach salad without much dressing but trying to send it back was not an option. It looked as if they were short on staff and very short on supervision. 

I will not be going back for some time. This experience was very frustrating."
5,"I happened upon this charming restaurant and loved the simple and warm feel of the place. I had visions of an egg breakfast but it was too late in the day, so the wait person suggested the quiche which did not disappoint.  I was on the road so stopping at the Prairie Cafe was just the right thing to do."
5,"Oh man, the most amazing mexican grocery store! The produce is cheap and incredibly fresh. Also the corn tortillas were fresh made and warm when we bought them, and delicious at dinner that night! (warning though, do refrigerate them because they go stale fast!) We had lunch there too, the tacos were fabulous. The meats are great, and they have a bar for toppings."
1,Check in staff was great the view from out side was ok. Then the room electrical switches that are barely sticking out some you can see wires on. Paint was peeling all over and the shower was falling apart the caulking was all coming off. These rooms are not what I expect for this price. Even the tv which was a older flat screen did not have HD and half the channels failed to work. Breakfast was not great and  they failed to clean up tables so no where to sit and eat. Pool area had several areas trapped off as well as the parking lot had a lot of it closed. Over all very disappointed in this property I would not recommend it. When I checked out I was told your good to go as she ate her breakfast and then walked away not once was I asked how my stay was.
1,"I thought I would try out this location, big mistake. First parking is a nightmare. Second, I sat inside first and went unnoticed for 10 minutes. Then a fight broke out so I moved to the outside bar where there was no bartender. Twenty minutes in I was getting up to leave when waitress finally asked if I wanted a beer, a 3 dollar pbr wasn't bad so I figured why not. I felt completely ignored for 30 minutes,  will never come back. I'm halfway through my pbr and can't wait finish it so I can leave."
5,"My 8 year old daughter and I stayed at the B&B this past weekend.  We stayed in the Sorenson room which was the right size for us.  It had an attached, good sized bathroom which was great, and my daughter loved that she got to take a bath in a tub that was over 100 years old.  (The water pressure is great by the way).  There was an assortment of soaps, shampoos, bubble baths etc in the bathroom too.  The room and bathroom were clean and spotless.  Craig was extremely nice, helpful, and whipped up a killer breakfast.... a brown sugary, apple, cranberry, upside down baked french toast kind of concoction, homemade pumpkin bread, fresh watermelon, and sausage links.  He was very accomodating and asked us the night before if there were any allergies or food issues that he needed to know about.  The price was very affordable, and the next time I'm in the area I'll be staying there instead of a hotel.  : )"
1,when you walk in its old school which is cool and the outside is cool but the food was medioca just a bit i would not give the a second shot now a different location maybe...
1,"I am being utterly polite by giving this place one star. Places where I've had better food: the cafeteria in a hospital, 7-11, if I'd ever been to prison, prison. I'm not sure if Jordan's pays people to park in its lot to give the impression that the place is full. There's absolutely nothing authentically Mexican about this place, except, perhaps, for the Mexican dishwasher.  If you've recently lost your tase buds, love greasy beef dumped into a Old El Paso ""taco shell"" topped with shredded Velveeta and iceberg lettuce, then, boy is this the place for you. Also, if you're a fan of tomato paste in the guise of ""salsa"" and served from a stolen syrup container from IHOP, then do it up at Jordan's.

Please, do yourself (and your wallet) a favor and eat at the Jack-in-the Box down the street. You've been warned."
5,"Holy cow! 

I just had a haircut and a shave, and the experience was awesome! The cut was very good ( as always), but the shave was incredible! It took about 45 minutes, and was as ""full service"" as you can get (straight razor, hot towels, clay mask, cold towels, shoulder massage after). 

You owe it to yourself to give it a shot, guys!"
5,"I love stopping at Cool Beans for a quick work-day lunch! It's one of my favorite places to bring a friend when we're meeting up during the work week.

Their food is great and made fresh - I've never had a bad dish here, but my favorite is the grilled vegetable sandwich with the side salad. I am also a big fan of their coffee drinks. Hazelnut lattes are my go-to.

Great little cafe!!!"
5,"Disney Land for Foodies. Fresh Baked Goods, Salsas, Mexican dishes (the torta cubana is to die for) and an awesome atmosphere, plus more produce than the human eye should ever behold. My favorite place in Phoenix."
1,"I have been going to this IHOP every month for 4 years. Our group is anywhere from 8 to 25. There are only two places in the restaurant that accommodate groups and for the most part, we have been seated relatively quickly. Over the past year, service has gone down hill. It started taking forever to get our order taken, get our drinks, or get our food. We are a very forgiving bunch and know it's not easy to serve a large group but as service started really sliding, our last trip ended the relationship. We had about 20 people and knew we would have to wait a bit, but after 30 minutes, we inquired how long and it was like ""your waiting for a table?""the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups. How can you not remember a group when they take up the whole lobby? We called a near by breakfast place and they were thrilled to have our party, which grew smaller since some left at that point. We found a new home and they will get 5 stars on my review."
1,"There donuts are good but the nastiest coffee ever!! I threw up!! I ordered an iced coffee. THe girl ask if I wanted flavor and milk I said sure thinking I was going to put in my own milk and get a regular shot of flavor, but all I got was iced milk that was super sweet I don't even think there was coffee in it. I don't drink milk the only time I ever use it is in coffee. Learn how to make drinks $2.50 for undrinkable coffee I am super pissed I guess I should of drank some before I left. This was the 7th street location boo boo boo boo"
5,"We've been taking our dog to Dr. Miller at Monona Vet Clinic since we first got him 7 years ago. We've always had positive experiences. Everyone is professional, knowledgeable, and caring."
1,"Service was slow. Waiter knew little about what they served. They didn't even offer sangria. My meat on my enchilada wad tough and flavorless. It's hard to do Mexican this bad, but they pulled it off."
1,"I wish I could give it 0 stars. This place is overrated at its best. The food is GROSS and Bland. 

Pizza, gross.

cheese bread, gross.

pesto pasta bread bowl, gross.

wings, gross.

staff, awful."
5,"These guys always do a thorough job. My rig looks good every time. Really great value in a car wash.  Been there with my old VW van, and with my late model Touraeg and they give equal attention to both."
5,"Get up, go downtown and eat here!"
5,"Omg Great, I had the shrimp ench. with Chz Relleno.  Excellent"
5,"Lovely beautiful stunning gardens.  I am a fan of all things botanical, and have been wanting to visit this place for some time.  Doesn't disappoint, especially because it's free to walk the grounds.  Parking was easy, I did not mind paying to walk in the conservatory either.  The structure and layout of the grounds is quite magica."
1,"This review is not for the food.. I LOVE the food..this review is for the service I received today and your ridiculous policy for takeout orders which doesnt accomodate the working class.

Today I called in at 11am to place a ""togo"" order and was informed that the next available ""pick up"" time was 12:45pm. WTF? Umm when did you start taking take out orders in increments? Whose brilliant idea was this? It seems that Oreganos must have had a meeting.. ""How Can We Throw Money Out The Window"".. I know! By not allowing people to call in and place take out orders to be picked up within 30-40 minutes! That person needs to be fired. seriously, you lost a $100 order this morning..who knows how many more you lost today or will continue to lose with this kind of  business practice. This would have been repeat business no less. I guess we'll take our repeat lunch business elsewhere and make sure we get the word out to all companies that enjoy ordering from Oregano's that you can't accommodate multiple togo orders at lunch time during the week M-F. You can't be oblivious to how many other restaurants can and will gladly accommodate? Can You? Good Luck to you."
5,"CHILAQUILES! CHILAQUILES! CHILAQUILES!

They are like a punch in the gut that you will ask for over and over again.  Also, the little sammiches at the bakery counter.  With a slice of ham, a little bit of melted cheese, and a roasted pepper - on a sesame bun.  Worth ever literal penny you will pay for them."
5,We ate everything. Great food and don't let the skull painting outside scare you. It's supposed to only scare gringos.
5,"I really love Cheuvront's.  I think it's really underrated.    I've never had a bad food, beverage or service experience, and I've been many, many times.

One of the things I love to do at Cheuvront's is the tastings.   Wine tastings, cheese classes, beer tastings... it's all yummy, PLUS super-fun, and very informative too.

Cheuvronts has been through a couple of different chefs, but the food is always consistently made from ultra fresh, premium ingredients.  My favorites include just about any salad on the menu, and the salmon, mmmm.    

The cheese selection is, bar none, the best in Phoenix metro.   I didn't say it was the cheapest; but it is definitely the best selection of some of the most fantastic cheeses I've ever had. 

I highly recommend going to a cheese class to learn more about cheeses!   Ken Cheuvront is extremely knowledgeable and has travelled to most of the places where the cheese is made and has personally met most of the cheese makers.   So that makes for some great stories which make you appreciate the cheese even more.

There are great happy hour deals on both food (starters) and beverages, and on Sundays and Mondays the happy hour prices go ALL DAY.   Unbelievable deal! 

(Btw:  I don't understand what this means from other reviews: ""it wants to be more hip than it really is""?  Huh?   I think the decor is great - cool, breezy, comfortable.   Is it hip?  I dunno.   And I sure don't know what ""trying to be hip"" looks like.)   It does have ""unisex"" bathrooms, which, personally I don't care for... since that means they smell like a men's room... but I'm told my nose is hypersensitive.  : )"
1,"Horrible, horrible service.  I went twice before writing a review.  the first time I thought maybe it was an off day.  The second time, they lost me as a customer.  The wait staff was more interested in talking about their weekend plans than serving customers.  The food was okay, nothing special.  But, for the price, I expect a little more service from a staff that realizes they're not working at Denny's.  Hell, Denny's usually has pretty solid service.  This place will have to go to an extreme to get me to return.  If I could give them zero stars, I would."
1,"This is a tough one. This restaurant is a lot of fun, has reasonable prices and very good food. 

Unfortunatley you can expect a wait of 1-2 hours seemingly anytime during the week, night or day. Even take-out usually takes over an hour!

I suppose that's evidence of the restaurant's overall quality, but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad, because they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted."
1,Why would anyone pay money for food like this?
5,"here's the word from a trusted friend who recently went:
very
latin
it was yummy and fun
awesome music
fun dancing
good crowd
on a scale of 1-10?

1,"Went to the movie early Saturday evening, but ate beforehand. I wish I had waited to eat at the theatre concession stand. I know I would have gotten tastier food for the money. I ordered the Carne Asada...it was bland  and as tough as shoe leather. I told the waitress and she said, ""oh, ok"". I foolishly expected a manager to approach the table, but that didn't happen. When she brought the bill, I had been charged $14, essentially for rice and refried beans because the carne asada was barely touched. I also drank 2 margaritas during their happy hour...didn't even catch a buzz and I am a lightweight when it comes to alcohol. I did get heartburn, though. My first trip to this place will be my last! Why didn't I check Yelp first????"
5,"The clinic itself is very, very nice. They had Frozen playing and just about any good magazine you'd want to read in the waiting room. Everyone was very friendly and went out of their ways to make sure I was comfortable at all times. 

Dr. Brent could have easily said I need a few new fillings--how am I to know? That makes me feel like they're serious about their work and not in it for the money. I know a few people who have been told they need work done when they didn't. I trust that the Killians don't do that. Dr. Brent also seemed to know his stuff. 

I don't even like the dentist and I'm looking forward to going back!"
1,"""If I could rate this place 0 stars I would""
I have been to the Long Wongs in Tempe, so my boyfriend and I thought of stopping by here, we wanted to watch the championship game and we needed a place quick. We go in wanting some drinks, well the bar was closed...fine, we went and sat at a table a couple feet from a tv, perfect! We asked what draft beers they had and she said they had Bud Light, Coors Light, and Budweiser, so my boyfriend ordered a coors and i got vodka cranberry, she brought over a bottle of coors light and I walked over to the bar and looked at their tap handles and they also had Shocktop and Sierra Nevada on tap as well. Servers clearly do not know what they even have here.
After waiting for about 30 minutes for our appetizer, we finally got it and then 10 minutes later we got our two burgers.
We had no napkins and when we were looking for our server who seemed to be non-existent all night we saw her talking with the manager behind a wall, after staring at them for a few minutes he finally noticed and sent her to come check on us for the first time the whole meal.
Over all just awful service, our server did not know about food or drinks and on top of it could barely communicate with us. 

We were there to watch a game along with two other tables of five guys each who were clearly watching the championship and cheering loudly. After about 15 minutes while trying to figure out why I could barely hear the game I realized they had TV on a news channel right behind the counter, and the server & manager were also playing music from a jukebox on the other side of the restaurant in the ""closed"" bar so loudly I couldn't make out any distinct audio and once we asked why there was music playing she replied ""oh we're listening to music.""

My boyfriend and I both have been working in the industry for years and we are completely understandable of a busy restaurant and things taking a few minutes. There were TWO other tables in there and our server was seen 2 times, our food took forever, and the burgers were not worth it at all. We finally got the check and payed and left, we wrote a small note about how the service was awful (we wanted to talk to the manager but he was too busy trying to get it in clearly) and this is where it gets so much better. We left and saw him walk outside, but we were already on the main street so we called and told him about the situation, he asked us ""Yes, was there a problem?"" We told him about everything, the service, her not being knowledgable of any of her surroundings or her menu, and he replied ""oh...okay"" 

This place is a disaster, they clearly need to make some decisions to get this place turned around or need a complete new management staff, they lost potential regulars and I will tell every single person I can how awful of an experience I had.

DO NOT GO HERE!!!"
1,"Have been going to LGO since 2003 and have always enjoyed the cuisine. Several times - either when ordering in the grocery or dining at the Pizzeria - the music has been so headsplitting as to wipe out any ambience or semblance of a welcoming neighborhood restaurant. Last night the demographic in the Pizzeria during the course of our meal ranged from 30-80 years of age. Several pleas to turn the music down just enough to be able to hear the waiter standing next to me were greeted with ""it's just how we do things"" and ""there's no point in asking because they won't turn it down even a little"". The waiter, David, said many servers consistently relay complaints but that the owner ""really doesn't care"". Hubris is so unappetizing. I think the food is great but, because I have no desire to support a business that really doesn't give a crap about its clientele, I'll spend my money lavishly elsewhere."
5,"What a bonus Ohlbrich is... free and beautiful. Watch tha flowers bloom in the spring, in summer see the birds swooping in the twilight, in fall the colors are amazing and in winter the sun dazzles with the frosty foliage. 
Hey, take your kids for a walk, steal a kiss from your lover, or bring a book and relax. This city treasure is in walking distance for me and is easily accessible by bus and bike (right on the bike path). Go, you won't be sorry."
5,"Although a little pricier than I'd prefer, I'm giving Welcome Diner 5 stars for the delicious locally-produced food, relaxed and friendly atmosphere, and the outgoing people who work there.
You know a restaurant has something good going when a college student is willing to pay $10 for a watermelon salad. Or $5 for french fries with an egg on top (seriously, you have to try it. So delicious.)
Welcome Diner has a unique operation--in the warm Arizona months, Welcome Diner operates from 5pm to midnight, and during the cool Arizona months, it's open for brunch and lunch. Whenever you happen to visit, you'll be greeted warmly, offered delicious food, and given a wonderful starry opportunity to enjoy the night (or morning) with dear friends."
5,"Awesomest mexican grocery store ever! This place is huge, clean, well kept, stocked with all sorts of awesome products, super low prices, and the friendliest people. I hate getting in the car for anything, and Phoenix Ranch Market is worth the 30 mile drive. I knew I was in for a treat just after getting out of the car - mexican party music piped into the parking lot & super bright displays visible through the doors. My boyfriend & I went up and down every aisle grabbing fun products to make awesome meals at home - masa, cast iron tortilla press, various mexican cheeses like asadero & oaxaca, fresh chips, fresh butter tortillas, real sugar pepsi & coke bottles, dried chillies, dried herbs (mexican oregano & cinnamon), nectars & coconut water to use as margarita mixers, etc. There is an entire cheese deli devoted to various kinds of cotija cheese (there had to be at least 10 different kinds). You can buy every kind of fresh tortilla your mind can think of, even whole wheat. There is a fresh fruit & salsa bar where you can buy stuff priced insanely low by the pound ($1.50/pound of fresh fruit?unreal!). There is an agua fruit bar with 10 different kinds - the coconut is to die for (and makes awesome margaritas!). 

I love this place."
1,"I am confused about all the hype. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza (which was on special for 11.99) and 20 wings. My order came out to $34.00.

Holy shit! $1.10 per wing? Are you serious? ""Better be some damn good wings"", I thought to myself..

Homie on the phone said my delivery would take 30-45 minutes. Ya.. No. Add an hour to that. 

Pizza and wings finally arrived, and I was fucking starving.. Honestly.. the pizza was bad. I want chewy crust, flavorful sauce, and stretchy cheese. Pizza Heaven offers none of these mandatory pizza components..

The wings were soggy on the outside, and over cooked on the inside. The meat was tough, and stringy.

What a waste of time, and money. Don't be fooled by some of the reviews on here.. What I experienced was nothing short of Pizza Hell-"
5,"Love this tiny spot! Fits all my Mexican food needs: good salsa, good chips/tortillas, good beans. Truly delicious homestyle Mexican. Add onto that great and quick service plus super cheap prices... Oh and their iced tea with a hint of cinnamon is my favorite kind. El Bravo serves a similar style.

These kind of restaurants are why I'm happy to be a Phoenician."
1,"This buffest reminded me of a Las Vegas buffet except all the food gave me heartburn.  I'd been to a hometown buffet before so when my bf suggested it I relied on my memory of the experience and agreed to go.  Unfortunately my memory must have been jilted by the occasion or this Hometown Buffet was just bad, I dont know.  what I do know is that the food is cheap, about 10$ per person.  It is also soft.  And by this i mean everything is overcooked.  And it all gave me heartburn that lasted all day.  So will I be back?  Maybe in about 10 years when I've forgotten about this experience."
5,Fave date spot.  Food is always great.  Love the wine and cheese selection.
5,"A recurring theme of my childhood was ""DON'T TOUCH THAT!""  ""PUT THAT DOWN RIGHT NOW"" and ""SO HELP ME, I WILL RIP OFF YOUR LITTLE ARMS AND LEGS"".  Ok, that last one might not be totally related, but clearly, I'm scarred.  For some reason as soon as you tell me not to touch something, I'm all ""TOUCHY TOUCHY TOUCHY!""  and that does not work in most museums!  They get really pissy if you reach for the Mona Lisa.  

So the Arizona Science Center is PERFECT for those who share my tactile proclivities.  YOU CAN TOUCH EVERYTHING! For those who are germ phobic, plenty of hand sanitizing stations to keep you clean.

We spent about 4 hours, you could go longer with older children, but if you have toddlers that might be your max.  You can leave and come back with the wristband, in spring or fall it would be perfect to go in the AM, have a picnic, and then come back for additional visits.

The Planetarium and the IMAX, as well special exhibits like the Star Trek the Exhibition.  We paid extra for the IMAX and Star Trek, but decided we didn't have time for the Planetarium.  That is on my must go back for list.   The Star Trek exhibit was good - but I'm a geek, so I wouldn't recommend it for a non-Trekkie.  I thought it was well worth it.  The IMAX was also great - my mom loved it since it was about Santorini, Greece, and she's been there.  

But the highlight for me were the hands on exhibits.  All of them were great - and I actually learned some stuff!  I could go on and on about each of them, but I really think if you like cool stuff, touching things (THINGS, NOT PEOPLE) and have a sense of adventure and wonder, you would really enjoy a day here.

Note:  Until April 2010 you can get up to 4 free admissions with the Culture Pass, I think those are only good for the general admission, I doubt it includes the special parts, but still a great deal!"
1,"If there was ever a prime candidate for the public ax in these lean times it would be this library.  It really offers nothing more than some air conditioning, a couple of 1990's era Sports Illustrated's, and some half empty book shelves.  My illiterate nephew has a bigger book collection than this place.  The middle of the Sonoran desert has more electrical outlets and workstations than this ""library"".  
I'm sorry.  I love libraries and books and all but I just don't see much learning coming out of this place.  There are some great alternatives in the area (Burton Barr and Scottsdale)."
5,"The service is excellent, the atmosphere a time capsule of a 50s diner & the food is some of the best diner fair I've ever had. 

The Meatloaf is called the ""Meatloaf of the Gods,"" and it truly is. I don't even like Meatloaf and I literally savored each bite of this culinary masterpiece. It is extremely filling because it is made with nutrient rich local meat, savory vegetables & topped with the best gravy I've ever tasted. Yum!  For $10, how can't it be ""As good as it gets?""

If you like pie, also make sure to get a slice. It is delicious!"
5,Courtesy Auto is THE only place you should take your VW.  They do outstanding work and are super honest.  I have used them exclusively for almost 80k miles worth of service and couldn't be happier.  They know these cars in and out and won't sell you something you don't need.  Once I asked Dave if I needed front brakes and he said - I am betting your light will come on close to your next service so you probably have 7500 miles left on them.  The light came on at 7800 miles.  If you want to support a great shop - head over to Courtesy Auto.
5,Great service! Friendly people and I absolutely LOVED my nail design. I am definitely coming back! Jimmychu and Dil did my nails and I would recommend them to anyone!
1,"I am sad that this is the only baking superstore in my vicinity. Perhaps if this store were located among the many craft and culinary boutiques in the heart of Stepford (aka the East Valley), it would not be so highly rated and flocked to in throngs. I've only attempted to shop here thrice but each time I have been unable to find any of the things I had been looking for. I felt snubbed by the baking ladies who'd rather cackle amongst themselves about whose cardiologist was potentially worse than help a customer find a product. Instead I blindly searched and was waved off to an area where the items ""might be"" and when happening upon an ""out of stock"" label on a lonely shelf, was offered no further assistance on how I might acquire said missing item in the future. I left the bakery as I had come in, without a greeting and without notice. It's a shame this place blows so badly because it does smell amazing!"
5,"I've never been even remotely let down by Monty's.  Is it busy a lot?  Yes.  Are you probably going to have to wait 30 minutes to sit down?  Yes.  Is the service slow because it's so busy?  Yes.  I've never been under the impression that the service is slow because they're incompetent, but just because they're busy.  Besides that, I've never noticed it being *especially* slow... just kind of slow, which doesn't really bother me.

Let me take a moment here to recommend the Meatloaf Sandwich: Get it served cold.  Just trust me here.  Do not get it hot.  I've had it served both ways: Cold, it is a sandwich so delicious that fireworks go off in your head; Warm, it is an open-faced abomination with gravy and mashed potatoes poured all over it.

Their cheeseburger was surprisingly good (I'd even go so far to say that it's one of the best burgers I've had in Madison).  They had a special entree one evening, ""Cheeseburger Mac & Cheese,"" which was out of this world.  It really tasted like a cheeseburger over noodles!  They serve a great chef salad, have awesome spicy waffle fries, and I would die 100 times over for the buttermilk biscuits they serve with breakfast.  Their expansive dessert case is as tasty as it is impressive looking.

I was beyond sold on this place one time when I ordered a piece of german chocolate cake for dessert.  It wasn't a piece so much as it was a towering slab.  It was so tall, in fact, that it wasn't until I'd eaten enough of it that I noticed that the waiter (who was wearing a mohawk and kilt) had written, ""Das ist Deutsch"" in chocolate on the plate.  

I've had questionable service twice: Once was when I reserved a pie for a dinner I was going to and they did not have it when I got there, but tried to placate me by selling me a larger, more expensive pie.  That was after I approached the counter and saw several staff members stare at me for 20 minutes before I was finally helped.  The other time was when I was there for coffee and dessert with friends, and we paid with a card.  The waiter told us, upon picking up the card, ""You know, if you can, you should really give me my tip in cash.  We don't see it on our paychecks for another 2 weeks otherwise.""  Um...thanks for the advice on how we should tip you.  How about we don't tip you at all?

But those two experiences aside, nothing has been able to lessen my love of Monty's and all its glory."
5,"OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY. 

Darlene is the owner and #1 World Champion Queen of the Alteration Universe. I really cannot say enough good things about her. Her friendliness, dedication, and skill are unmatched. 

I started taking my dress pants here to be taken up almost 8 years ago when I was still in school at Ye Olde UW. At the time, it seemed a pretty far way to go for an alteration place (ALL the way on the east side LOL). But after the first experience, I would never go anywhere else. 

I took my wedding dress here for alterations too. As expected, a fantastic job. Now that I live 3 states away, I still bring stuff with me when I visit and have her ship it back to me! Yes, this place is THAT good. Friendly, prompt service, and very reasonable prices. 

Darlene and her staff (one other person who I've never met but must be equally as amazing), are just the BOMB plain and simple. Never had a problem with anything done here. Back in the day Alterred States was just a teensy little store in a strip mall on Northport. Now, she's taken over the big middle part! Just goes to show I'm not the only (extremely fanatic) satisfied customer! 

Best spot ever. Take your stuff here. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Really informative Native American museum.

There's plenty of free parking here which was useful as we had a rental, but I did notice that there's a metro stop right outside which should make this a very accessible location.

It was average price-wise for museums these days so I don't knock it for that. When you fully explore every part of the museum I felt it was worthwhile.

I don't profess to be an expert on Native American history (save Geronimo) so if your knowledge is a bit lacking in this area then this is the place to help fill in the gaps. It was definitely a lot of learning for one day but enjoyable and eye-opening at the same time.

The mock school area of how native americans were forced to integrate was probably the most fascinating part for me. As much as the fact that it was only a few decades ago that the school closed. You usually think of this in the Wild West over a hundred years ago.

It's a good half day to explore the museum at a fair clip and probably a full one if you stopped to inspect and read every exhibit.

Very enjoyable."
5,"If you are into being hip, head to Mickey's. This is a bar for men and women who work for a living (not that type of work social workers and academics do, but they are just as welcome). The bartenders are great (and often includes an owner). The beer taps have a nice selection, the price is lower than the more trendy bars of the area. It is an old school Wisconsin bar with a lot of charm, but little pretension."
1,"This place is disgusting. My husband and I were in town for a couple days to go to a few spring training games. We thought staying at a Days Inn would be a cheaper but still comfortable stay. Wow were we wrong.  If the strip club across the street, the homeless out front and the run down exterior were the only things wrong, we could probably still make it work. But when we got into the room, it tipped the scale. 

The room is outdated, but whatever. It was the comforter with the giant blood stain on one side and a huge hole cut into the other side that really freaked me out. The bathroom was gross with rust stains throughout the shower. The towels and washcloths were gray and stained. The sheets, when I got the courage to pull back the comforter, were stained and gray as well. No way was I ever putting my head near them. The mini fridge was covered with tape adhesive from the duct tape used to transport it. And the walls were splattered with some substance and had marks and chunks of drywall missing. Just dirty!!!

We were in the room only long enough to call other hotels to make arrangements. I couldn't even sit down in this room. 

Then the whole ordeal with the motel Manager and Priceline...I won't go into it too much but they told us we would only get one night refunded because we didn't like the fact that it was a smoking room. My husband smokes, so I have no idea what the heck kinda of story they made up. Whatever.

Please do yourself a favor and don't stay here. Not only do they misrepresent the Days Inn brand, it's probably a health hazard - you'll need a tetanus shot which is a whole lot more planning than this crappy motel deserves."
5,"1st off, Breakfast all day 24/7. Who doesn't love that!
2nd, The pies selection is fantastic. I found out that they come from the Market Street bakery in Sun Prairie. Hats off to them!!!!! 
Burgers and dinner menu- Great home cooking! fresh well made food that gives mom's at home cooking a run for it's money! 
""If you are hungry for a great filling meal, just head to Monty's"" is my new Motto. 

Love the huge parking lot! Easy in and out every time (if you can find a spot due to me being not the only other person loving this joint)
Wish they had later hours. They are only open to 10pm, which I'm kind of confused with considering they are directly across from the Barrymore theater. 
But...I still have a solid 5 stars for this new love of my life."
5,"If you want true Mexican food at a very reasonable price, and your plate not just full, but spilling over with spicy delights, this is THE place! I will definitely come back here!"
1,"Well it's been 3 years since I last reviewed this Walmart.  Here we are now in 2014 and they've torn down the old, tiny Walmart building and erected a gigantor super Walmart just behind where the old one sat.  I'd like to dance and prance through fields of flowers and sing the praises of this new ""super"" Walmart, but I can't.  

Have you ever been to a ghost town?  Have you ever been to a ghost store?  *Cue the creepy music*

This super Walmart has all the usual stylings you find at most super Walmarts.  You know what else it has in common with other super Walmarts?  A skeleton crew.  

There are 4 cashiers,manning the 20 check out lanes, and two customer service peeps behind the counter.  All the other employees are stretched as thin as possible to cover the rest of the store.  I'm in sporting goods, I need a fishing license.  Nope.  You will have to walk all the way back to customer service and request help.  They will then call for help in the sporting goods section over the PA.  Next step:  enter the grumpy, overworked employee.  This is the standard MO for all departments.  If you can't help yourself, you will be going on a hunt for the elusive, poorly treated employee.   

This is not unusual for Wally world these days.  Many locations run on a skeleton crew, so the bazillionaire Waltons can save a buck."
5,"Hands down the best Chinese food in Madison. The chicken chow mein has been a favorite since I was a child. Try the egg rolls and the jasmine or chrysanthemum tea. You really can never go wrong here! The decor is beautiful, and makes you almost feel like you could be in a restaurant in China."
5,"A real gem!  I don't get to Madison often but I am sure that if the next trip is near a meal time I know where I'll stop, Smoky Jon's. Recently our party of three each had a different entree, one that the host suggested after learning we were newby's. He guaranteed that we would love our choices and we all did.

The BBQ pork sandwich was generous, the pork was extremely tender, cooked just right (not dried out or raw) had a smokey tang that makes it so special. The ribs were cooked to perfection and tender meat nearly fell off each bone.Their sauce is mild and OK but I was surprised by the limited choices in that area.

They offer several sides and the ones we sampled were all above par. The place is adorned with ""Best Of"" plaques and I can see why."
5,"In the land where many of the Thai restaurants simply rotate proteins, carbs and a standard vegetable medley, Wild Thaiger dishes out more authentic versions of traditional Thai specialties.  I'm a huge fan, especially given that it's proof in and of itself that Thai food is more than just a combo plate - it's an explosion of flavors amalgamated into unique and colorful profiles and textures.  It's an adventure.

Wild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.

If you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.  But for my money, I'd rather blow my tastebuds out of the park with a mindful chef who prepares her curries and sauces with finesse and grace.  Yum to the freakin' yum."

travel 180 miles just to get them no one else compares yet..."
5,yum yum yum burger.... enough said!
5,"Best meat in Madison. How do I know this? Have you ever had a Bou burger? If yes, then you know. If no, then go to the Caribou on Johnson."
1,"I hadn't eaten here in 8 years or more (since my days of bar closing~), but I decided to again, on a Monday night @ 9:30 pm.  Just AWFUL.  Waited more than 30 minutes for our food, then my salad came out WITH our dinners.  Chicken friend steak ok, but smothered in bad gravy...mashed potatoes might have been okay, but also ruined with a lot of BAD gravy.  The corn was crunchy-mushy.  I chose the fish & chips, which I feel should only be advertised with big window paint, if it's edible, I literally couldn't eat it...but the fries weren't bad.  The waitress said sorry for the wait, only one cook & he was slammed, but we were terribly disappointed.  I can't believe this place is still open, with so many good resturants holding on & stil more, popping up."
1,"I actually want to get this place zero stars but that is not an option. I went here with my family my aunt and uncle words are from out-of-town and I had suggested this place because I have had the food there before and it was very good. We got to the restaurant at a decent time on a Monday night there was three other tables, we asked to down in one of the empty booths but she told us that we could not. That we had to wait. . We looked around and couldn't figure out why it was a 25 minute wait. We said okay we would like to sit down the bar and have a drink my uncle and aunt enjoy a nice glass of wine. The waitress who was very rude, told us that if we sat down at the bar to have a glass of wine that we cannot sit at a table. We looked to her completely confused she said that we could not dirty two areas of the restaurant. I couldn't believe what I was hearing! We said okay and could we sit at a table, that we will stay at for dinner,  we will understand if they couldn't get to us for the 25 minutes we can still sit and have a drink, she said no we have to stand there or sit on the bench waiting for a table for the 25 minutes or we cannot eat there!!!!  We left the restaurant and I will never return. I have now read the reviews how the service has sank. It's sad because it was a very enjoyable place at one time. Big fat F for this place."
1,"The only reason I would give this place a 1 star rating is due to their amazing soda and float selection. The food was absolutely disgusting. I never complain about food and I've definitely never sent food back, until tonight. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and was shocked to see that fries aren't even offered as a side. I took one bite of the burger and found bone fragments in the frozen beef. My sister also sent back her bean/veggie burger. It looked equally disgusting. It will take a lot of convincing to get me to go back."
1,"Dopes!  I have been there a dozen times with my X5 and yesterday, after waiting 20 minutes, they say ""your tires are too wide""  So I'm like you just did the car two weeks ago... no response just looked at me like a deer in headlights.  stupid is as stupid does i guess."
1,"I don't understand why this place is popular.  The food was bad and the service was bad.  I ordered a burger medium well and got it medium rare.  After sending it back and getting another it was still medium/medium rare but I was too hungry to send it back again and lost all faith in their cooks.  I think they served it on the same plate with the same cold fries as before.  My friend ordered a breakfast dish and it was terrible.  The scrambled eggs were so overcooked they were hard and rubbery, the potatoes were very undercooked, and the biscuit was dry and literally had no flavor.  None.  The service seriously lacked as well.  No one was unfriendly, just incompetent.

We thought the dessert would redeem them but after paying so much for a single slice of cheesecake we couldn't even finish it.  One slice was dried out and the other cheesecake had too much sour cream - it was actually mushy and very sour, almost spoiled tasting.

Bottom line, I found this place to be mediocre at best, and that's being generous. There's tons of better restaurants in the area and in the city.  Never going back, and I think the food has made me ill."
5,"I am so glad I decided to take a chance on this little place. Great food at a fair price. And, great service to boot. I had their chicken and cheddar biscuit called the Little Birdy and was in heaven. The chicken was moist with great flavor, not greasy, and not doughy. The biscuit it was on was perfection. Crispy and fluffy where it needed to be with a well balanced butteryness. To make things even better the biscuit did not fall apart after the first bite :). Loved the relaxed atmosphere and music selection outside. The dudes that were working were very courteous and answered questions without eye rolling like you may get at other downtown establishments."
5,They have the best Ebike prices in town. They are local and can fix and repair any problem. I bought 2 from them and they were very good.
1,"Absolutely unbelievable. After carving out my whole morning and changing plans around to accommodate their 4 hour window, the service man that came to my house left after about ten minutes because he was scared of my dog. Who I had already locked up per his request! It was a complete and total waste of my time. Not to mention the ignorance of this ""small business"" because apparently the fact that my dog is a pit was the real problem. Which the idiot didn't even know till I told him! If I had said boxer would you have left my house?! Horrible company."
5,"Geez, I love love love this place. Love the hurricanes, the pulled pork, the fried chicken, the biscuits, the burgers, the gravy, the 'dining in a trailer park' atmosphere.

The only thing I don't like is that rave reviews are going to make it impossible for us to stroll in on a Saturday night and get a seat at the counter. But they deserve them."
1,"If I could give this place negative stars, I would.  

This place sucked.  All-around.  The only positive note I have is they had the most recent US Weekly.  Let me start from the beginning...

I went here b/c I was driving home from work and decided that it had been at least 5 days since my last pedicure, my co-workers were extra bitchy today and I deserved 25 minutes of pampering.  So I stopped when I saw the first nail salon.  This strategy works 9/10, so don't fault me for that, trust me, it works.

I walk in and they get me in right away.  I pick my color and sit down.  No massaging chair, no magazines (I had to ask for one) and nowhere to put my purse.  Whatever.  So, the girl comes along and does my pedicure...it's fine, not great, but not awful.  I was rather annoyed that she didn't even dry off my legs and just slapped on some cream.  Cream + watery legs = awkwardness in my opinion.

So, I'm heavily involved in reading my updates on The Jersey Shore and Brangelina when I happen to glance down and she's painting a white flower on my toes.  What?  No.  No, no no.  I do not want a flower.  So I made her take it off and re-paint my big toes.  Who does that?  You ask before you put something so painfully feminine on my feet.  Seriously.

Now, this is where things take a turn for the worse.  I go to pay.  And let me tell you, I haven't paid more than $30 for a pedicure in this town...EVER.  So, they tell me it's going to be $45.  WHAT?  Was that OPI nailpolish made of gold?  Did I just blackout?  Whatever, I move on...nothing I can do now. I hand her my credit card.  She says ""no credit card, use ATM in the corner.""  Uh, what?  So I realize they don't take credit cards or checks.  I have to go withdrawl cash from their mother f^$*^%& ATM machine in the corner that charges me $5 (on top of whatever my bank will charge me) so I can pay for my terrible pedicure.  

This place stinks...there's way too  much competition out there to charge and treat customers like this...DO NOT GO HERE.  Drive down 50 more feet for another salon."
5,Absolutely one of our favorite spots.
5,"What could I possibly say about the Beach House Restaurant and Lounge?  I guess I could think of a few things.

I went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?

To begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  

Do not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.

The AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).

So give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.  And don't you dare forget the tartar sauce."
5,"Delicious!! Huge portions of very authentic Italian dishes.  All entrees, salads, apps and desserts can easily be shared.  Very cozy and wonderful servers.  Can't wait to go back!"
1,"I am shocked over these reviews. I'm going to have to assume its family or something. I was an unfortunate victim of this group of GPs for years. Because of the long list of the things I needed to see Dr. Lyndo for (no longer there) I felt like I couldn't go anywhere else.  I honestly felt trapped.

This is the wonderful help i've gotten.
Dr Daveys sat outside the examining room talking on the phone about his upcoming vacation for well over 15 minutes while I listened. It had only been an hour wait getting in to examination room.

The receptionist are the biggest bunch of rude obnoxious.......they have just about done everything but give me the finger. 

I can't tell you how many times my insurance company didn't ante up so they will call you up to the front of the waiting area and in front of EVERYONE ask about it and ask quite rudely. Then tell me they ""tried"" to call  so I deserve being called up to the front of the class. So embarrassing, especially when your sick. They even called me up when my husband (who had a different insurance plan) had not paid. AND told me I couldn't see the DR because of it! Thats after I had waited fifteen minutes already. I have no idea what I was supposed to do. Go beat up his insurance company?

Then there was the time I was prescribed medication that sent me to the ER. Wait no hold on there was the TWO times that medication was prescribed to me that sent me to the ER.

And the time they told my son he had loose joints when in fact he had scoliosis. Where you get loose joints from curvature of the spine is anyone's guess. 

And then when Dr. Bauer accused me of being a smoker, when I told her I wasn't. She told me I was lying....because you know thats what I do. Lie to GP's....Its a bit of a sinful delight for me. I always hope it gets me improved care......oh wait. 

The long waits where always enjoyable. If I got out of there in less than a hour it would have seemed nothing short of a miracle. You better plan on a lonnnnnng wait. They are making vacation plans after all. 

I could go on for days. This place is awful. **AWFUL***  Please, go somewhere, anywhere else.  The homeless guy on the corner would probably give you better care. He'd be cheaper thats for sure!"
1,"I had been to Macayo's numerous times not because I wanted my colleagues like the place. Every time I go I notice the value of the food and taste is getting worst. Today I went and ordered Chicken Fajitas with side veggies. The fajitas didn't come out sizzling they looked like they must have sat in the window for awhile. The veggies are ice cold with tons of butter and barely cooked. The chicken tasted like they been freezer burned and no seasoning. The dish wasn't appetizing at all.  Also, I service isn't the best  I was with a group and had leftovers and wanted a box and the server didn't even come around. Just drop off the check and walk away. I wouldn't recommend going to this place if you want some good Mexican food."
5,"So my wife and I are  HUGE fans of Cheuvront and the tastings they hold there several times a month. We've done Spanish Cheese tastings, Italian Wine tastings and everything in between and always have a great time! This past weekend was the port tasting and what a great event. I learned a TON about port that I didn't know and got to try several ports that I'd never had. The tastings are typically $15 and include a small plate (or in this case, delicious of pizza). Do yourself a favor and go check out Todd, Jeff and the gang and get on the email list for their tastings. it's always a great time!"
5,"Amazing Friday night FISH FRY! I got out a lot for fish fry's in Madison and the surrounding area and this still remains my favorite. I usually get the Cod dinner, which is always cooked perfect, not too soggy or too crispy, which comes with a side AND a soup or salad for only $9.95. I always recommend the Beach House when someone is looking for a GREAT fish fry! :)"
5,"I love this place! The customer service is second to none. The front desk staff is always friendly and helpful. I have a great hairstylist, and the other services I have received have been wonderful. Even when I am there just on my lunch break to pick up a few things, I am always offered something to drink. Products are recommended, but there is no pressure to make any purchases. It's comfortable, clean, and the staff is always on time. Yay for Perry Monge!!"
1,"The worst Arby's I have ever eaten at. If you want a good one, visit the one on Park. 
So, here is why it is bad.
1) the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered. Four different sandwiches. This is compared to other Arby's I've eaten at.
2) they say they don't have any monthly deals. I was told they belong to the same owner as the one on Park and they have monthly deals.
3) tried it twice and both times they messed up our order. We paid but did not get things.
4) their customer service is awful
I don't expect much in life but when I go somewhere to give them my money , I expect better than what I got here."
1,"Since zero stars is not an option 1 shall do. 

One of the worst dinning experiences EVER!
Me and my party of 4 sat down on a beautiful Saturday afternoon after the PRIDE festival just down the road. We sat and enjoyed the free chips and salsa and nothing else. After 25 minutes and ZERO service of a beverage or even an acknowledgement of our being there we decided to leave. 
If the place had been busy that would have been different but we were 1 of maybe 5 tables being used. 
Sad sad restaurant. 
Never again."
5,Awesome breakfast!
1,"Maybe I caught this restaurant on a bad night, but my experience was terrible. Having no experience with Greek food, I expected my waiter to be knowledgeable and be able to speak English to recommend a dish. However, our server spoke broken English, was extremely touhcy feely and overly attentive. When we arrived there was not a soul to be found in this restaurant. When I asked what certain things were on the menu, I couldn't understand his responses and ended up randomly picking something. My meal was awful. I couldn't tell you what it was, but all I know is I will not be returning."
1,"Hey Gabi M. wish we could agree. On our recent visit there, it became such a comedy of errors that they actually comp'd the entire meal.

A+ for design and architecture, nobody appreciates a fine terrazzo in the bathroom like we do, but D+ for food and service. 

Having said that, it is Hillstone (Houston's) and the one thing they are best known for is their impeccable consistency. 

We are more than confident that they will pull it together in short order and continue to succeed in their real business -- printing money."
5,This place has great fresh cooked and made mexican food.  Out of all the mexican places in Arizona (which are alot but awful) I will go back here
5,"A 5 star gem!

I echo Jenny D's comment on the hash brown. Super crispy exterior and moist fluffy inside - it's a piece of art.  My friend and I enjoyed the generous portion of scramble egg ($7.50), and 2 layers blueberry pancake ($5.00). Everything tasted like ""mom's food."" Made fresh to order, and very satisfying. 

No frou-frou typical Middleton gimmick. The basic decore, and the down to earth service - the perfect spot to watch regulars enjoy the hearty breakfast."
5,Great food. Fantastic staff. Coldest cheladas in town. I mean largest and tastiest and coldest cheladas. The food is delicious. That is the only reason for going out to eat at this place. The best parilla here in Az.
1,"I don't usually write reviews of places at all, but after using Yelp to pick this place as a place to meet up prior to a Diamondbacks game based on the largely positive reviews, I had to come back and let people know not to believe the hype on here.

I am a lover of food and rarely find something that is just plain inedible, but that's what happened with every course of my meal at Coach & Willies. We started out with appetizers including meatballs, Italian nachos, and a wedge salad for the table. The meatballs were actually pretty good and my girlfriend also enjoyed her wedge salad. However, the Italian nachos were just plain disgusting. They reminded me of those cheap $1.50 Totino's pizzas that you can get in the freezer aisle at the grocery. The ""chips"" were mushy on the outside and hard as a brick on the inside; the toppings were clearly cheap and tasted awful. For my meal, I ordered the bourbon steak flat bread wrap. It was absolutely inedible. I was very hungry and was only able to force down two bites of the sandwich before calling it quits -- something that is unheard of for me. 

Altogether, I hope no one else makes the mistake of going to this place and expecting the good food that people here have written about. The menu is rather large and maybe that's why they are having a hard time keeping the food at a high quality. If you go here before a game, I'd recommend sticking to the beers and then getting a hot dog at the field."
1,"Total lack of staffing you can walk all over this store and not find an employee. Its dirty, disorganized, and most the time you are left to having to use self checkout, the have virtually no carts or trollys. To top that off you get accosted by illegal immigrants as drive in to the parking lot and while leaving."
5,"Great food! Love the spicy salsa, the meatball soup and the enchiladas. I'm a sucker for fluffy flavorful yet simple rice and I couldn't get enough of their rice!"
5,"I am a parent of a student entering 6th Grade at Arizona School for the Arts. I work in Education and I talk to Teachers, Curriculum Directors, and Principals from all over the West Coast.  And,I am married to a former teacher at ASA.  I am passionate about this school.

I will admit, I was suspect. I thought the parents who were so ecstic over the education offered at ASA might be a little off.  It couldn't be that good.  Really?  

My son started school with all the aprehensions of a 5th Grade student who knew very little about music, was active in sports and was very sad about leaving his friends behind.  We (even he) chose this school because they had a strong emphasis on education and we expected the school to offer my son the opportunity to learn in an environment that was strict, supportive and creative.  

We were not disappointed. ASA was all that - and MORE! The academic teachers are inventive, collaborative, and very supportive.  The arts teachers are music professionals and perform with and for the students and move them along in the curriculum with such finesse it's like they have private music lessons every day.

And, the year was a success.  My son was delighted with all his classes, especially his music classes with Monica Sauer Anthony.  What a surprise to find him begging us to play his clarinet every evening before we had dinner or before we participted in a famly event.  

He loved the Science Curriculum, the hands-on activity and his teacher's passion  for education.  He worked hard in Language Arts and Social Studies and really showed off his new found maturity and knowledge during Presentation Week.  And the lessons he learned in Life Skills class were really applicable and life changing.

Then the performances at the end of the year were very remarkable and telling. I saw kids excelling in their musical expertise and showing off this success with such poise and confidence that I couldn't believe these were the same kids I met just 10 months prior at our summer welcome parties.

The school does have a rigorous application process that leaves you on edge just wondering if your son or daughter will be permitted entry into this prestigious, blue ribbon school.  The school doesn't tolerate any bullying and supports all types of students. And, the school is near Downtown Phoenix, so there are issues with the campus being spread across some streets, but those are being addressed quickly as they are building and expanding into new facilities that will offer a number of benefits for the ever-growing school.

This school is really a dream.  It's an educational opportunity I would recommend to any parent.  I think my son would write a similiar recommendation!"
5,"This is a Sun Prairie tradition.
Local folks running a local diner.

The food is good with very down to earth service."
1,"What a mess!!! Looking for outdoor fabric and this place is close to home, so it was our first stop. No outdoor fabric could be found, but in fairness, I am not the type of person that likes to ""hunt"" for things. I'm more of a get in get out kinda girl, and this store is most definitely NOT conducive to that way of shopping.

After a quick circle around the shop, we went and asked where the outdoor fabric is. Answer: ""if we have it, I would think it's near the upholstery"". If? Think? We circled again but there is zero organization in the place, and I was shopping with someone that doesn't have patience for that, so we quickly left. 

Also, crowded and dirty. If they had organization, training, and a mop, they would get more business. They could even raise prices. But, I'm sure there are people that would rather dig and shop in a less fancy place to save the money, and if that's you, this is a good place. Never thought I would feel like a fabric store snob, but I guess that's me."
1,"Seriously my frappe was chocolate water disgusting!
How hard is it to make a blended drink?
Sorry but frappes are like my crack so don't mess that up."
1,"What a disappoinment. I eat chipotle at least 5 days out of the week. Its healthy and delicious. I live in Old town Scottsdale so the location on Scottsdale road is where i always go. But, tonight i happened to be coming back from a friends house closer to this one. Since it was on the way i decided to stop here instead of waiting to be closer to home. MISTAKE. The woman who kept bouncing between the cashier and the food line was rude (btw, clearly the cashier girl didnt know what she was doing..but we'll get to that later). I asked her for a vegetarian salad with the rice on the side...she put it in a portion cup and i told her i was sorry and i prefer it to be placed in a bowl instead
 ( i hate the rice all smashed) she proceeded to tell me it was an extra charge. (So to have my rice on the side costs more?! I told her the chipotle by my home never charged me and she said theres nothing she can do. Wow, great customer service. Then i ordered chips and salsa and was charged again for an extra.salsa. it took  while for the cashier girl to even get my order rung up correctly. For someone who eats chipotle sooo much,  you will NEVER see me again at this location. Rude.rude.rude."
5,"So far, the best Rockys.  Friendly and good quality pizzas.  Parking is a bit of a headache, but I usually just pick up and go."
5,This is my very favorite restaurant/bar in downtown Phoenix!  It has great atmosphere from fun to semi-formal and the food is fabulous.  Even breakfast is totally de-lish!
1,"I telephoned the country club to inquire about the Goldwater Women's Tennis Classic.  This telephone call occurred on November 12, 2010 at approximately 6:00 PM.

A woman named CHARMION BILLINGTON answered the phone.  

Never in my life have I experienced a more curt, rude, inconsiderate ""ambassador"" of a country club.

This woman embodies everything that is stereotypical, negative, and distasteful in private country clubs.

I called to inquire about the start times of the tennis matches of the tournament.  Charmion proceeded to inform me, rather dismissively, that she didn't know the times of the matches and nobody was around who did.  

I told her I came in from out of town to see the matches.  Did she know of a website that might have the informaiton I wanted?  She said she didn't know of any website and flatly told me to call back ""tomorrow morning'.

SHE THEN HUNG UP ON ME.

No kidding.  While I was mid-sentence (to thank her, ironically), she hung up.

I went to the tennis matches, in spite of Charmion's classless and rude behavior.  

Everyone else at the club was friendly, helpful, and welcoming.

Perhaps I caught Charmion on a bad day.  But this in no way excuses her complete lack of professionalism.  

Phoenix Country Club ought to re-evaluate this woman.  She is a discredit to their business."
5,Very cool spot with great and friendly service.
5,"I've lived in AZ for almost 20 years and this place is one of my favorite Mexican joints. Huge parking lot and the restaurant seems to get bigger every time we go. Yummy salsa & chips. Cheap margaritas. Delicious food. Machaca is amazing, garlic shrimp is my stand by, and everything else in between. I've never had a bad meal here & service is usually quick."
1,"Serious snooze fest.... and waste of time.    There is nothing mentally or visually  engaging about the desert botanical gardens .  Only visit here if you have young children  who have an appreciation for cacti;  glass and bad salsa.   Definitely, do not bring a date here like I did. (There was nothing else to do in the city )She liked the butterflies ***shrugs***"
5,"I tend to not go to Subways because I think their bread tastes like cardboard but it's hard to ignore the convenience of having them in so many places. Was driving by this one and decided to give it a shot. I wasn't disappointed. I did have a ""buy one 6 inch get one free with a drink"" and it came to $6. Clean location, quick service and compared to others, what got them 5 stars is that my sandwich artist didn't skimp on the ingredients. Felt like I got extra cheese without asking and they were really kind about asking if I didn't want anything else almost perhaps surprised by the fact I like my sandwiches pretty simple. Definitely recommend it."
5,"really inexpensive produce, delicious freshly baked tortillas, amazing fresh juices, just like in south america! and really overall my favorite grocer in the valley! i love supporting local markets, and this one tops them all!"
5,"This is a great place to ""wine"" down after a long week.  For what I have seen - they have the best cheese list in town.  The service is always great and the food is consistently good to great.  Also - who can beat a variety of mac and cheeses.  Last night we had the pancetta and onion - this is probably been my favorite.  I would totally recommend this place for a night where you just want to relax!"
1,"My first time here for lunch. I went with 2 other friends. 

What we had:
Appetizer: artichoke and spinach dip with tortilla chips 
Lunch: fish and chips, and their special of the day meatballs.

We got our appetizer and it was good. The fish and chips were a little on the greasy side, but what do you expect for fried fish and french fries. The meatballs... that's another story. They used a spice in it that had a very strong licorice taste (I think the spice is called anise). There were 4 meatballs for $7.95. I took a small bite off of one and almost gagged. I could not handle the licorice taste. I asked if I can substitute it for fish and chips and make it ""to go"" as we were running out of time. When the check came, they did not take the meatballs off and asked the waitress about it. Come to find out that the OWNER said ""JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE IT, I STILL HAD TO PAY FOR IT!"". I WAS SHOCKED!!!!  I told her, then I didn't want the fish and chips. I only ordered a higher price item as not to walk out with only a $30 bill.  

We ended up leaving paying $46, $8.00 for the meatballs that I only had 1 bite out of! It's a good thing I ate my share of the artichoke dip or I would have STARVED!

I WILL NEVER BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!!!!!"
1,"Rude. Ghetto. Dirty.

Stay away."
1,"I've only been to Jugheads for Sadisco, the goth/industrial night, and I wasn't impressed. Jugheads isn't as much a bar as a series of fences, ramshackle walls and bits of trash. I don't know what the drink prices are like, because I've never felt comfortable enough to have a drink there.

The parking lot is a mess, and I'm surprised there isn't a crash every night. There isn't much room to move, and it's poorly lit. If you do go, try parking in a lot west of the bar, near the Delhi Palace. There's lots of parking there.

During the last Sadisco Fight Club, an amateur brawler was knocked unconscious and couldn't be revived. That resulted in a visit from the cops and paramedics. The bar was shut down, and my $15 cover went to waste. 

I likely won't be back."
1,"Location is the ONLY reason I go to this gym and I've been going to this location and others for the past five years.  This past fall, I had gone to the gym after a few months hiatus.  I was on the treadmill for 30 minutes then went back to my locker.  It was broken into.  My purse and phone were taken but not my car keys or Smart Water.  I guess the robber must have seen what I drove (hint: it's probably an inside job )  There were only 2 staff members on site, both young men-no women on staff (hint: hint: it's probably an inside job then) A police officer did come and I reported the robbery which was the 3rd in two weeks!  The next day, I spoke with the manager.  The same speech he's probably have told others, you can tell the bottom line is the only thing he cares about.  I lost everything plus a $100 bill which was my b-day money and I've spent over a few grand for membership.  I did receive a refund for 3 months but still REALLY!  'Well you shouldn't leave stuff in the locker.  These people go to gym to gym.  We have signs that tell you not to leave items in the lockers""...ummm it was locked and I've been going here for over four years and have never had an issue until now. If you are having robberies, you NEED to tell people not just a sign!  Plus one of the staff told me they were having major issues this past fall...umm that's not someone from the outside that's a staff member doing the robberies!  I found out last week there were MORE robberies!  So if you are looking for a gym, move on and go somewhere else.  It's not the cleanest gym but I like the sauna and that's about it! And then I get a call that they found my purse and calendar in a locker.  The manager never followed up with me and when I got my items they were sfuffed in a drawer and the staff member didn't even seem to care.  I think it's time for a new staff and management!"
1,"My car was overheating and the closest place I could think to take it was this Pep Boys. Let's make a long story short...they quoted me almost $700 because ""all of my hoses needed to be replaced"" along with my thermostat and a coolant flush. Not to mention they were going to charge me EXTRA for a warranty on the parts which is absolutely ludicrous. After talking to a trusted mechanic (who doesn't live in AZ) I took it for a second opinion to Shadow Mountain Auto Service. It was a bit of a drive but I made it. After all, they're yelp reviews are nothing but raving fans. A trusted, hard working, friendly auto business. Not only did they quote me $300 less than Pep Boys but they told me they couldn't find anything wrong with my hoses. It seems to me that Pep Boys DOESN'T do everything for less or even with integrity, for that matter."
1,"Boo bestbuy. You are a major inconvinience for me. And your employees are brain dead. I only like the fact that you are close to my house, but that sorta doesn't count anymore because Circuit city is now closer to me. You know best by, your not the best and maybe I don't wanna buy from you anymore! Why don't you put that in your back pocket?"
1,"Despite the overall fair reviews I was pretty disappointed with this place. I've tried it 3 times and it keeps getting worse! Today I had the full order of ribs w/2 sides, coleslaw and sweet potato fries, (75 cents extra) and a beer, total was $30 w/tip.

My coleslaw was pretty good, the fries were crispy but rather bland, (why didn't they season them?). 

But the big problem were the ribs. I have never had ribs that had the consistency of being boiled. That's right, ""boiled"", as in water!  (Or maybe they keep them soaked in water?). Either way they were almost inedible because my idea of ribs should be BBQ'd in a smoker and then I suppose reheated on a flame grill, right? But to be soggy, wet, fatty and without any real smoky flavor? Come on, for what I spent what a terrible value!

By the way I left $1+ change in the tip cup when I placed my order at the counter and got my change but I didn't receive a thank you for it.

Then I asked for some hot sauce or Tabasco to try to make my ribs palatable and they just ignored me. I could understand if I was rude or complaining but I was wasn't at all.

Also the men's room wasn't too clean either. 

Sorry but after 3 strikes you're out, will never go back."
1,"We decided to veer from our usual favorite place, The Strand, and try something new. Tom's looked appealing so we stopped in. We were both very hungry and the menu had some awesome looking offerings. 

First we ordered the Spinach artichoke dip, as this is one of our favorite appetizers and we like to try it wherever we go. What we didn't realize (which is admittedly our fault) is that it's got jalapeno cheese. The 2 horrible things about this dish were : #1 it's $9.50 and you get the tiniest little cup of dip...seriously...so teeny tiny!!!! Give me a break! And just a handful of stale chips. #2 Who puts jalapeno in spinach artichoke dip? At least SAY SO in the title...when you read ""Spinach Artichoke Dip"" you just assume that's what it will be. Who reads the description, anyway (still, I will take ownership of that part). It was so gross...we sent it back. 

Then the dinner salad. A small plate of iceberg lettuce and a few croutons. Really? 

Then the worst...the cheeseburger. I asked if their medium was still a bit pink inside and was assured that it was. I realize some places interpret medium rare and medium differently which is way I always clarify. Well, this wasn't even close. It was cooked WELL. It was over cooked to the point of a leather consistency. Also, it was so bland. No seasoning or anything. Our waiter asked if I wanted them to cook me another one but even if they got the meat temperature right it still would have been nasty with no taste, so I passed and just sent it back. 

I did eat the fries because I was hungry and it was the only edible thing I got (and not even that good). 

Lastly...our waitress. She sucked. Never checked on us, seemed to not really care, and it wasn't busy so it's not like she was in the weeds or anything. Needless to say we won't be visiting ever again. We're gonna stick with The Strand down the street."
5,"Goodbye Hotels!  After this cozy little place I'm a bed and breakfast faithful.  

Our host, Craig, was wonderful.  It was super easy to make the arrangements and the website was helpful.  The place itself gave me the same joy I remember having when I would go see grandparents as a child.  That feeling of a warm house.  Oh, did I mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning.  

The bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing.  We stayed in the Sorenson room, which was a little larger and had a couch.  They offered a small bookshelf of books and Madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day).  The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  Shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (I think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  

For the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche I've ever had.  Pardon my French! My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  He also had a myriad of drink options.  Some ready to be poured, some in waiting.  Also, for me (the non-vegetarian), he made an incredible side of bacon.  It was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered.  Then it was baked.  Then it was devoured with great speed.  Seriously, this was heavenly.  Also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. 

Craig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.  He is a true gentleman and an excellent host.  

My fiance and I are planning another trip in the spring and we'll be sure to stay with them again.  I could't recommend this place enough."
5,"I have suffered with migraines for 41 years, and if you have had them, you get what it is like to not live life during those times. Mine usually come in clusters, generally not lasting longer than about two weeks - and generally only about 4-5 times a year. As long as I preempt them with medication at the first sign, I am good. 

The last six weeks I have been living in a newfound private hell. Either my body is rebelling (all those wrinkles, lol?) or weather? Whatever it is, this is the longest cluster I have had. I called this office BEYOND DESPERATE. Mayo is booking into October - and I can't take anymore pain. 

I am so impressed with the office staff and the doctor. I have not even been in, and was virtually in tears when they told me they were booking first appts in three weeks. THREE WEEKS??!! It MIGHT as well be next year, with the pain I was in. Bless her heart, the receptionist asked e doctor if she would come in a little early next week one day to see me...and she said YES!

That is old fashioned medical care and service. I haven't even been to the office yet and I am already giving five stars. Impressive."
1,NASTY! Gordon Ramsay would have ripped this place apart. I'm imagining that's why there were only 6 people in this fairly large awkward restaurant on  a Friday night.  Completely outdated overpriced food. $26 for the grossest chicken Francese I have ever eaten. What a ripoff! Also their house wine is $10 a glass ( barefoot brand) will never return.
1,"Apparently I was in the 'formal' Vincent's on Camelback' as opposed to Vincent's Market Bistro so I can't speak to the Bisto.  As for Vincent on Camelback we were very disappointed.  The menu and the staff were really over the top pretentious and the food was just ok.  The choices were extremely limited and very expensive.  For two meals with no drinks or dessert, the bill was over $120.  We got the (small) rack of lamb and some kind of tough wild boar dish with sauce that had a very odd flavor to it.  And not 'odd good.'  It came with a side of parsnip 'potatoes' that made me wish that they would have used real potatoes instead.  I get it. But what has the potato ever done to Vincent to deserve this?  One more thing. . . I forgot.  We ordered a bowl of lobster bisque. I told the waiter that there was no lobster in it. He said that's the way the chef makes it.  Huh?  Please.  Next time maybe I'll have chicken soup with no chicken in it.

Avoid this restaurant.  I can't help but think that the people who left good reviews have had their brains fried by the 120 degree sun in Phoenix."
5,Amazing food! We had the fried chicken on a biscuit sandwiches  one was with the sausage gravy - and the other was the  buffalo one both very good. We had the Hurricanes also very tasty. Definitely going to be on our list of favorites!
1,"I will never be going back.  Its too bad, years ago this was a pretty good place.  recently I got a Groupon 3-pack. 2 of 3 times, my car was not cleaned well.  There were spots and when I pointed it out, the guy told me it was because I didn't add on the wax!!! 

The 3rd trip was the kicker...i decided to add wax just to see whether they actually cleaned the car.  It took about 40-50 minutes(!), didn't look like they had done anything different... And when I got home, I realized they had stolen my iPod from my car!!!  On a previous trip, they stole my husbands phone charger.

DO NOT GO HERE! They will rob you and then give you back a dirty car!"
5,"I like this place. I don't get there often, but it's a nice place to hangout to watch sports."
1,"if i could give them 0 reviews i would. i am in town from CA for epic training & we decided to go to a cheese shop, which is less than 2 miles away. i called twice to confirm the price and also book the cab. the guy told me it would be less than $15 considering it is only 2 miles away. we get there and the driver tells us it is $10 plus $12 for staying in Verona (pretty much getting an extra fee for not going too far). we told him we weren't informed about the fee so he calls the dispatcher who asks ""are they unable to pay?"" so pretty much, if we would've said we're unable, the fee was not required NOR were we informed we had to pay. we give the guy $25, definitely asked for the change back & vowed to never call union can, screw this cab company."
1,"Blindly went to Taylor's with a friend on Sunday (had I known where we were going I would have recommended someplace else). I decided to be open minded and give them another try. I ordered an iced tea and the waffle, he got the poached eggs with hollandaise and a coffee. The server took our orders and returned with an OJ for me, forgivable offense - she took it away and brought me back a an iced tea. 

Then the incredible wait began... An hour later we finally flagged someone down to inquire on our food. He said he would check for us.. We never saw him again. There was a party of 3 and a party of 6 next to us, they both ordered after us and were almost done with their meal... Both parties were complaining about missing items, I overheard a bagel, a side of fruit and a waitress had all disappeared. At this point I was ravenous and we again went to find our server.. She finally brought our food, and it was horrible. The waffle was dry and tasteless and the poached eggs were drenched in hollandaise, thick greasy hollandaise that looked and tasted like it had been sitting on the plate for ages. 

Our horrible breakfast experience lasted 1:40 minutes. Ridiculous. I will not be returning, 3 strikes Taylor's you're out. I left a Yelp card on the table, hopefully they read this an make some improvements."
5,"Finally went on their tour this Saturday, which I actually felt obligated to do, considering how much of their product I ingest on a regular basis. 

Our tour guide was very lively and fun, and knew a looooooot about the process of brewing beer. We also got a small drinking glass as part of our tour, and 3 beer bottle caps that can be traded in for a sample of anything on tap.

You can also trade in all 3 caps for a pint of a single beer, which I wish I had known about before I eagerly sampled my first beer. 

Anywaaays, the tour was short and sweet, and the beer cold and refreshing. 

A perfect break on a Saturday afternoon."
5,I loved the bar! The actual restaurant next door? Not so much.
1,"BEWARE: The owner makes all of the staff pay for their mistakes.

If a mistake occurred, pay special attention to your bill, because the waitress may add on the additional charges without your knowledge. Make sure it's itemized or you'll end up paying for their mistake(s)."
1,"Well, I broke away from my norm which is the lunch lounge across the street in the 501 building to see if I could get a little change, don't get me wrong, the lunch lounge ROCKS! five stars!!! but I wanted to venture out & heard about this place from some co-workers. After waiting 15min to order???? another 15min for my food & Oh BTW having to repeat my order to the girl, I finally got my ham sandwich. The bread was stale & chewy, this was on a Monday and I'm assuming made with old bread left over from the Friday or week before, the ham tasted so processed, and cut a lot thicker than I'm use to? My chips were passed their best eaten by date and the staff just seemed real quite and not so upbeat? I'm going to save my money, walk back across the street and go back to the lunch lounge! their line may be longer for good reason, but I've never waited more than 3 or 4min to place my order, and never more than 10min to get my food. True it takes a couple more minutes to walk across the street, but the Food & service offsets the time, and the staff makes up for that with their fresh, friendly, upbeat attitude! So take it from a true professional foodie, save your money, take the trip across the street, and enjoy some real fresh, home made delights!"
1,"My flight was cancelled and had to stay. They offered a ""distressed rate"" and the staff was nice and friendly. However the rooms are from the 1980's. The furniture looks like it belongs n a Motel Six. The carpets are frayed, the walls and doors are beat up, the hallway carpets are in need of replacing. Upper management should be ashamed to have not upgraded the rooms years ago."
1,"Bottom line, Danny's Family Carousel Car Wash is NOT worth your business... Save your time and money! Your car will not properly be tended to and the staff, especially the Management (Oscar and Martin) couldn't be anymore unprofessional or empathetic. If you care about actually having your car washed, this is NOT the place to go. I have been a faithful customer to this specific location for 3 years since moving into the Biltmore. I used to get my gas, oil-changes and vehicles washed here, but time and time again (chance after chance), my car was left to air dry, rims never cleaned or towel dried, forgotten about the air freshener, etc. I've even had to ask on multiple occasions to have the window writing wiped off before I drove off. It is clearly the most unorganized group of employees I have every witnessed at a car wash facility. I'm a reasonable guy, but when you see a vehicle that happens to be a newer make or model take Presidence over yours (even though you paid the same) it is NOT okay. An on-sight employee gave me Heather's (Danny's Daughter) number in the Corporate office, that I ended up leaving 3 messages for, requesting a call back to bring the latter to her attention. A week later, I received a call back from the receptionist saying that she is TOO busy to return my calls. A week after that call, a random number called my phone 602-694-2244 and a man, (Brian) informed me that Danny does not want my business anymore. I was appalled and tad confused... Brian had no knowledge of my ongoing experiences. I am to this moment embarrassed for him that he would even be instructed to make such a ridiculous  call. This is a lot to read, but if it helps you to make a more informed decision and avoid some serious frustration, let alone having to get your car re-washed, then great! If anyone would like photos (clearly showing the facility, my vehicle,  and its neglect, please let me know). I also have a video showing a Mercedes that was hand washed after mine (the guys spent an extra 3 minutes and 23 seconds on a vehicle twice as small as mine.)  Regards, Chad B."
5,This is the only place I go to take my car...  Fabulously thorough and hands on this  vintage style car wash has a lot of charm. The friendly staff and smartly sassy owner makes me feel like part of the family.
5,"Their food and pastries are good, but most importantly they had the best baklava I've ever had."
1,I sat down at 2p saw server she gave me salsa no chips. Ordered food at 210 and 230 rolled around still no food told server I had to go she said she would be right back 5 minutes later she comes with my food. I seriously had to go so I asked for a box 5 minutes later.box comes. Horrible experience.
1,Not a fan.  We had a breakfast buffet for a meeting there and the food was... not much of a buffet.  Potatoes were cold and greasy and the rest of the food was just not very good.  Have not had lunch or dinner here.
1,My registration tags expired July 31st so they were 1 month overdue. 1 month overdue and within 72 hours they had it towed from my parking spot. It is really really aggressive and unnecessary to hastily tow my car parked in MY assigned spot. The management staff and management company Lincoln Properties do not care about their residents. They explained it was company policy and would do it again.
5,Awesome place. Really nice staff
5,"My vacuum cleaner stopped working on New Year's Eve. I called late and they were open. I planned on just dropping it off.  When I got there, they looked it over - took it in the back, cleaned out the problem and then carried it out to my car - all with a big smile.  I always have excellent service at Olsons.  I own a Kirby and they are always helpful with the care and maintenance.  I highly recommend Olsons!!  When I am ready for my next vacuum cleaner, I will buy from them."
1,"I live in the central phoenix area and this was the best reviewed office around so i decided to give them a shot. My 5mo old puppy had a bit of nasal discharge this morning and after reading up about it online, i decided to seek a professional opinion. This clinic opens at 7am, I called around 7:15 am and got through to their messaging service. The friendly operator said someone will get back with me shortly. An our and a half later, still no call so I brought my puppy in. The front desk and staff were very friendly and let me use a room to wait in due to the condition of my pup. The vet came to see me after 45 minutes of waiting and was surprisingly uninformational, took the pups temperature took a look at him and said ""well it could be anything really"".
I honestly got more information from reading webmd than from going to see Dr. Halver. He prescribed my pup $66 antibiotics and $45 nasal drops on top of a $57 exam fee. I would say comparatively this place is very expensive and I did not feel important to the doctor there. Will not be visiting this clinic again."
1,"I agree  with the comments stating that Luke's has been in a downslide over the past few years.  Also,  Health Inspection Reports are  not good......... Read the specific violations to get your gross-out for the day. www.maricopa.gov - restaurant inspections)
I am still searching for the ultimate Italian Beef sandwich.  Can anyone help (er, ""Yelp"" ) me?"
5,Deliciousness! Love the food!
5,I highly recommend Ultra Collision!  They were extremely helpful throughout the entire process (repairs after an accident where the other person wanted to avoid going though insurance companies) and always looking out for my best interest. I felt like they were fair and honest with the estimate and came highly recommended from the auto mechanic who works on all our vehicles (and is also awesome).  They did an great job on my repairs and my truck was spotless inside and out when we picked it up. (That felt like a huge luxury considering I have two young kids and my truck is rarely ever spotless!).
1,We got there and told them we had a party of 8 but wouldn't seat us until all 8 arrived or even take our name down. When the other 4 arrived they wanted to seat us separate like opposite sides of the restaurant. Told us 15 to 30 minutes and seated people they arrived AFTER us BEFORE us. After 40 minutes. We said something. Got us two tables not together. Finally. If it wasn't for our server it would have been horrible. Very disorganized and hostess couldn't even do their job. Won't come back. Only reason it actually got one star was due to the server.
1,"I remember when going to the Spaghetti Company was something to look forward to. Back then (about 30 years ago) it was one of the few restaurants in town, so the wait was considerable. That lobby is still there with the same stand-up video games and circa 20s sofas (reupholstered of course) and the restaurant still seems to be a place for an adventurous child to find hidden secrets and exotic places. Back then the wait to sit in the trolley (since removed and replaced with a replica) was over an hour. As a child the mystique of its cavernous faux Tiffany-style glass-enclosed ""rooms"" was a wondrous delight that could now only be matched in adult scale by the extravagance of the Winchester mansion of California.

I've been back 4 or 5 times in recent months and am consistently surprised that for a restaurant that could seat a thousand, I must wait 10 to 15 minutes for a table. Tonight I was making my way back across the cavernous lobby to leave when I was called to be seated. I should have just left.

Once inside I discover why the wait is so long. Every table as far as the eye can see is covered with dirty dishes and glasses, but no one is sitting at any of them. How long they have been in such a state is anyone's guess, but tonight I was able to sit in the fake trolley and so was afforded the opportunity to see that only 2 of them were cleared throughout my entire meal. What a disgrace! You all should be ashamed of yourselves!

Our server was extremely attentive and did his job with careful precision and punctuality. The only major error was when he kicked a piece of trash in the small walkway between trolley tables to a nearby corner. Oh my God; I just wanted to get up and go over and pick it up. Was that a crust of bread??!?!?! When he first arrived at our table, I asked if he needed some help clearing all these tables. What a disgrace! He told me that when he walked in, there were 130 people waiting in the lobby.

The food was exactly as expected -- somewhere below the quality of an Olive Garden. I think someone else here may have made the same comparison. Pasta overcooked to the point it can just barely hold its form anymore; meat sauce so gritty you wonder if this is what Manwich tastes like. Meatballs well formed and of overall good taste, but spiced with powdered everything, and old powder at that. Parmesan passed my test with little recognizable filler and of good body. Didn't taste like sawdust.

Bread obviously ordered by the hundred thousand, and obviously arrived frozen and partially cooked, Shamrock style, with the finish in a quick-heat just before serving. The cutting boards still have a second indentation for the garlic butter, but none was served. The butter that arrived was nothing like butter, but instead a whipped watery creamy colored stuff that should be the last straw that finally convinces you to throw down your napkin and sue ""I can't believe it's not butter"" for false advertising.

The salad was mostly dismal. The only redeeming ingredient in the entire meal was the olive oil used in the ""balsamic"" vinaigrette. I had to take several concentrated bites to try to convince myself that the red-wine vinegar they were trying to pass off as Balsamic was not actually cleaning-grade white vinegar, but the olive oil was really nice. Never mind  the basil or parsley or the whatever-name-you-can-come-up-with tasteless flakes in the dressing that had to be at least 20 years old. Ew.

There are times when I wish I could go back. I wish I hadn't dined under the artistry of chefs who celebrate the creation of cuisine. I used to be able to enjoy this crap, oblivious to the talent that's out there. Unfortunately Phoenix is slowly but surely returning to its roots. Where is our talent? Surely it is not at the Old Spaghetti Factory."
1,".I ordered the pizza and 2 dozen wings for me and a friend.  The wings weren't cooked as I asked....they were very wet rather than extra crispy and they gave only two small plastic cups of ranch, you know the ones I'm taking about, can't even fit the tip of a wing in the cup. After 8 wings the ranch was gone. 

As for the pizza...it is NOT fresh...I think it's actually a frozen pizza.  Was horrible and I couldn't even eat more than one slice...waste of my money.

The place is very dirty. The kitchen is falling apart, it makes me gag just looking at it. The dining area is filled with too much junk. It would be better if they take half the junk out of there and rid themselves of those old and unused arcade machines, broken toys and clocks and sun bleached decorations.
Dusting is not a priority. If a big gust of wind comes in when someone opens the door you better cover your food.


I think the only reason this place is somewhat busy at times is because there really isn't any other place in the immediate area. I also think people go there because it USED to be good."
1,Regular customers.  Like the food but went in tonight while it was busy and got horrible service- from the owner no less!  It's on thing to be busy but to be blown off like we were was very disappointing.  We probably wont go back.  Definitely won't recommend.
5,"The burgers are amazing and ridiculously reasonable! The staff is friendly and attentive. The place is super clean! They do everything right at Players! Good drinks, great lunch specials and awesome service!"
1,"i went in to exchange my BRAND NEW, STILL IN PACKAGE aquarium filter, and was told that without a receipt, I would not be able to exchange it.

this goes for all aquarium products over $10.

the manager was surprisingly rude, and didn't even attempt to save my business as i walked out of the door with my money that i will never spend at this pitiful excuse for a pet store.

CRAPPY!!!!!!!!"
5,"Ranch Market... nothing like it in Arizona.  Even better than Lee Lee's!  This place is an EMPORIUM of great, high-quality, inexpensive food.  The produce is exceptional and once you into the spirit of the butcher (ie. any part of the animal you want, you can get) the quality is also very high.  Fresh tortillas made all day long and a really festive atmosphere round it out."
1,"Geoff B., I had a similar bad experience.
I ordered a chicken sandwich at this restaurant without mayo -- after waiting quite a while (I was one of two people in line), I finally received my sandwich. I checked the sandwich outside, just to be sure it had no mayo...it did. I returned, told the man who took my order (perhaps the owner?) that the sandwich had mayo -- he grabbed it from my hands, and gave it to one of his workers, who then came back with it about two minutes later. I thanked him and left. I again checked the sandwich when I got outside, and saw that the bread had been replaced, but mayo was still all over the chicken. I returned to the restaurant and told the man that it still had mayo, the man yelled at me and slammed the sandwich on the counter, insisting the sandwich did not have mayo. I showed him that mayo was still all over the chicken and asked for my money back -- a nicer man from the back of the restaurant thankfully came out and apologized and returned my money. 
Perhaps it's time for the younger gentleman to take over management of this restaurant."
5,I LOVE Ultimate! A friend referred me to Alyssa and she is who has done my hair for the past two years! She's great and always makes me hair better than I imagined. The salon is nice. Other reviews say they are pricey but you get what you pay for. I get a paraffin dip and neck/scalp massage when I get my hair done. I'm not sitting there all day like other places. The front desk is very friendly and I even get mailed coupons for discounted services. I will be going back as long as I'm living in Madison. :)
5,"Had brunch here this morning (Sunday), and there was exactly one other table of diners there the whole time we were there. I don't understand why this place was so empty when Matt's Big Breakfast has lines out the door. Oh well, better for me. 

Once again, Cheuvront did not disappoint. The blueberry muffins that come to the table, piping hot, were lovely. I ordered the Eggs Benedict Cheuvront, which consists of lightly poached eggs, black forest ham, and a delicious poblano hollandaise over a toasted baguette. The potatoes on the side were spiked with rosemary and so tasty dragged through the hollandaise (but then, what isn't?).

My friends ordered the egg white omelet and the fritatta, and both cleaned their plates."
5,"Great coffee and some of the best eggs I've ever had. It's sort of a hole in the wall, but that adds to the ambiance. Super nice wait staff, too."
1,"There really should be some kind of board that gives accrediation to restaurants claiming to be ""Mexican."" That way the consumer would know that places like Taco Bell, Pedro's and ChiChi's (if they're even still open) are not really Mexican restaurants, even though they purport to be. That way folks wouldn't be fooled into eating at a ""Mexican Restaurante"" just because there's an ""e"" at the end of ""Restaurant."" 

After my meal at Pedro's, I decided to just hit up Taco Bell the next time I'm in Madison and I want ""Mexican."" It's just as crappy as this place, but far easier on the pocketbook. 

This place is an afront to the people of Mexico and their cuisine."

5,"We love love love the Old Spaghetti Factory. I don't think there's been a single time I've been that I haven't had to wait, but it's ALWAYS worth it. I love their lasagna, the bread is really good. They have huge portion sizes, so we split a plate usually when we go, but it's so well worth it. The service has always been really good too. I will definitely go back again and again."
5,"My only regret with this place is that I worked neaby for years without knowing it was there!  I'm a vegetarian and I love the variety with the wraps, the soup and the sides.  I've tried many different wraps and each one was great!"
5,"OK ok ok.  I'll have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isn't dead-on authentic Mexican food.  That being said, I love it!  The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.  

The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.  

The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.

I guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff.  There were so many cool things to check out in this multi-plex, and the atmosphere was so warm that I'd love to head back again soon."
1,"This was my first time being there. The smell of the place was kind of stinky. The lady took my order and seemed like she was in a rush (there were no lines).

I got my food and drink. The milk tasted bad so I took it back up there and the lady was really rude about it.

I ordered the steak kabobs with roasted vegetables and potatoes. The steak itself was tasty. Juicy. Flavorful. The vegetables were old, and the potatoes were soggy and flavorless. 

It's good to try new things so you know not to go there ever again :)"
5,Franoni's is 100% reliable - always delicious. Subs are awesome and great for taiilgating. There are also great frozen dinners for home and great food ideas for parties. The Italian grocery store is the best in Madison. I've been partaking in Fraboni's deliciousness for more than 20 years!
1,"So many better breweries than this! Attempted to use a 50$ gift cert and was told (after I ordered beers ) that they could only be used in $15 increments once a year... I was still responsible for the beers because she had poured them. She conferred w mgmt, same response. I explained I don't live anywhere near there and would never use them again. Her response was ""well.. You can always... Well... Uh, just give them away.""  Great, I'm sure that was the intended use when a friend gave them to me for my birthday.  If the ""mgmt"" of a local place doesn't have the  sense to make it a worthwhile experience for their paying customer, then what is there to do? Very disappointed in their service. Ps I've bartended before and never seen someone grab the ticket and then dunk it on top of the drink they have going out.  I witnessed this time and time again. She would grab and hold the ticket, then dunk into the top of the beer. The waitress would grab the beer and scoop out the ticket. Necessary? No. I will not be back."
5,I read the Yelp reviews online and decided to give them a try. I was very impressed by their professionalism. My car was delivered as promised and they kept me informed the entire time. I highly recommend them! You can't even tell I had work done!! Whoot Whoot!!!
5,"We visited the Arizona Science Center for the National Geographic's Real Pirates. Grabbed their Groupon, our family friends, who were in town and headed downtown!

Make sure you download the Groupon to your device before you enter the building, our AT&T coverage ceased to exist inside all the cement walls. No problem we walked back out the front and downloaded it. Get your parking validated too, it reduces the price from $12.00, to only $3.00. 

We got our Pirate tickets affixed our wristbands and took the elevator straight to the third floor exhibit. It all starts with a intro movie and a great entry into the actual exhibit. There were so many artifacts from the Whydah (whee-duh)!  My favorite was all the booty the pirates had plundered!  One liked the pistols, cannons, cannon shot and replica ship. The younger boys liked all the items they could touch and pick up!!  Our daughter loved the ship's bell and all the gold artifacts, especially the jewelry! The oldest of the kiddos liked the gift shop at the end of the exhibit. There were lots great pirate trinkets for all ages! I felt like a kid again, reading ""Treasure Island""!

The science center had other great exhibits on the other floors as well. The youngest boys liked the Monster Stomach!  If you've been to the science center you know why, if you haven't, you'll just have to make a visit and find out for yourself. 

The Freeman exhibit was also great!  Our kids enjoyed the pipes & valves, but had trouble putting them together. Not a plumber in the bunch! The adults tried to stack wooden blocks to create standing masterpieces, not an architect in our group either. 

Another draw was the SkyCycle!  A bicycle suspended above the first floor along a thick cable. Each adventurous ride will cost you $5.00 as a non-member, $3.00 for members. We enjoyed watching everyone ride across the sky. 

Everyone really enjoyed the MindBall challenge!  Two people put on the connectors and try to relax.  The person who relaxes most moves the ball till it reaches the other end. I was able to out relax them all, even with my two kids trying to distract me!

We didn't go to the IMAX theater/Planetarium, we had reservations at Rustler's Rooste!"
5,"I must say Fate was the only positive thing I gained from an otherwise awful date. The food was fantastic. I had the green chicken curry. It had the perfect mixture of spices and it was not too spicy for a curry dish. I wasn't  expecting the curry sauce to be creamy. The sauce had a light green split pee hue, but despite the odd color the flavor was amazing. The meals were fairly priced. I believe my dinner was around the same price as my first drink...$10.00-$12.00. I enjoyed the artistic ambiance. The staff was polite and our food and drinks were delivered to us promptly. I have read other reviews about the hostess's being rude...luckily I haven't experienced that. Even if I had e negative staff experience I would still recommend Fate for the food alone."
5,"Cute little place with both outdoor  (with misters) and indoor seating.  Excellent teriyaki and salad.  Very attentive owner and staff.  Large portions and great prices $5.49 & we could easily have split one.  Next time, we will, and we'll try some of the super inexpensive appetizers...pot stickers, egg rolls.  A fresh healthy meal."
1,"Well... 

My mom was still in town when I gave it another chance. She doesn't live in the states and she was so looking forward to having the salad! Can't say no to mom, right? 

So mom picked up the salad to go and again... TINY. $15 for a side salad. (Please see picture of it next to a piece of paper and you'll see what I mean fellow Houston old timers.) 

The great news was that we were able to ADD our own mixed greens to the salad to make it enough for one person + a bite for another person here and there. 

But really? Who wants to add their own greens to a salad? Defeats one of the main reason for restaurants is that you don't have to do anything except eat and enjoy. 

Just not with Hillstone's Grilled Chicken Salad..."
1,"We mistakenly chose to host an 65th wedding anniversary family celebration at Vincent's.   At the end of the meal, as we were trying to collect our uneaten desserts, Vincent became enraged by the delay to his waiters' ability to clear the table.  (We later surmised that the threat of overtime pay prompted this entirely inappropriate, frightening response.)  The alternative and civil approach would have been to help the guests while simultaneously clearing.  
The honorees, ages 87 and 88, had been loyal and frequent customers for over 30 years.  They were deeply shaken and frightened by Vincent's threatening loss of self control (which escalated to threats and his grabbing of my 87 year old mother's arm).  No member of my family will ever step foot near this establishment again.   Unfortunately, Vincent's inappropriate behavior trumped any value associated with food."
5,Came here for a kolachi but only the northern location has them. Oh well. But still enjoyed the maple bacon donut and the sprinkle donut. Not good for the diet but good for the soul. The lady behind counter was super sweet and nice. Really liked the friendly atmosphere.
1,"TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT! - Over a year after I quit working at this IHOP because of terrible management. I called in a to-go order for my boyfriend and I - When I got there, I ended up having issues with my debit card so I ended up running across the street to pull money out of the bank. When I got back, I asked Jenelle, the manager, if I could have my food warmed up cause it was cold and she approached me with an atrocious attitude, and told me nope and walked off. So I said, alright, forget it, and left the $30.00 in food and walked out the door. I will never eat there again because I've come to the conclusion that there food gets cold and hard almost immediately."
1,"My husband and I visit the zoo in every city we end up in, so Phoenix was no exception. After reading some lovely reviews online, we were excited to come to this zoo with our hopes high. Upon entering, there were very few sign pointing to anything to see, the map didn't even help half the time. They apparently allow bicycles in he zoo, too?! What a horrible idea! Many of the exhibits were being maintained or he animals wee simply not there. The employees were racing around in their vehicles all day with little care for the visitors scurrying to not be hit. They had so many events planned for the day that the employees were over worked! At 10 after 4 employees were driving around asking everyoneto leave asap as there was a wedding scheduled for the evening. After paying $18 per person for this less than good zoo, we didn't rush out. What a waste of time! Save your $18 for something better!"
5,"If this place were called Cheers, call me Norm. 
The small town feel with big, helpful personalities is exactly what I expect from a hole in the wall and WA is nothing less. So thrilled that Steve L got me there! 

Cash only!"
1,Pinnacle At Towne Center raised rent $200 per month our second year living in the complex.
1,"I arrived mid-day, with one goal in mind - buying a new mattress for the guest room.  This should have been a very quick purchase, since I pretty much knew exactly what I wanted.  Unfortunately, the salesperson didn't even bother to acknowledge my presence for over 5 minutes.  Finally, I got a quick ""hi"", and he went back to his other customer.  I walked up and down every aisle in the store, waiting, waiting, waiting, while he walked them from bed to bed while they tried laying on each one.  Seriously? I could have chosen and paid for my bed in the amount of time it took them to try out just one!  Someone needs to instruct him on handling multiple customers at once.  Two isn't really that many! Since the salesman was clearly more interested in serving them, I left and bought my bed at Mattress Firm instead."
5,"I hosted my granddaughter's 6th birthday party at the Arizona Science Center on April 5, 2014. They did an EXCELLENT job from the first phone call  to the end of the party. Children and adults had a wonderful time and many of the guests took advantage of the free admission to the Center following the party. Five or six staff members were present throughout the party and assisted with activities, serving food, slime demonstration, etc. We have held birthday parties at several locations in the area and none have been as well-organized and fun as this one was. Thank you Science Center!"
1,"Don't bother.  Overpriced, immemorable food served by a creepy waiter.  AND he didn't bother to tell me when I asked for water for the table that it would be $6 a bottle!!!!  

Yuck to the whole experience here."
1,"Took in one pair of pants to have a small hole in the groin area fixed. They took an extra two days then stated, was way over priced, and the pants look awful. Actually had to take them some where else in order to get them to being wearable again, will never go back."
1,"I am from Chicago where authentic Mexican restaurants are abundant. I would not consider what I ate yesterday at Matador Mexican food. 

The waiter brought chips & salsa to the table. The salsa was a spicy red sauce that I would pour over pasta....I'm dead serious! The fish taco entree arrived quickly. There was a ton of fish which was nice, but it came with a side of shredded ""cheddar"" cheese, shredded cabbage and chopped tomato. The rice & beans that came with were no better. I think the rice was Rice-O-Roni and the beans had a think layer of burnt ""cheddar'"" cheese on top. WTF am I suppose to do with that?

This was my first meal in AZ. It has to get better than that."
1,"This was my first time to this place and probably the last! When you walk in to any service business you expect a certain amount of kindness and professionalism. Well not here. we were met with a rude cashier who kept screaming NEXT as if there was no one in line. Next I saw all these signs telling you what you can't do in this place like do not dump anything in the soda dispenser drain and check your order before you leave and so on. Finally when we were able to place a order the extremely rude cashier seemed so irritated that we actually had the nerve to enter this place that she had no desire to even take our order or answer any questions that we had. The price was decent but on the expensive side, 20 dollars for 2 people without drinks. So we finally get our order and knowing that i have to check my bag because i read the sign that had it printed in BOLD letters, I noticed that I was missing my potato salad. So the rude cashier looks over and says WHAT. And I said I'm missing my potato salad so she opens the cooler and basically throws it at me with very good accuracy as if she has done this many times. So then my brother asked her if she missed his potato salad also and she screams out I DON'T KNOW CHECK YOUR BAG, As if she has somehow forgotten what she put in there 30 seconds ago. 

Bottom line food is good but it's not worth the effort you have to go through to get it. The staff is so bad that I will go out of my way to go somewhere else. The owners should be aware that the service of this place has gotten to the point that people won't even go there so they don't have to deal with the worst service they have ever had. In todays economy where people are choosing carefully where to spend their money you need to have something special and this place should put up a big sign that says:

GO AWAY WE DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY!!!!!

They will never get anymore of mine."
5,"I love this place. Best Horchata in Phoenix (you have to get it early though because they keep it cold with ice so by late in the day it is slightly watered down and the ideal heterogeneous concentration is lost). The food court inside is amazing. I have been there more times than you and have never had a problem with any of the food or staff. Sometimes communication can be difficult when ordering but if you know exactly what you want (like me) or unless you are fluent in Spanish (which I am not) there should be no problem, so no lallygagging around and no special orders. 

The constant excitement added with a little bit of the English vs. Spanish war gives you the warmth and feel of a truly authentic Phoenix super market food court (I am sure there is some special name for it in the Hispanic culture, or at least something that sounds cooler than food court). I am fortunate that within my lifetime to have lived within a 5 minute drive of the Ranch Market, and I miss it dearly.

I know there are a lot of grocery stores called ""Ranch Market"" throughout the Valley, but when you live anywhere near this one it is the ONLY Ranch Market you will acknowledge. Go there, get a 1/2 pound of carnitas from the cooked meat section, it comes with corn tortillas and some green salsa/sauce/concoction that goes with it great. Don't forget the beans and rice. Salsa bar is on the left on the way out. 

The prices are great. Best bang for your buck in this town."
5,"This place was a bit of a surprise. We flew into Madison and were starving. We always rely on Yelp when we travel, it was close and this place did not disappoint. It is inside a flight services building but the place is really clean and a nice view of the runway.I had the BLTCE and my wife had the flying fish sandwich and both were really good. We will be back, check it out."
1,"First off FRYS you need to treat your employees much better especially the employee I seen that was being talk down to because of his age. Let me paint you a picture of what I seen and heard. I went there and was behind an elderly gentleman carrying his little bag with his lunch he was limping and had on a Frys apron. He went to the front manager and asked him if there was a department he could work that day because he was just not feeling to good. It appeared he was just asking for that day. The front end manger replied, ""I am not sure I don't know if you know how to do anything else. I just need you to pick up the speed where you are know before I consider anything else. I know I was nosing in his business but it was very heart breaking and degrading at the same time. Let me tell you something Mr, Front end Manager this elderly man is probably the last few of his kind that knows how to work and I am sure worked his tail off. Do NOT ever talk to that generation with anything but respect and kind  assistance where you can offer it. That is if he even allows you because that generation never looked for handout and that is why this gentleman is still working and packing his little lunch to show up for work and not call in like many would or I am just assuming with your company maybe that will be your excuse to let him go. So after listening to this and no it was not my business but I am sure half the things anyone witness in public is not anyone's business but we still slow down to see the wreck. So I proceeded to get my $325.00 of groceries at your place when I should have walked right out and drove down the road. I went isle to isle and as I neared the front another female front end was barking out orders to the checkers yelling right in my ear. Yes, I looked at her and gave her one of my signature looks (Are you serious what is wrong with you) type of look and she continued to degrade the front end employees. However it must not have had an effect on these two clowns that checked me out. Because they were laughing at other people with disabilities and bagging my groceries like they were tossing rocks in a pile. Now let me gentle remind you FRYS without your customers you are nobody and word of mouth travels so fast and as you know all the advertising on billboards cannot compare for a bad experience and a woman that will make it her job to inform the abuse this elderly man took on this day. I was never going to step foot in this store but that is wrong to complain -and not do something. So every week about 2 times I make it a point to check to see if this gentleman still works there and that he may be treated a little more kinder. SHAME ON YOU! for allowing these putz kids to act like idiots and the little feeble elderly man that apparently needs the job and comes to work to make the best out of it is treated with such degrading words and gestures. I wanted to reach in my purse and give him his wage for the day and whip on his apron and show your little store what compassion really means. But I figure this is a generation with great pride and it would do nothing more than make him feel worse. Mark my words! If I ever have your front end manager yell in my ear as I pass by or witness your employees show this man any disrespect you will hear my opinion yell right back and you know those people who holds signs and marches in front of your store well there is a truck full of worker down by Home depot that I can get together that you will see my opinion loud and clear."
1,"I gave it one star because I'm all about animals finding forever loving homes. But that's where the positive praise ends for me.

We visited here several times in search of our next doggie family member. Never were we greeted. Not even a mean greeting, or a rude greeting... No greeting. It seems anyone can just walk in here and roam around. That was always a red flag to me when I went there but we wanted to rescue a dog and give it a loving home, so we continued to go.

Finally, we found a dog that didn't have ""adoption pending"" on it's kennel, since almost all do there ( maybe try keeping animals who are already adopted separate from available ones,DCHS?). We had to track down a staff member since none ever seem to be around even monitoring the dog kennels (another red flag). Finally we did and we asked to see the dog. Here's where it really got weird...

The two women, who never introduced themselves (I refer to them as the blonde and the brunette) seemed very adamant about us taking him that same evening. They hadn't asked us any interview questions like other shelters do... They never even asked us what type of home he'd be in or anything. they asked us if we had kids, if we lived alone, and if we owned our home. Apparently three questions answered and you can take home a dog? ( horrible). But we were so excited about the dog we weren't really thinking about their lack of questions or how pushy they seemed about us taking him right away.

Once we got home with him we learned why they were so pushy. They told us he was so sweet... Such a calm guy, loving etc. They said he got nervous in the kennel but that's it. We bring him home and within a few hours he is biting us, growling at us, and literally grabbed my subway sand which out of my hand the second I picked it up .. When I tried to say no and get my sandwich back he bit my hand and drew blood. Later he also stole the remote out of my boyfriends hand and tore it to pieces in a second. He growls everytime you go near him.. And this is while we are talking in calm quiet voices, moving slowly, trying to do anything to make him feel calmer.

He has now bitten us each multiple times in 12 hrs.. He knocks anything over (plants, anything on the counter) and growls at you and tries to bite if you run to pick it up.

I'm not mad at the dog. It isn't his fault he probably was abused in previous homes. But- it was absolutely the DCHS job to tell us he was aggressive. To tell us he bites and snarls and growls. To tell us he may guard food even food that isn't his. Were furious that they completely lied to us and were so pushy about us taking him immediately (no wonder why though). Do NOT adopt a dog from here simply because these people have no business conducting behavioral assessments on dogs as they failed with this one... They also are illegally lying to people to get them to take home a dog. 

We are furious and wanted this dog more than anything but we deserved to be properly prepared for the way he is so aggressive. We told them we wanted a calm family dog who was a sweetie and we go on runs with. They had him in the shelter for a month- if we learned his behaviors in a day, I'm sure they knew all about his biting and aggression. I've had many dogs all who were trained by me and I have never seen a dog with this level of aggression in my life. I'm severely disappointed in the DCHS.

Bottom line: do not misrepresent your animals. Do not lie to the consumer. This is illegal."
5,can you believe such a beautiful place? my stepson loves the thai pavililion and i love hte ability to have a place like that here in town.
5,This Safeway is so good.  These people with the bad reviews need to take their bad attiudes somewhere else.  Everyone is ALWAYS so friendly - I visit here nearly every day since the store is near my workplace.  Jesus the check out dude is the best.
1,"I don't recommend going there.  My wife and I decided to go there for some dessert after a very nice dinner.  I wanted an ""Apple Pie A la Cold Stone"".  I have had this before and it is normally very good.  I was told that they had been out of the pie filling for a while.  Yet this is one of their ""Signature Creations"".  I would expect that if this is something that they always have that they would have on their menu, they would have the ingredients for it.  Then, My wife ordered their seasonal ""Funnel Cake Sundae.  My wife ended up waiting 15 minutes for this.  Jacob and Chad told us that they had to reheat the Funnel cake for the sundae twice.  This made is rock hard and she had to throw most of the funnel cake away because she could not eat it.  As we were waiting, I noticed how dirty the entire interior was.  It looks like the floors and base boards have not cleaning in months.  Tables and floors were dirty and sticky-GROSS.  I did not check the bathrooms, too scared to try.  On top of all this, the price for their ""Creations"" is way too high!!!  I am tempted to call the health department for an inspection.  DON""T GO THERE!!!  it is a waste of time and money."
1,"Nice decorations and inerior, that's about it. The waitress is not helping at all for selecting good menu. They are charging for hot tea and pepper oil.(I guess they need to do that recover from investing for the interior.) Go ahead cross the street and go to the food court in the mall. They have better service and half lower price for the better food."
1,"I don't know why I keep gravitating back to this HRC location because it's always been just blah at best. Last night's dinner was no different.

Went with a party of 7 and we were smart to use their Please Excuse service found on the website so that we could cut to the front of the line before the Suns game. 

The place was busy and our server appeared capable, but looks can be deceiving. As it turns out, service was what it usually is, slow. We had a mixture of sodas, water, beer, and mixed drinks at our table and unless we ASKED for a refill, it wasn't coming. We would have spent more on alcohol if the server seemed remotely interested in serving us.

Our appetizers took FOREVER to come out. Meanwhile glasses sat empty on the table. The appetizers finally came--we ordered the sampler tray and a chicken quesadilla. It was tasty. Nothing special. The potato skins were particularly notable though as they were perfectly done and NOT greasy. Refills FINALLY came after we had to ask twice for them. 

Dinner comes out before the appetizer dishes were cleared and we were starting to have an excessive amount of glasses and bottles on the table that the server didn't feel necessary to remove from the table. *sigh*

Most of us had burgers and they were all just basic burgers. I had the california burger and it was a big sloppy mess. Someone had the bright idea of putting the guac on the burger before the cheese. The cheese is the glue and the guac goes on the bun. As soon as I attempted to pick it up to eat, everything slid all over and I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife. The fries were bland. And we waited again and again for refills.

It's conveniently located right across the street from the Suns arena and I think this is really the last time I""m going to subject myself to this place. I've been to MANY HRC's across the globe and this one is the worst one. 

Can't SOMEONE put a decent place in downtown Phoenix? PLEASE!"
1,"I will not be returning to this Chipotle, the service was terrible. I could have received better service form an rock in Death Valley. First time here and could not believe the lack of customer service this place had... The girls behind the counter acted like they just found out their best-frienmy just stole their man... I'm easy to please, its a fast food restaurant, how picky can I really be.... honestly... I was ordering 2 bowls and it was the end of the world for this girl. I asked for extra onions and peppers for 1 of the bowls and i kid you not, there was about 5 pieces.... so i asked the next girl for more... generally thats what EXTRA means and she gave me 5 more pieces. After I had realized what kind of service i was dealing with I didn't dare to ask for anything special. Get home and first my boyfriend was like uh where are the onions and peppers... my response was ""the little you have... in the middle of your bowl""... Not to mention, i go to take a bite of my bowl and the meat was COLD. Not luke warm, but COLD like it had been sitting there for hours... not being stirred... just growing bacteria.... Ive never wrote a review like this... my reviews are 4-5 stars ALWAYS, but this was just unacceptable."
1,"Tried this place out after seeing the other decent Yelp reviews and wanting to try a new place for lunch. Service was very friendly, but giving one star due to the big disappointment in the food and outdoor patio area. The full size salad there was $6 and definitely not something that would fill you up for lunch. It also was full of sad, almost white iceberg lettuce, with a scant few other veggies. No place to sit outside due to broken umbrellas, un-bussed tables and bird ""stuff"" on one of the tables. The inside seemed okay other than that it was too cold, and the news that was on the TV with one horrific story after the other -- not something you want on over lunch. Had to go to another place afterwards since I was still hungry. Won't be coming back here unfortunately. :("
1,"I just experienced this restaurant for the second time.  My first time around, the food and service were decent and the nifty sushi dessert made the overall experience pretty cool. 

The second time around, it was pretty horrendous.  My boyfriend and I were driving around trying to find a place on which we could both agree.  I was craving sushi, and he's not crazy about sushi.  Ultimately, Moto came to my mind--because they have some basic sushi rolls (although no raw salmon or really much raw nigiri to speak of) along with lots of other food. 

So, Moto it was.  On arrival, as we walked up, we noticed a couple of empty tables inside so we weren't too worried about having to wait.  But, when we got inside, the host basically just pointed at a table at the bar, had us sit down, and then threw two menus onto the table and walked away. 

As we sat at a table in the bar area--although we wanted to eat in the actual restaurant area--my boyfriend immediately noticed that the couple sitting behind us was completely hammered.  I listened for a moment, and indeed, they were screaming.  Screaming their conversation.  And they were discussing herpes sores.  They appeared to be on a date, discussing herpes sores, and the female occasionally mentioned her DAUGHTER.  

So after listening to some loud herpes convo for a few moments, my boyfriend went and asked the host if they had a different table, inside the actual restaurant portion.  We were added to a list.  

About 5 minutes later, a waitress approached, and I'm 99.9% sure that she was intoxicated.  Not just slightly inebriated, either, but kind of ridiculous drunk.  She looked all glazed over as she asked if we wanted any drinks.  I asked if they had a drink menu and she stared at me like she was really confused.  Then I asked if they had a cocktail menu, and she said, no, we have a menu of beer and wine.  She gave me a weird look.  So, thinking I was mistaken about the drink situation, I asked, do you guys have a full bar? 

She said, oh, yes!  What do you like!?!?  I like fruity drinks, so I asked if they had Stoli Razzberri (or however it's spelled).  She said, ""I LOVE THAT.  THAT'S MY FAVORITE.""  Then she informed me that she wasn't sure if they had it, but she would check.  My boyfriend (who was driving) requested a water, and the waitress walked away. 

Eventually after enduring more conversation about that chick's kid and various human ailments (herpes, chicken pox, the flu), the host told us they had a table for us.  He walked us to the table and threw menus on it.  As he started to walk away, I mentioned to him that I had ordered a drink from the waitress at the other table and I didn't want her to wonder where we went.  He said he'd already told her about it, and not to worry.  A few seconds later, he brought the drink over and set it down.  Oddly, the drink was pink, and a Stoli Razz & tonic isn't usually pink.  But I figured it looked interesting so I'd give it a shot anyway.  

Shortly thereafter, our actual waitress approached.  She immediately started LECTURING us about how we can't just order drinks at the bar and walk away without cashing out at the bar.  She went on for a while about how we needed to go back and cash out at the bar.  We explained that we never meant to sit at the bar, and that we had just gotten our drink at our actual table, and hadn't received it at the bar.  So then she kind of backed off after saying something weird, like, ""Oh, so you just got them?  Oh, okay, then you guys aren't too worried about it then I guess.""  Then she started telling me about the drink I'd received, which wasn't the one that I ordered--it was some other type of vodka with actual fruit in it or something.  Then she gave me a long list of all the other types of fruit vodkas that they have.  I guess that was ok, and the drink ended up being pretty decent.  But it was still just....bizarre. 

Anyway, we ordered our food.  That included a shrimp tempura roll, a squid salad, a regular sized order of the asian nachos, and a buffalo burger.  

The shrimp tempura roll and squid salad came out first.  I'm an idiot who's terrible with chopsticks, and I didn't notice that we had no forks until the waitress was gone.  It took a while to obtain a fork.  But anyhow, the squid salad was pretty decent, typical for any sushi restaurant.  The roll was....ok.  The crab mix in it was kind of like what you could get in a crab salad sandwich at Subway.  It also had carrots in it, which were kind of overwhelming.  

Then, out came the asian nachos.  The gigantic asian nachos.  She brought us a large instead of the regular that I ordered, and of course, charged us for the large.  I considered saying something, but I figured we'd just get a lecture.  We were only able to finish a small portion of them, because the large was freaking huge.  Fortunately they were good.  

Maybe we misread, but the buffalo burger was made with buffalo, not buffalo sauce.  

Moto is not very good."
5,"Cool place, just wish I had been coming here more often.      It's in an old house so it has that cool ""old school downtown"" vibe about it. 

Pretty healthy menu items with funny names that you'll be sure to remember, like Cheech and Dijon Chicken, The Very Brady Clubster,Teriyaki 90210, Gringo Star, In Like Fin, Rocky VII, The Veggie Jackson, and Bird Is The Word , just to name a few.

I had the Prince of Thai which I really enjoyed. Just spicy enough for my tastes. I tried the pasta salad as a side and was impressed that it wasn't oily or had too much useless stuff on it, simple is good.  At $6.95 I thought it was a heck of a lot better than a drive through or a sub sandwich.

I'll be back soon to try one of everything on their menu!"
5,"We love Vin Santo and have gone there about every month or two for 3 years. Small place, warm and inviting, and the lovely host/owner Clarissa greets us like family when we walk in. Her husband/chef makes fabulous and imaginative sauces to accompany the comforting Italian dishes. Their italian sausage is probably the best we've had anywhere (including fancy places in LA, NYC, Philly, etc).

 There are special lasagna, fish, and ravioli dishes every night. The lasagna is cooked to order so it takes a while, but is so worth it. If you are lucky enough to go on an Italian sausage lasagna night, the portion is enormous, and every bite (yes, every bite) includes sausage and cheese - it's the bomb. I had a veal ravioli in a butter sage sauce recently that was fabulous, and unlike some pricey new Italian places where the portion is 5 or so ravioli, this dish had 10 or 12 large ones. In fact, all the portions are large, and really reasonably priced. Their wine selection is pretty sparse, and we haven't had good look finding one we like. But that is the only down side to what is always a fantastic and totally filling meal.  

We are usually too full for dessert, but they do make their own tiramisu, which is light, fluffy, creamy, and enormous. Get one if you have someone to share it with. Recently they have added a couple of desserts, including a caramel cheesecake, which I hope I am not too full to try someday."
1,"I took my mom and grandma to the Beach House last night for dinner thinking it would be better than getting a Papa Murphy's pizza. There weren't many patrons in the dining room. Our waitress was very short with us, demanding our drink orders before taking any questions or orders for our food. I ordered scallops, and when they came to the table they were overcooked, but also cold. It took me at least 15 minutes to find the waitress to ask if I could get warmer food. She said that she would have the kitchen make up a new meal, and about 15 minutes later she returned with my same plate, with my original fork and original food. They scallops were now warm, but lacked flavor, and were even tougher than before. The waitress didn't seem to care about the quality of the food and seemed to be either having a terrible night or was on the influence of something. Needless to say, I will not be returning. On a positive note, the sunset on the lake is pretty."
1,I've left a review before saying that I love this place and they have great service!  Boy did my waiter prove me wrong today!! We had the worst service ever! He was rude and never came to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything! He kept passing by but would never come to our table. I was so disappointed!
1,Its our second time here and they messed up our order both times and the service is horrible.
1,"My wife and I have been talking about checking this place out for years but since we live out of town it's not that easy to just stop in.

Finally we have a chance to check it out last night.... and they're closed for inventory. Judging by the FedEx notices on the door, it's been closed for 3 days. No other info other than a note that says ""Sorry FedEx :("" and a cardboard cutout of a scantily clad woman in the glass doorway that's meant to obscure your view of the inside.

Maybe one of these days we'll see what it looks like on the inside... if it's not still closed for inventory."
1,"WOW!  I have never been to a place with service this horrible.  I may have caught them on a bad night, but I'm not giving them a second chance to find out!

I came in with a group of 4.  We stood up front for 5-10 minutes before waving someone down to be seated.  That was a mistake..

As we're waiting for a server to take our drink order, we noticed that EVERY single table had empty cups waiting to be refilled, dirty plates that needed bussing, and people with impatient faces.  There was only 1-2 dedicated servers, and they completely ignored us.

We stuck around just to see how long it would take before someone took our drink order, it was like being in the Twilight Zone.  After 30 minutes and flagging down 3 employees, we just walked out laughing, no one had even apologized for the wait, I'm not sure they even saw us leave!  It was the strangest restaurant experience of my life.

What a joke...

**EDIT**  To their credit, right after I posted this review, I received a message explaining that the Director of Operations would like to amend the situation, even going so far as to include their cell number.  I admit that I feel strange posting such a negative statement amid all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I'm assuming I caught them on a really bad night.  I'll edit this if I ever return to the restaurant, but the fact that someone actually reached out to try to rectify things says something"
5,"I love this venue.  The symphony is amazing and the staff have great customer service skills.  I have seen a ballet, three symphonies, and the Texas Tenors so far  at this location and I have been pleased each time.  Great place to spend your Saturday night!"
1,"This place sucks.

AJ's already pisses me off for being so ridiculously overpriced, but  this location is dirty and poorly run to top it off. 

Ok, to be honest, it's not THAT dirty or poorly run, but I did once buy a refrigerated package of hummus that already had mold on it. 

I would probably give this place 3 or 4 stars if not for the prices. The prices are just stupid. The beer selection and salad bar are ok, but again, did I mention how maniachally expensive everything is?

I also don't cook a lot. So maybe this place is useful if you cook a lot and you need some ingredient you can't get anywhere else. But in that case, you'd still have to be the Prince of Dubai to be able to afford a lamb chop and a jar of imported chutney (or whatever people who cook put in their food)."
5,"Delicious BBQ from friendly, saucy folk. The brisket was as good as any I've had in Texas and the sauce was sweet, spicy and with a little heat. They also offer a number of tempting sides (you get 2 with most everything on the menu) including a great corn, skin on fries, coleslaw, beans and deep fried biscuits that look and taste like the beignets from New Orleans.  

Parking is limited so you may need to park a block away in the neighborhood and just walk over the restaurant.

Located near the Oscar Mayer factory on Packer road.  Definitely worth a visit.  We will definitely be back when we head back to Madison in the fall."
5,It's unique diner food in a renovated old gas station. They have lots of  vegetarian options and a fantastic bakery!
1,"I don't think there's much to Zen 32 besides looking trendy.

Something seemed strange about the place when I walked in, and after reading other reviews it's been pointed out--the waitresses are wearing Chinese attire with Mandarin collars. I won't hold the lack of authenticity against them. Also, the music is soft and the seating kind of cramped, making for an awkward dining experience.

I'll get the good thing out of the way--the reverse happy hour. The hot ginger sake was overpowering, but for $1 there's no way I can complain. Also, they had a few basic rolls for $3, and that's not too bad. 

Everything else sucks! The specialty rolls are all stuffed with krab, so what hope do you have of ever getting quality sushi? My tootsie roll was garbage, I couldn't taste anything beside the krab inside. The caterpillar roll looked nice, but I could only taste krab and eel sauce. Even the rainbow roll looked promising, and THAT was drenched in sriracha. 

I also had some of this teriyaki chicken entree, and it was rough and a bit dry. The edamame had way too much salt, and I began noticing a pattern to this place. Take crap and season it as much as you can.

I'd like to give this place a second chance for a cheap date or something, but I'm still a little angry at this place (and their sketchy waitress!), for being the first to make me tired of sushi. A friend bought me this meal and I still regret it. It's that bad."
1,"PLEASE, if anyone has recently experienced food poisoning symptoms after visiting this establishment (around June 25-27, 2014) PLEASE CALL: Paola at (602) 506-7171 to report your experience. We do not want anyone else to become ill. 11 people from our party have already become very sick. Thank you."
5,"My bird-eating wife got the chilaquiles last time and I stole some of the meatless parts. Amazing and spicy! Next time we're on Van Buren, I'm asking for chilaquiles plus a fried egg, minus the chicken.

Best thing? Try the potato tacos. That's right. Potato. Tacos. Yum.

La Tolteca is fantastic. Every time I go in, I'm tempted to walk out with a (paid-for) molcajete. Instead, I walk out too-full because I wanted to try so many things."
1,"Of course the Billy Joel Concert on June 1st was super-awesome featuring probably one of the most creative musicians to ever be born on this planet.  Those fingers on the keyboard were nothing but utterly amazing not to mention listening to those great lyrics that he created.  But let's talk about the US Airways Center AND the selling of beverages.  I could understand scamming people into buying a 10.50 beer because you ARE at a concert and that's what you do.  BUT------ BUT-----  $6.00 for a bottle of water??? That is beyond the pale of greed--- People in Phoenix heat NEED water before they dehydrate.  The body in these Phoenix temperatures is in a constant state of dehydration even after being in the arena.  I would pay 3.50 for water still knowing that the greed factor is in play, but realizing that my body (our bodies) need water.  So scam up the beer, the liquor, the food (that's a whole other review), but don't scam the water. Not in PHOENIX."
5,"Lifetime favorite. Restaurant was recently renovated,  added more seating, and updated decor."
1,I must put my 2 cents worth in about Vincents.  I personally will never go to Vincents again.  We went one new year's eve for a friend's husband birthday.  He is French and they are from Florida--so I was trying to make it a special occassion.   I remember very little about the meal because the service was HORRIBLE.  Red wine came after salads had been served.  A white wine sat on our table unopened until we were able to flag someone down--the serving of the meal was uneven at best and then servers got switched mid meal.  For a dinner that cost more than $500--I certainly expected more.  When I called to complain--their offer to me was a glass of champagne and a dessert--to make up for an evening that was suppose to be special on several accounts and turned out to be a disaster.
5,"Maybe I'm jumping the gun with a 5 star review... oh well, life's short.  I tried this place for the first time the other week when my grandparents were visiting me in Madison.  It was just wonderful!

The decor is adorable, the servers were friendly and prompt, and the food was fabulous.  I went with the Heathen Vegan Sandwich, which is piled high with mushrooms, tempeh, and avocado.  For my side, I chose the bean salad.  Both of these items were delicious.  The sandwich was HUGE.  I could not eat it like a regular sandwich, so I ate it in an open-faced sort of way with a fork.  A little messy, but totally worth it.  The mushrooms and tempeh were perfectly seasoned and tender and the avocado brought it all together with the toasted bread.

I got a bit nervous because at the *very last second* my grandma changed her order to the exact same thing I got (she's not vegan) because she ""trusts me"".  I was pretty nervous, but she ended up loving it!  I was so pleased.  My one complaint might be that my bean salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but my grandma's did not share that problem and it wasn't difficult to just eat it with a fork instead of a spoon.

My grandpa ordered some sort of breakfast platter and was very pleased.  He basically always orders the same thing at diners - two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, so if he is impressed I feel that it is a good sign. He said the eggs were cooked perfectly.

They seem extremely accommodating for allergies and preferences as well, which is always a huge plus.

Overall, I was very happy with my first visit to Monty's.   Not only because I loved my vegan options, but because you made my grandparents very happy too and that rocks in my book.  I will definitely be back!"
1,If I could give them a lower score I would. Horrible decline in quality of service. Very low morale of employees leading to poor service. Used to be great and I would go there before any other car wash or other service.
5,"If know about the Welcome Diner, chances are you've heard about it by word of mouth or just stumbled across it by chance. Regardless, this place is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. Everything in the place feel like you stepped into David Lynch's mind while having happy thoughts. The place is super small (8 seats) but that just adds to the authenticity of eating in what might one day be a museum piece of 1950's culture.

The food is incredibly good and surprisingly cheap. If it's the right day, be sure to see if they're making veggie burgers and ask for a float too. The staff is also really chill and make sure that you're satisfied. They offer everything: good food, good atmosphere, and a good experience.

I just wish they had later hours...."
1,"This is for the grooming department.

The customer service here has always been sub par. sometimes we have brought our pup in for a nail trimming and he is done within a couple of minutes, which questions what they're exactly doing if he can be done in a time period that is less than a few minutes.
what completely stopped us from ever going to this alleged ""pet grooming salon"" is one particular miserable female who was going to shave our pup from head to toe due to a couple of matted areas on his body. she never gave advice as to why or what else can be done. obviously that was her plan because it was convenient for her, and not for us. the freaking customer.

please do not support this sad establishment and venture into town a little bit more and go to rufus dumonde pet salon.

p.s. other than the laughable salon and their miserable groomers, the store itself is decent with an excellent selection of food and toys."
5,Carrot cake yogurt with granola - yum!  I got a small and should have gotten a mini cup.  The small was more than ample.  Great flavor and topping choices.
1,"Bedding was stained on pillow and comforter.  Asked front desk to have this changed upon leaving for dinner.  After arriving back at the hotel, bedding had not been changed.  Called front desk and was told that housekeeping was gone for the night.  At check-out I mentioned the issue and was simply verbally told ""Sorry.""

Not acceptable.  My 2nd Mariott stay this year, and I am not giving up my Priority Club Platinum membership to ever try Mariotts again."
5,Some times Jane and Michael Stern are on point and other times the story of the place beats the food.  I would definitely return to the Pine Cone.  It's a bakery and diner attached to a truck stop on the Wisconsin highway.  I live in Chicago and work in a famous Mexican restaurant and I get up to Wisconsin for the old school steak and butter as much as possible: it gives me the energy to do my job.  Pine Cone has eclairs and cream puffs the size of my cat.  And I got a pig cookie.  This little truck stop gives me the big energy to get even deeper into steak and butter territory.
1,"Hot and sour soup had a gallon of vinegar
Mongolian beef had a pound of sugar

Gross, gross, gross.
Thank god we only stopped by while road tripping.. 

Ick

Update: im close to throwing up from that gross taste of sugary (whatever the hell they used in that ""mongolian beef"" sauce). Seriously it was chunks of leathery meat swimming (really) in gross brown syrupy sauce. With several pathetic pieces of onions. Thats it, folks. Thats mongolian beef for the ghetto house of hong kong.  This is not chinese food. No, this should not even be food."
1,"I am not sure why people like this place.  I have tried several locations and have dis-liked them all.  If I don't like a place I don't usually give it a second chance but  because I like to support local businesses and so many people rave about Macayo's I did try several locations.  Everyone says the one off of Mill Ave is good.  But I have wasted enough money at their restaurants.  It boggles my mind how a chain of such low quality can exist.  Any one of the numerous Mexican restaurants usually ending with ""o's"" is better than this place.  

The reason they have big margarita's is to distract you from the horrible food and hope after you get over your hangover the margarita is all you remember. Everything I have tasted is bland and seems like it came out of a can.  This chain helps perpetuate the stereotype of Mexican food being of low quality.  I am Mexican-American and used to changing people's mindset when I have them over for dinner.

The only nice quality of this location is the building is unique it looks like a mesoamerican  pyramid."
1,"Everything that is wrong with chain restaurants. First clue: robotically cheerful drones wearing baseball hats and headsets to greet you. Next: table buried under menus, special offer flyers, rewards card app, etc.  Then: food choices. I have nothing against red meat. Love burgers. But if you want to know why America has become the most obese country look no further. Unlimited fries with every sandwich? Really?  Bottomless rootbeer float. Oink oink. There is enough sodium in this food to melt the January ice on Lake Monona."
5,"I've always meant to order from  here, but I used to go to New Orleans so often that it's never been pressing issue. Finally, one day the cravings got to us, so we tried the place out.

The place was exceptionally easy to order from. They don't play 1,000 questions with you, which is nice. The menu is easy to find online if you don't have a paper copy. 

I admit, when I picked up our order and got it home, we were slightly dismayed at the quantity. We ordered two dishes for three people. We spend a lot of time in the Big Easy and have become accustomed to ordering from the locals' joints which cater to the service people. Large portions, cheap prices. 

Then we tasted it. We had the large trio (combination of a few things) and it was so good -- the flavors were great, the stuff was actually spicy, and I found I could love jambalaya (normally not a fan).  We also go a shrimp po'boy -- I was so excited that it tasted almost exactly at the one we get from our normal go-to place in the Quarter. 

While the quantity was less than we expected, the quality was superior to what we get at our little dive joints. You can definitely see they emphasize flavor and texture, rather than giving you a week's worth of food. That works for me -- we were all full off our dishes and very happy."
1,"DOWNHILL.  I've been eating at Luke's a few times a month since 1996.  Over the last few years, It's slowly been going downhill.  Their signature Italian Beef sandwiches are often served barely warm or cold.  The extremely hard crusted french bread used to be dipped in au ju (gravy) to soften them up and load the sandwich with flavor.  Now, no matter how you order it (extra gravy, wet, etc.) the sandwich comes out almost completely dry and is guaranteed to destroy the roof of your mouth.

I'm really disappointed to see a restaurant I've had so many good lunches wither away, but even their health inspections have made dining here risky at best.  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=11712&business=LUKE'S%20RESTAURANT&address=1602%20%20%20E%20%20INDIAN%20SCHOOL%20RD&permitid=SG13198

All this and their prices have been skyrocketing!  Save your money and your health and go somewhere else."
5,"Having dined at the Welcome Diner every week since Payton's arrival, I felt it was finally time to let yelpland know about my experiences. 

Also having been a fan of Digestif and Caffe Boa, during Patyon's residency, this is his best work, yet. I am floored by Payton's creativity and fresh-style every time I'm at the Welcome Diner.

I haven't had anything yet that left me wanting more. Each dish is well thought out and perfectly executed. Payton manages to capture the purity and freshness of the ingredients that so many chefs in town manage to murder. 

As excited as I am to have Payton around the corner from my house, I am even more excited and anxious to see what his next spot will deliver. It's only going up from here folks and if your not on the Curry train yet, get on. 

If you're one of those people who enjoys bland food and thinks that every restaurant needs a nice view, please stay out of our neighborhood and stop yelping about how Noca is in a strip mall. Phoenix is on it's way to being regarded as one of the top cities for dining and those narrow minded opinions are no longer welcome."
5,Best BBQ sandwiches in Phoenix.  The BBQ sauce is amazing.  I generally get the chicken sandwiches but my friends all swear by the pork.
1,"I've been here two different times, Once for a haircut and shave, another time for a ""trim"". The first time the haircut was great, however after the straight shave my neck bled for days on end and looked like I had been mauled by a bear. You would have thought that was warning enough to stay away but after a few months I decided to go get a neck trim. Bad Idea. Apparently when you tell someone your growing your hair out and to leave the top and sides alone, In Russian it mean to cut EVERYTHING and leave it a little longer than normal. Then when you do ask for it to be fixed they talk crap about you in Russian. Bad Business. I should have spend the extra time and gas driving to my regular barber at 19th and greenway."
1,I found them to be very unprofessional.  I will not use them ever again.
5,"This tiny museum is so cute and has a ton of artifacts!  Its free so thays a bonus and in walking distance from Union South. The dinosaurs, giant armidillo,  and mammoth are super to see and are quite rare so its splendid to see in Madison. If you have a few free minutes are youre close by, this is a great FREE time killer."
5,"Visited again recently.  This time I had the beef burrito.  Oh...my...god...it was GOOD!  Very good seasoning, Unlike my chicken chimi last time, no need to add anything to the beef burrito!

Also ordered was a pork (carnitas) burrito.  Use the green salsa from the salsa bar and it becomes really good too!

And we took tamales home.  Can you guess?  Yeah...they were really good!!

It's almost enough to make me wish I lived downtown."
1,"Absolute worst wings I've ever had, I'm 43, may be the first time I've ever asked for my money back. Soggy, and no sauce."
1,"Boy have they really gone downhill.  Tellers are still nice, but now they have ticky tack fees for everything just like you'd expect at a big bank.  And, paying a fee just for checking is not something I expect from a credit union, especially when there are banks out there now that offer TOTALLY FREE  CHECKING (Washington Federal, First Bank and my favorite Bank of Arizona to name a few.) Also, some of the more personalized services they used to offer, they just don't anymore (calling you with issues on the account, etc.) so why bank with a credit union (which has more limitations) when there are no additional benefits?  That's why I left."
5,"I love that I have a slice of Mexico in walking distance from my apartment.  I always get the exact same thing at La Tolteca.  Chicken enchiladas with rice and beans.  Green sauce.  No lettuce.  With a side of the tomatillo salsa.  I should probably try something nice, but if it ain't broke, then why try and fix it.

What's great about La Tolteca is that it is a to go place, a sit down restaurant, and a bakery.  It's festive and inviting inside even if the Van Buren surroundings sometimes aren't.  

So to summarize: authentic, affordable and delicious Mexican food."
5,"I love Culver's. This is fact.

The thing that makes this Culver's different from the rest is that they had offered Wisconsin-fare, i.e. Wisconsin Cheese Soup. Wow, was this fantastic! The facility was clean, the employees were very happy and the food was very tasty!

I'm glad that I can find quality fast-food, yet sit-down food across the nation!"
1,"Drea, thanks for posting your experience! I completely understand, as I had a very similar experience! I went this morning to use a $10 certificate that I had purchased for $4 through a daily deal.  I usually love discovering new places this way because it gives you a chance to spend less money at a new place and decide if you like it or not. And I've made the assumption that owners are happy to see customers with a coupon because it means the marketing they chose worked and new people are coming in.  You would THINK they would want to make a good first impression. But not the Coffee Lady! I came in and ordered an egg salad sandwich. She went to her fridge to get some egg salad and said ""The tuna and chicken are a lot more filling if you want that, but we are famous for our egg salad.""  I wasn't sure if she wanted me to change my order, or if she was just making conversation, but it seemed like an odd statement to me and I started doubting my order, but I didn't say anything.  The next thing I heard was ""Ah, this is kind of skimpy, let me add another egg.""  And when I looked over, I could see that the container she had pulled out with egg salad was nearly empty, which clearly meant she was using yesterday's leftovers (as it was 8 in the morning when I came in), and I was a bit disappointed that the egg salad isn't made fresh daily. She literally peeled and added an egg right into what was left. I was just surprised at how nonchalant she was. Then I ordered a latte, since I knew I had to use up my $10. The latte was good (nothing out of the ordinary) and she was very friendly to me while making my drink. But then it came time to pay...and when I pulled out my coupon she said ""Oh, one of THOSE....great, I have to start my day off with one of those, huh?"" WOW! Talk about poor customer service. If you don't want to get new customers into your store at a discount, then why did you agree to the deal???  Her attitude was a total turn off...So then she added up my two items and said ""OK, you're just under $10 but you do have to pay tax, which is $.84 and that doesn't include a tip either, if you care.""  (and this was as I was putting a cash tip in her jar, which she did NOT deserve, and I kicked myself for doing that, though CLEARLY she is hurting if she's that upset that I'm using a coupon, and VOICING that it doesn't include the tip). Then she had the gull to inquire if I lived nearby because she wanted me as a return customer. UNBELIEVABLE. I will NEVER go to this place again. Even if they HAD the best egg salad sandwiches or coffee in town, which they DON'T (and wouldn't you know, I ended up with an egg shell in my sandwich), I wouldn't go back.  
I do not like to be negative and truly do have better things to do with my time, but I don't appreciate being treated badly or differently for trying a new place on a budget."
1,"Cheese sticks were under cooked, the pizza was EXTREMELY greasy.  I mean, oil was literally dripping out of the crust. Gross. It also had kind of a funky aftertaste. Wings were okay. 

With so many options for good pizza in town, there is pretty much no reason to eat at pizza hut, even if it does save you a few bucks. Boo-urns."
5,"Dr. Killian is our family's favorite dentist, including my husband the dentalphobe, and our two young daughters. We appreciate the beautiful facility, private rooms, gentle hygienists and top notch dental care."
5,"Showed up last night (Thursday) for the line dancing lessons with Chandelle and was blown away.

Why I loved this spot:
- the bartender was SUPER FRIENDLY (and rocked a silver fox sign over her bar)
- Chandelle is an AWESOME teacher, she really made the line dancing lessons fun and engaging 
- the people at the bar were very warm and welcoming, a few people talked to me directly (many of you know this is not the norm in many cities)

Please note: when you first arrive, the exterior is nothing to get excited about but not to fear, once you enter... well, it is a standard country bar."
5,"Olbrich is a true gem in Madison. I looks like it belongs somewhere exotic and elite with a golden Thai temple (yes, REAL gold and REAL Thai) and a stunning rose garden. 

The indoor botanical garden is stunning, and there is a fun self-guided scavenger hunt that is entertaining for kids and adults.

They have really great events and yoga in the park, which I have been to and love. This is my favorite place to take people from out of town that has nothing to do with food."
5,"Solid 5. Totally chill attitude from the guys behind the counter serving up killer food. To start: an Old Fashion for me and a Candy Corn signature for the wife. We split not one but two orders of the bacon and cheese fries, and had the biscuit w chicken, gravy, and bacon. All fantastic. Go here anytime if you got a hankering for comfort food after a hangover or just because. We'll be back soon. And we're bringing friends."
1,"This does not exist.  It is now an unbelieveably soulless gay bar with the inventive name ""Bar One"".  That is all."
5,"I haven't been to Zoe's for probably a year but I always love it when I come! As I typically do, I recently had the grilled chicken plate which is grilled chicken with sauteed onions, and your choice of a side (I chose their rice-yummy) and their greek salad. The salad is always huge so I usually save it for its own meal later. Their salad comes with their signature vinaigrette which is soooooo good. We also got a pre-packaged side of their red potato salad which is good, itself, but I like to put the dressing on it, too. My husband got the tuna pita and thought it was awesome. My brother went for the mediterranean pita and raved about it, too. The food is fresh and you feel you are eating healthy. The prices are average for most places, nowadays and I think the grilled chicken plate at approx $7 is a pretty good deal when you can make two meals out of it. Oh yeah, their fountain lemonade was out when I went but my husband recommended I try their freshly squeezed limeade behind the counter. I am a huge fan of limes and this was absolutely delicious. Not too tart or too sweet, just perfect. Love, love, love Zoes."
5,"This place has saved me from dry nights on numerous occasions. The sign faintly resembles one of a Harley Davidson merch shop, but upon entry, your greeted with plenty of boozin' options. The vodka assortment is also pretty top notch. I've managed to score some unique domestics and imports. I've often been confused by the age of some of their patrons, but then I remember that this is also a bait shop, and that there is a rare few of today's use that actually go fishing. Ew... worms.

Anyway, the location of this place is another reason I'll continue to visit. For those who haven't been to Madison, 9 PM is when alcohol sales come to a screeching holt. If you're hanging out on the east side, the clock strikes 8:45, and you've realized that you started to sweat because you don't know if you can make it down Willy St. in time on a Friday night, don't worry. Just head a bit more east. 

Harley's may be a little out of the way of the party sector, but you're guaranteed a traffic-free, open road, complete with the freedom to change lanes. You'll have no problems getting here fast enough that you won't turn into a pumpkin."

1,"One of the few places in the area that will deliver.  I thought I would give it a shot.  I ordered a #2 12inch and a large coke.  With a 10% off coupon I had, the total was around $13.50 with tip everything came out to $16.00.  I begin thinking to myself, ""With a Subway and Dilly's Deli next to this place, they better step it up.""  They said it would take 45 minutes... no problem.  The sandwich came early... great!

The hot sandwich I ordered was cold and the bottom bread was totally soggy.  My biggest peeve in this world is soggy bread.  The quality of ham is disgusting.  It's slimy and tastes like ham flavoring.  I am not a ham snob by any means, but this is not edible.   For a sandwich that costs this much, they need to use better product.  I was starving when I ordered it.  I ate a few bites and now it's going in the trash.  

I predict that this place won't make it through the summer.  In the summer this place will have to rely on all the local business employees.  People like me who would order food everyday from the same place (if it's good) are the people they will have to rely on.  I know people in my office will never call this place again because they were grossed out by my sandwich and baffled by how much I spent on it.  

I get a limited time to eat lunch...I don't have time to call and complain, have them remake it and try to eat it again.  I'll pretend I just drank a $16.00 soda."
5,"Amazing Mexican food!! If you're in the mood for great Mexican food, look nowhere else. Chips and salsa are nice and spicy. Plus, this place is in the hood so that in itself enhanced my experience."
5,"I love this place!  The food is ALWAYS fabulous and healthy.  The art on the walls is changed out monthly and the staff always friendly.  A great place to chill with a book or the New Times over lunch, they are not open for dinner.  The Prince of Thai's Wrap, is the best and the pasta salad is the best I have ever had.  No mayo !  Also, you can get a ""frequesnt visitor"" card and after 9 meals get the 10th one free, which trust me, does not take long!  5 stars, always :)"
1,"I just resigned my lease earlier this month for another year. I really regret my decision to stay. In the year I have lived here I have had nothing but problems mostly with maintenance but lately with the leasing office. I've had maintenance in my apartment without permission and without living notice they were even there or that they fixed the problem. With the leasing office the lost one of my money orders from June and beginning of October I was made aware of a past due amount on my account. When the leasing office confirmed they did not cash that money order I was told I had to pay to retrieve my money and I was only offered sorry this was a mistake made from previous management. This place could care less about their residents, they have no clue how to run their office and the people who work there are constantly changing therefore no one knows what to do. I would never recommend this as a place to live to anyone."
5,"Dear Monty's,

I miss you so, so much out here in Boston. We've had quite the long-term relationship: from late-night pie after high school dances, to my stint as a busgirl/counter in the ever-important Sunday brunch rush, your old blue tshirts with ""World's Best Coffee"" on the back, to dinner before a show at the Barrymore, to my going back each time I'm in town to run into familiar faces. 

For years, Tim and Roma and a large posse have made this tiny former gas station a stalwart in the Madison dining scene. Monty's, you and the Barrymore have rejuvenated Atwood Ave. You, and your vegetarian comfort food, zucchini-potato pancakes, scrambled something-or-other, andes mint cheesecake, chocolate malts (don't ask how much ice cream goes into those, btw. but it's all from the Chocolate Shoppe), muffins, pumpkin bars. I could go on and on. And how. 

For all of you lucky enough to reside around this place, please take advantage. There's nothing like it anywhere else.

Sincerely,
Angelina"
5,Love this
1,"A buddy of mine wanted to go to brunch on Saturday. He suggested the PCG. I had never been, but had heard about it and wanted to try it. We got there about noon and the hostess sat us at table in the middle of the dining room. I looked over and the bar  was empty so we opted to move in there. First of all, the menu is eclectic. Check it out and you will see what I mean. I wanted brunch and this was not your typical brunch menu. The batender was great. He took a moment and gave us the lowdown on the menu. We both order and off he went. I ordered Carne asado tacos and my buddy ordered a burger with no bun. 30 minutes?? Really???? I was so hungry by the time the food got to our table that I would not have cared if it was cat food. I would have eaten it. Unfortunately, that's kinda what my tacos tasted like. $30 for two people for brunch. I got 2 tacos and an iced tea. No, I will not be back."
5,"Great place for old school Wisconsin supper club dining. Lots of food, small prices. No need for an appetizer when ordering entrees as they come with bread, cinnamon rolls, and relish tray. Great place!"
1,"BBQ Sauce is spectacular.  But the restaurant is horrible -- uncomfortable dining room, prices way too high to be a no-service, order at the counter place, sides are minuscule in tiny cups, and there's no bar, not even beer!  What's BBQ without beer to go with it?  

Prices are way over the top for Madison.

Stop by for some takeout pulled pork, or buy a bottle of exceptional BBQ sauce and do it yourself at home."
1,"Our reservation was set for 7:30pm on a Saturday, we arrived to a nearly empty establishment with outdated décor and senior citizen to match. That should've been red flag number one. We waited at the entrance for a few moments before we were greeted by whom I guess was the owner. He said he had been expecting us, sat us at our table and disappeared for the remainder of the evening.  Our waiter was odd; he seemed to be in a rush and irritated even though the place was empty. For starters we ordered the pasta trio sampler and the Oyster Rockefeller.  The only thing memorable about the sampler was the gnocchi which was as good as most yelpers mentioned. The Rockefeller may have been the worse I've ever had; the oysters were so tiny I could barely discern them in the heavily creamed spinach. I'm not sure how something so creamy can be so utterly bland and flat. For the entrée I had the Salmon which again was drowned in a weird sauce that covered the entire plate. The salmon was moist but the sauce was putrid. It tasted at least 3 days old. The sides were cold oven roasted potatoes which again were covered in that odd sauce. For the finale, I tried the Crème Brulee, again that was a mistake. It was ice cold and had chunks of pineapples in it which is not normal nor was it ever mentioned. The top of the brulee was not properly browned and didn't crack when my spoon hit it. I look forward to cracking my Crème Brulee, darn! Needless to say I will never be back here again."
1,"Stay as far away as you can from this place.  I have been twice and both times both of our entrees were cold.  The last time I came I should have known I was going to have a bad experience by the fact that the kitchen manager and floor manager were chit chatting on the floor the entire time I was there.  I ordered the Breast of Chicken Fettuccine.  It was possibly the worst pasta dish I have ever had.  The chicken was so dry I could not eat it.  It tasted like it was either boiled, reheated or a little of both.  The cold stale pasta and sauce did little to compliment it, so I picked the broccoli out and that was that.  I wonder how they are teaching servers nowadays because when I was still in the industry and two plates looked untouched we were taught to inquire about what was wrong.  I did not feel the need to complain because as I stated before the manager was obviously too busy hanging out nonchalantly to care about my awful dish.  I would stay away unless you are just of the greedy type that don't mind stale pasta because they will give you a heaping serving for around $10."
1,"I am honestly shocked by the good reviews but I guess I am glad others have a better experience here.

Hadn't been to this location in over 3 years due to mediocre service and food. Went today to see if anything has changed. Nope.

Gave us tots instead of fries. Made the Slush Floats were ordered weird... it's suppose to be a slush with ice cream inside UNBLENDED. If this is how they make them now... um... alright. They did not add my mom's petezel dog despite telling them the order repeatedly and when we pushed the button to correct this we were met with nothing but some rude guy. Pretzel dogs with bacon and cheese are suppose to have bacon bits. They gave us a big ole slice of bacon across the dog. Makes it harder to eat. Why I am not surprised that they are too lazy to cut up the bacon slices like in the picture.

Goodbye forever, Sonic."
1,"So this first experience started off with a huge cockroach in the bathroom. Almost couldn't even sit down to go. (yuck) ok on to the rest. The chips and salsa were good with a little bit of spice. The Numero 15 is a cheese enchilada with a chicken taco rice and beans. The only flavor at this restaurant was in the salsa. It was so bland. I don't know that it was worth the $3 parking validation we came for. My friend and I love Mexican so we picked it on our way elsewhere, my suggestion go elsewhere."
5,"This is the kind of place that I would visit all the time if I lived nearby. The concept is solid (order what you want and it's written on your brown paper bag, and you pay when they call your name). I chose the spinach salad, which was great quality bacon, feta, and sundried tomatoes on a bed of spinach with a creamy mustard poppy dressing. People were so friendly here, that's what really made it worth it. There were plenty of tables available at noon on a weekday."
5,"Power yoga class today. 
What great way to detox your body and find all the muscles and balance points you rarely use (you'll find them the hard way, BTW, but that's another story).
As I was lying on the mat at the end of the class, listening to Max (our instructor/Chief Yogi), telling us to just be and to try to not think...try not to eat or drink for an hour after the session and just let our bodies detox, all I could think of was ""what can I eat to retox as quickly as possible, that won't kill me where I stand?""
Not an easy question to ponder, even with the existential power of yoga still pulsating through every fiber of my being...a chili dog from Ted's or Long Wong's?; an Italian Beef  from Luke's; Chicken and waffles from Lolo's?
And then it hit me, almost causing me to stir from my yoga induced coma, Taco's de Juarez!!!!!
As anyone who has read even one of my reviews will tell you, I am a ""Trendinista"" of the first order. 
I follow the herd, make no mistake about it! 
Why?
Because, occasionally, the herd knows where it's going...and this is one of those very special occasions!
I had spotted this place before...on my way by at high speed, to get to Welcome Diner for a burger.
But since I wasn't packing, I never, ever stopped rolling, let alone got out of my car here. 
Yelp changed all that. This place has some terrific reviews, in spite of the fact that there isn't a Betos or Bertos in sight. 
Worth a try, right?
Taco's of Juarez is a delightfully dirty little gem...the proverbial diamond in a goat's ass. 
I sat down and the sweet little non-english speaking waitress brought chips and salsa...The Two Grinders (Los Dos Molino's) need to take salsa lessons from these folks...some of the best salsa I have had (the salsa verde is definitely the best I've had in the US...makes me long for couple of places along the beach in Bahia de Navidad).
In an effort to retox as quickly as possible, I ordered the number 16 lunch especial...a shredded beef gordita (""gordita"" means ""meat wrapped in lard, then deep-fried"" in Spanish) and a cerveza (ice, ice cold BTW).
Freakishly good...I know, it was almost pure lard that had been heated to point where it lost its molecular cohesion and liquefied...but it was damn tasty lard. I forked a little salsa chile and salsa verde onto the gordita (accompanied by refritos and rico) and dug in.
I awoke to shouts of ""clear"" as the feverish paramedics worked to restart my heart...just kidding! 
I am fine:) !!
So, go to the pawn shop and find yourself a nice little Sig Sauer 9mm pistol and holster, turn on the car alarm and go try Taco's of Juarez. Possibly the best Mexican food in town!
And now, another one on my list of favorite places to retox after I've detoxed!"
5,"You have NEVER tried mexican food till you've had it here (and I've been to mexico several times)....and if your gonna come and order tacos - then just go to taco bell!

The menu is extensive, I've tried EVERYTHING from tongue to intestines and I am SOOO not ""that"" kind of eater!  Delish each and every time! The wait staff is helpful and some of them have been there for years (speaks heavily on the quality of management...they must be as good to their workers as they are to their customers). 

You will not be disappointed....if you go for breakfast, you have to try the Machaca Chiliquilies......unforgettable!"
1,"Soooo disappointed - been going here for years for the guacamole salsa, and tonight we find it's no longer there.  On top of that, the shrimp burro which is my all-time favorite now comes full of green and red peppers and onions and very few shrimp.  The menu does not say anything about green and red peppers, and when we went back up to the counter, we were told the menu has changed even though the changes are not noted on the posted menu and they weren't happy that we didn't like the changes.  After all these years of going there - not again!!!!!"
1,"I work around the corner and go here sometimes for a quick lunch. I've never had a problem here until today. I walk in, order my flat bread, sit down and BAM! In my sandwich is a HUGE grasshopper just jammed in there with the head popping out! I didn't freak out outwardly just calmly walked over to the cashier and showed her my sandwich. She joked that it's just a ""little extra protein"" but would make me a new sandwich. News flash...this is AMERICA, nobody wants to eat that kind of ""protein"" at Subway! My stomach is still hurting from the sight and for my trouble was offered ""2 free cookies"". Great, thanks. All in all, I will never come back and probably would never eat at Subway again!"
1,"I spent the better part of seven years of my life as an automotive technician at a fairly large (20+ techs) dealership, and as such fully and completely appreciate the expertise, knowledge, and service that a dealership provides.

Whenever possible, I purchase parts and services from local dealerships.  Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  

That said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.

I called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta.  My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (""PD"" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor.  Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.

So imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use ""any old oil"" while on the phone.  When I tried to correct him and request the 505.01 Castrol VW oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved.

I then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my VW on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter.  I then gave him my VIN, and he was still confused.  A few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what I would pay from any other online VW parts dealer.

So, I declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership.  I'm sorry, but my confidence was shaken immediately, and I was floored by the sky high price (they quoted $60 for the filter; everyone else is $25)."
5,"Authentic Indian in Madison, Wisconsin.  Score!"
5,"They remembered I ordered the Gruben every time I come here, impressive"
1,"If you've ever been to New Orleans and have therefore been spoiled by actual cajun food, this place is a guaranteed disappointment. My $12 shrimp po'boy had maybe 10 shrimp on it, something that is supposed to be a staple of cajun cuisine. The couple of small pickles, half of a tomato slice and soggy lettuce given as dressings for the sandwich were an embarrassment. I'm not sure what flavor the chips were, because there was no flavor. I think I could have had better at Long John Silver's, and I hate Long John Silver's."
5,"I love this place.  I love the ambiance, the food, and the drinks.  It's even better when they have a lounge singer in the background."
5,"Sounds of stirring, lunch
nears and my appetite waits
my neighbor enters.

Quick we drive to it
A simple place but look-busy!
Still no wait to sit.

Varied menu greets us
I choose the daily special
Food like its home-made.

Service is friendly.
Order comes quickly to you,
Owners always smile.

Soon it's time to go
my thoughts turn food away, but look
my wallet not empty."
1,"I don't usually come on Yelp to write explicitly negative reviews, but my experience at this dealership was so poor that I feel I need some sort of recourse, with a review seeming to be the most reasonable option. Please note that the problem was with the service department and I know nothing about the sales at this dealership. Now, I know better than to have service done at a dealership for the most part, but my only problem was a dead turn signal, which I figured would be a quick job; my old Hyundai used to take about 5 minutes and cost $3 for parts. I came in last week and the place was swamped, so it was recommended that I make an appointment and return. I did so for today, calling in the morning for a 1:30 appointment. When I showed up, I was told it would take about 2 hours because they were getting backed up, this despite the fact I had called ahead. When I repeated this fact, the manager-who seemed like he could not care less about my business on either occasion-said we could ""move things around"" to speed it up. In all I spent close to 1.5 hours there and my bill was $90 for a $5 part and maybe 20 minutes with of labor, as they need to disassemble an area to get to the bulb. By far the worst experience I've had with any car service and I would not return there with my business."
5,"Van Gogh Alive...amazing!  This was such a great way to view Van Gogh's art and be immersed in the music of that time.  $25 is a lot for an art exhibit, but upon leaving I felt it was entirely worth it.  I hope this is a trend to view other artist's work."
1,"So I came on here to ""Rag on Red."" Looks like a LOT of people beat me to it. After having a great brunch at St. Francis across the parking lot, my boyfriend and I decided to take a peek in. 

Well, first of all, I wasn't sure there was anyone there for a while. Which was fine, we just kept looking around and being goofy looking at all the cool old stuff that they have to offer. As we made our way through the store I found who I could only make out as a sales man sitting in front of some lady on a computer. 

They bothered themselves to greet us at that point. Never getting out of their seats at any point of our visit. (I've worked my way through college/law school doing retail, big no-no not greeting customers and making them feel un-welcomed).

Soooo... I was mindlessly walking around the furniture portion of the store when.......GASSSSSPPPP! I tapped on some of the furniture with my finger nail!!! You would have though I had taken a hammer to it with their reaction. I was admiring their selection and not reading all the little signs about not touching anything. Whatever.

I was annoyed with them not wanting me to touch anything but alas, its their store, if they don't want people to enjoy their products that's their business. 

What blew my top was when my boyfriend (who is very friendly and is always interested in what a business has to offer) asked them a question about a chair. An Egg Chair. You would have thought he sounded like a babbling idiot because their answers where so pretentious and condescending. He asked about other things they had in the store and they had the same cold attitude everyone else on here talks about.  

Anyway, I'm assuming that the majority of the their actual customers come from web sales because there is no way anyone I know would spend that kind of money on furniture when the sales staff is acting like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to breath in their precious vintage air."
5,"Been going here for years, but just made a big run as we have a new pup.   The prices are absolutely terrific."
1,"I would much rather write a positive review than a negative one, but my experience here was beyond unacceptable, so I felt I had the responsibility to report. 
I recently rented a lawn mower from this store. The employe I dealt with told me the $75 deposit would be refunded with cash upon return. 
I returned to find a different employe who informed me that the policy was actually refunding my card at days end. 
I explained that I was told differently, he offered neither apology nor explanation, just told me to check back tomorrow. 
No refund the next day. No refund the day after. In the meantime, I had a returned check at my bank due to funds not being there (thanks HD) and incurred a $35 fee. So I returned, was given the run around and demanded a manager. This guy was worse than his employees! Told me ""if you can't afford the deposit, maybe you should rent elsewhere!"" He then promised to refund my card that day and I left. Well well well, imagine my surprise when checking my account the next morning, I discovered not a credit, but another $75 charge! And with this, another $35 back fee! 
Needless to say, I angrily returned to speak with the HD manager, and he rudely informed me it was out of his hands and I had to call corporate headquarters. Thanks to the fraud department at my bank, I finally got my money back, but it took 4 weeks, and $70 in bank fees. The initial cost of rental was great, but due to misinformed employees and a careless manager, the experience cost me $70 extra, countless hours of my life, and a world of frustration. I have nothing positive to say about this place, and highly encourage anyone renting equipment to go anywhere else for higher quality products and customer service that would surely dwarf that of Home Depot"
5,"I'm basically an upbeat positive person...but some days I'm not my normal corky self. I arrived at Perry Monge flumoxed and in a bad mood--a special event meant that all nearby lots cost $12 for parking. Spending $12 for parking is spendy for a day in San Francisco...but in Phoenix for an hour? Please. I mentioned this to the poised woman at the check-in desk who said that next time I should park in the lot at their building where they validated parking. She then brough out a yummy iced tea for me to sip while filling out the new client form. I went to the bathroom, which featured a delightful scented candle, and then Sandy (?) brought me to the changing room and then my chair. A surprise: shortly after sitting down in the barber chair a woman brought me over to have my shampoo--and gave me a brief massage first. The massage/shampoo woman had a very positive energy to her. Marina cut my hair and, although she was not much of a talker, was upbeat and gave me a great cut. I've been looking for a great place in Phoenix and found it. No one will ever compare to my beloved Cid at Barbarella in San Francisco, but I do have a new favorite salon locally in the Valley of the Sun."
1,"Convenience was the only factor when choosing to come here for past car washes and, most recently, an oil change. There's something overwhelming about the amount of people that swarm your car the minute you pull up and repeatedly try to sell you additional services without your solicitation. 

One of the employees asked for my phone number and I asked why he needed it. ""In case we have to up-sell you or return your car,"" was his response. Reluctantly I gave it and sure enough I received a call while I was grocery shopping and waiting. The employee asked me if I wanted additional services after I already said no. I insisted ""no"" and he still persisted. Very frustrating.

After the carwash, there was oil all over the inside of my car and I had to ask the employee to wipe the writing off my windshield which obstructed my view. 

I will drive the distance for a better place in the future. Convenience is no longer worth the compromised service."
5,I visited Phoenix a few years ago for a gig (coming from LA). Had another musician friend who lived there turn me on to this place - awesome! Love the food and the divey ambience. If you're looking for fancy go somewhere else. If you're looking for authentic quality food this is the place. Absolutely delicious and I remember it still after 5+ years.
5,"The only reason that I do not shop more at Ranch Market is because of the distance.  Now that I have that out of the way...

Ranch Market is my favorite supermarket.  It is nothing but a fun experience everytime I go.  They have a vast selection of food, a great source of produce, and the best food that has ever been served in a grocery store. 

Sometimes, I go 15 miles out of my way, just to have some of their Carnitas tacos.  They are to die for!  Fresh meat, fresh tortillas, and a large selection of fabulous salsas makes for an incredibly delicious lunch.

Make sure you go over to the drink station and try some of their Horchata.  Horchata is a drink made out of almonds and rice... It is creamy and delicious.  If you are looking for something sweet, then go with their Hibiscus.  It will literally melt in your mouth.

Everyone who lives in Metro Phoenix needs to go to this place.  It's a true treat!"
5,"This has been my car wash since I lived in midtown off 3rd street and Thomas. They do a great job, and are very accommodating if they miss a spot. They tend to be somewhat expensive, but then again they are not scratching your car with machines. I used to get the side wash with my Audi because of some modifactions that kept it from being on the rails, and for $15 you couldn't get a better wash in town. 

I don't recommend their detail service, as they are not very complete, but for car washes A+"
5,"Just went here last night for the first time after a visit to the museum, and it was everything I had heard and more - i was not disappointed.

beautiful historic home turned upscale-casual restaurant, in the style of Coup de Tartes or House of Tricks. It was relatively busy, but we were sat right away.

Mom had the BBQ chicken, BF had pork tenderloin (I'm not a pork fan usually, but this was melt in your mouth delicious and not overly salty at all) and i had the meatloaf entree (not sandwich, as advised by the young and very pleasant server).

we were all very pleased with our orders and service was prompt, professional and pleasant. the woman dining next to us came as a recommendation while in town from the owner and chef's cousin. she asked the server to let him know she was here so she could meet him and say hi, and after the crowd died down a bit, he did and seemed like super cool, down to earth guy.

i overheard him mention his ""other restaurant"" so on our way out i asked him about it. he was also super friendly with me and filled me in on Circa 1900 (which I've also heard lots of good stuff about). i will be heading there on my next dining adventure.

dinner entrees were priced between $15 to $25, cheapest glass of wine was $6 (not bad, the food was couturely presented and tasty).

p.s. the parking lot was a nightmare... all dirt and full of HUGE pits and deep tire tracks, but wouldn;t stop me from returning"
5,"I don't care about ""ambiance"" or ""decor"" anymore.  I hit 40 and it doesn't matter to me anymore.

I am more concerned about food.

This food is awesome.

Go, it is incredible."
5,"Love this place. Gets crowded around the normal brunch time, so go early or go late. Otherwise, it's probably going to be at least a 30 minute wait.

Huge portions. Love their omelets. Lots of vegetarian options (if that's your thing - not mine). Haven't tried their desserts, but they always look tasty.

Service: Good. I've always had very nice servers. And I'm willing to cut them slack since they're always really busy. Plus they're pretty quick with the coffee refills.
Environment: Old school diner feel - with booths and stools! Doesn't feel cramped even when it gets crowded.

Side notes: I LOVE diners. Also, if you eat the biscuit, you're a fatty."
1,"I don't know what happen to Hooters? My roommate in college use to work for one in Houston so I have frequent Hooters a time or hundred in my life. The quality of the product has no integrity it is so nasty, the wings are never fried correctly they come out bloody and under sauced. I just want some wings once in a while with breading.  iIt is difficult to find."
1,"Ate there last night with a group of friends.  The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night.  I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.  The fries that went along with it were also extremely salty.  A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back.  I was quite bummed about this."
1,"Update 9/25/07 - Received a phone call from a salon manager today.  The $85 I spent to get my haircut corrected (not to mention the time) will not be reimbursed.  She stated over and over again how they offer a 100% guarantee...apparently not.  She just didn't understand why I wasn't willing to risk yet another haircut with them.  I told her I just didn't have faith in their services.  I don't think you should either...

Update 9/20/07 - I got another cut and color in August.  Color was wonderful as always.  Cut was atrocious.  It was kinda in the $8 super cuts range.  I hardly trusted them to give it another go.  If you did this once, why would I let you take scissors up again?  So, I headed to Rolf's and $85 later, I had a real haircut and style.  Sent a letter to the management of the salon...still waiting to hear back from them..."
5,"Just went here based on some lovely yelpers reviews and you did not let me down! Wow the food was so good, and the owner/staff were very pleasant.

I just got 3 bean and cheese stuffed corn tortillas, rice and more beans for $6.99 and it was all incredible. 

You have to enter through the back, the parking lot is a little sketchy feeling right when you pull in but when you park there's plenty of lighting over the back door. Try it!"
1,"I realize that most people who need a phone usually don't check reviews on Yelp, but for those that do, stay away from this location. These people are trained to tell bald face lies in order to make sales. The reason I say trained is because I've seen a pattern with the employees. I was told in March of 2011 that I should buy a 4G Samsung 1 because 4G would be coming out any day. A year and 1/2 later I dropped the phone and cracked the scree and still on contract I told them I did not want an upgraded Samsung III if they weren't coming out of 4G anytime soon, the the next employee sounded like he was giving me the same sale pitch the first one did, that 4G was coming out, giving me that nudge to spend more money than I wanted to.

Also I was sold a Sprint MIFI and I was told you could go anywhere at anytime and connect to the internet. After about 6 visits to this location for tech support, we end up resetting the thing each time, but if I'm in the field, and since that's required every single time I use it, I might as well just use my phone for internet and save 10-15 minutes. I paid $100 of this Piece of cr..p thing and $37 per month and they flat out refuse to let me out of the contract.

I was being sarcastic when the manager after several tech support visits between my phones and MIFI asked me my name and I told him he should know it by now, and his response was that I should be thankful that at least someone was helping me.

It's damn near a monopoly, but not quite. There's still Verizon and T-Mobile, and god forbid running a business with Cricket, which is a small step down from Sprint."
1,"First time to Lonnie's. Walked in and everyone looked up at me and then looked right back down. Couldn't get anyone to answer my questions or even acknowledge me. Lonnie himself was there and when the salesperson directed my question to him (3 times) he never answered. They also didn't have two of the three things I came in to buy (all of which they list on their website). They were also giving another woman a hard time about her company card, despite the woman protesting that she comes in to the store ""all the time."" VERY rude to her and I was surprised they would speak that way to any customer, especially in front of another one.

They may be a gem for some jewelry folks, but the terrible customer service ensured that I will never be back."
1,"I love that they have more fruit aguas but they don't usually make them with mainly just the fresh fruit like other places (Los Reyes de La Torta has the best I think). I think it is a powder mix with some fruit cut up in it. 

But I have tried them since I love fresh fruit and they are closer to me. Watch out to because several times when I have ordered items they charge you for the larger size. When I asked about this they tell me ""oh we only have large not small or medium"" even though those sizes and their prices are listed on the menu. Shady!  This has happened to me at a couple of their different locations."
1,"DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL

If there was a zero star it would be more appropriate.  Made a reservation through hotels.com for $200 for one night stay.  Arrived at 1am and there was nobody at the desk for a good 5 minutes.  Finally the host comes out with the worst attitude ever.  Then as we are checking in she wants to charge an extra $60 for ""late check in"".  Needless to say I was irate and only needed the room for about 7 hours of sleep (for $200).  I complained and instead of resolving the issue, she called the police to have me removed from the premise.   When the police got there they realized it was a complete waste of their time and were laughing at the situation.  They still had to do their job and make me leave.  

Today I am trying to contact the hotel to get a refund, as they have considered me a ""no show"" and charged my card.  I have called three times to speak with the manager who is ""too busy"" to take my call.  She also won't call me back.  

Entire lack of professionalism and courtesy.  If I pay $200 a night for a hotel I expect to be greeted at the door, and provided with friendly staff.  They were very combative and inappropriate.  Neglected to have a conversation and try and resolve the issue - resorted to aggressiveness because the staff wasn't intelligent enough to cooperate."
1,"The second I saw the guy eying my windshield I regretted my decision to go here. Before he could say anything, I nicely said ""Hi - I don't need that fixed, Thanks!"" and then he waited for me by the door to argue with me about it. Not helping your cause dude. 

These guys are also the ""up-selling KINGS."" No thank you, I am not going to pay you $49.99 for a filter I can get at Auto Zone for $15. And that was only ONE of at least seven things they tried to up-sell me on. I am guessing I was also being quoted special ""dumb girl"" pricing.

I finally get my car back, get inside and leave. When I got back to work I realized that my floor mats were actually DIRTIER than when I brought it in and they barely wiped anything down. There was a screw laying there from where they took my cabin filter out to try and up-sell me, so they didn't even put it back in right. The vacuum job was shabby at best and my windows were still dirty. There are water spots everywhere.

Now, I actually feel the need to take my car somewhere else to be checked to make sure they actually changed the oil. Needless to say, I won't be returning to this Danny's, or any Danny's for that matter. They have really gone downhill over the last few years."
1,"I purchased a pair similar to these. After about two years of gentile use, the thong on the left sandal fell apart. Since Dillards won't accept returns items this old and because it appears to be an obvious defect, I wrote to Cole Haan for a replacement. All they could offer me was a 30% discount off of my next purchase. Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I really thought Cole Haan quality was superior and that stye would stand behind their products if something went wrong. Turns out I was wrong. Others need to consider this before paying a premium to purchase Cole Haan products."
5,"I had a horrible experience at another vet office and decided, on the recommendation of a work colleague, to go to Truesdell instead. I'm thrilled to have found a place so close to home that we LOVE and am so thankful that my dog has Dr. Meier as his vet. We've seen both other Drs when she was gone and they are both excellent as well.  I know it's more expensive than some others but I like the fact that it is a full hospital so that if something major happened my dog would not have to go anywhere else. They also did his neutering and are always very patient with my questions as I am a first time dog owner and still have lots to learn. All the staff seems very competent and the techs are very good at their jobs as well. Thanks Truesdell! We love you!"
5,"Best salsa in Phoenix!  

I love Mi Amigo's!  The salsa and chips are always fresh and there's always plenty of it on your table.  I tried almost everything and it's all good.  But my favorite is the chicken chimichanga or mini chimi platter - so delicious!"
1,"this was the WORST Denny's experience I've ever had, and no one expects much from a Denny's so that's saying a lot. not only did our server jump in our faces to rush our drink order he didn't let us finish it before walking away and not getting what we requested. ignored us until our cold food showed up and it wasn't even what we ordered. he threw extra napkins from someone elses table on ours in a ""don't want to put these where they really go mannor"" and didn't show up again until he dropped our bill which charged me for the food I ordered bit didn't get. maybe he would've been a better server if the apparent drugs he was on weren't a factor, and when we confronted the manager she was rude and obviously didn't care that this staff sucks. not to mention unwelcoming to straight customers if any Denny's promoted itself as a straight Denny's would gays feel welcome there and would that be socially acceptable? hell no! way to go Denny's ihop for me next time!"
5,"I have to say, for us ladies who love ladies, there aren't many options for bars.  That being said, I think the Cash is pretty swell.  They aren't trying to be something they're not (ZGirl club, take notes!), they're not pretentious and there's never a wait/cover to get in.  The bartenders are chill and remember you even if it's been a long time.  I love Kat and the other bartender (name unknown to me) with the lovely silver hair who always asks ""what'll it be, babe?"".  The music isn't exactly my style, but they do throw a few booty-shakers in amongst the country ballads.  I love watching the dance floor, as most of the ladies/gents/others know how to cut a rug.  They have a large outdoor patio for the folks who enjoy smoke and the drinks are cheap:)  Love what you do, don't change a thing!"
1,"This is one of those places that really pisses me off. 

The food is very good, the beer is even better, and the atmosphere is super-cool. It's just the type of place we need more of in downtown Phoenix. It's even open late!

Unfortunately I have to give it one lonely star because the service so often SUCKS. More than once I'v been told that because I don't have a reservation I'd have to wait up to 45 minutes despite the fact that the place was less than 50% full.

The final straw was in the middle of July, when I was asked to ""please wait outside"" for my table. Are you kidding me? The food ain't THAT good."
1,"How this place stays in business I have no idea. Food is gross,  the place is empty all the time, small dishes, over priced. Service is totally crap. The parking lot  looks like a place one could get raped in. If you're handicapped you are screwed one parking space for the whole building. Pot holes everywhere, I can't believe they haven't been sued yet for the condition of the parking lot."
1,"Don't park your car and expect it to be there when you come out after eating there.  They towed my car today because I did not eat in the restaurant.  Unfortuantly we did eat there and could not get out of the parking lot because of event across the street.  So we walked around the nuthouse01area for a bit came back and car was gone. Talked to manager who said we did not eat there and I showed receipt and was told that was I was not seen on some camera so I did not eat there.  Now have to wait until Monday to get my car.  Well thats it never eat here again.  

Lost customer for ever Wendy'  Wish Dave were alive he would have treated customer much differently.
Shame on Wendy's"
5,"My husband found this little place near his office a few years ago.  What a gem.  The owner Jaime, is honest, fast and very good.  He knows what he's doing.  Not the biggest of places, but he has a nice selection of jewelry.  He's designed some custom pieces for us, working on one for me right now and we couldn't be happier."
1,"One of the employees stole my sons wallet.  He left it at the table and with in a half hour is disappeared.  The management are not willing to do anything about this and say that it just disappeared and that their employees do not steal.  I have managed restaurants, and theft is quite common.  Ever watch restaurant undercover on Foodnetwork.  The management actually laughed at me that i would think the employees would steal."
1,"This review is not a review of the store but of AT&T wireless service in general.  AT&T is the worst wireless service I've ever had.  I have more dropped calls and less bars in more places than any other carrier I've had, and I've had Verizon, T-Mobile (the best) and now AT&T.

I would have never switched service if I didn't have to in order to get my iPhone.  And for the record ... the iPhone is the best object I've EVER owned.  I recommend you avoid AT&T wireless at all costs (unless you want the best phone in the world, only then is it worth it)."
1,"Went here yesterday.  Ordered the pulled pork sandwich, side of beans and drink for me to eat there. Beans had chunks of what tasted like dehydrated dried onion in them and they were not hydrated. Sandwich bun was totally soggy and pork was dry. Ordered the 1/4 chicken meal with dark meat (does not like breast meat)  and drink for my husband to take with him because he wasn't hungry.  We sat down with my meal and ate, he had not gotten his meal yet.  About 20-25 min later, went to counter to get his meal and they didn't even have it ready!  Then they said, oh, is the white meat ok?  We don't have any of the dark meat ready right now?  After 25 minutes and they didn't have any ready? Husband reluctantly said ok.  Got home and later ate it and it was all dried out and appeared old.  We will not be going back, the customer service is terrible and so is their food these days. Spent $20.00 on a small amount and food and this is what we got. Try https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Barbecue-Company-Grill-Cafe/100123416554
The Barbecue Company instead.  Their food and customer service are both great. Honey Bear's you lost a customer. BBQ Company is only open Mon-Fri until 3:00pm but worth the visit.  Once a month they have a buffet!"
1,"My taxi fare from the airport to the hotel (six miles... took about 10 minutes) was $22. What the heck is that about??

Also - he wouldn't take my credit card. Cash only? Fine. 

I only had two $20 bills on me, so I asked for change. He didn't have any. None. NO CHANGE. 

Rat bastard."
1,"I called to schedule an appointment for a pap smear and to check out a suspicious lump on my breast. I was a little baffled when the scheduler told me the next available appointment was not until a few weeks, seeing as I clearly stated I need to get my lump on my breast examined. I may only be 22 years old, and it may be rare for a 22 year old to have a malignant lump, but I do have a family history of breast cancer that was conceived early in their 20's. 

As for my appointment, I had it scheduled at 7pm and I wasn't seen by the NP until 7:45. When the NP (nurse practitioner) came in, she checked out my lump and told me we need to get an ultrasound right away to make sure it isn't anything we need to worry about. When I had my pap smear she told me it looks like I have a yeast infection too. 

She also gave me ""tips"" about keeping your vagina healthy such as Douching. First of all, this is HORRIBLE advice. Douching is the worst thing you can do for vaginal flora. This is the main reason why women get vaginal infections and bacterial vaginosis. I had to laugh at her but she is a NP, she knows what she is talking about...

There were two things that really bothered me about my appointment. The scheduler after my appointment told me she would call me the very next day to let me know the time of my ultrasound at Good Sam. I never heard from her the next day. This is very frustrating for me because I had to wait a while to even get in to see someone and now that I have a suspicious lump, I feel like we are just taking our time for something that needs to be a priority! Second thing is that I was clearly told I have a yeast infection and was not given any prescriptions to take care of it. 

I really feel like the office just does not care about my health or concerns and didn't do anything to make me feel comfortable. It was just a waiting game; wait for your appointment, when your appointment finally comes wait an hour for the doctor and wait some more to have an ultrasound scheduled. 

I will NOT go back here again.

*update--I called to see why they hadn't called me back to schedule my ultrasound and they acted like I was dumb--saying that they gave me the order to schedule it somewhere else. They basically lost my order and are going to research my situation and see what happened. I HAVE A LUMP ON MY BREAST and this is how they treat situations like this. I'm very disappointed."

1,Terrible Nasty Trashy Place
5,Yesterday I forgot my lunch and I decided to go to the Central Cafe for lunch.  I'm so glad I did.  The special was Shredded Beef Tacos.  They were by far the best tacos I have had in a really long time. :)  Thanks Central Cafe for the best tacos.
5,"Hot diggity dang this place is just of the hook tasty.  The big unit is this huge amazing hot dog, with chili, relish, tomato, jalapenos, and cheese.  Also tried the brownie dessert and oh mylanta....it was orgasmically delicious!"
5,One of the few places that tastes like your Nana made it. AUTHENTIC!
5,"I love this place.  It had been a while since my wife and I visited the Arizona Science Center, but we had to go when the Body Worlds and The Brain exhibit came to Phoenix.   Fascinating and amazingly preserved human bodies.  This is the first time my wife has encouraged me to look at naked women.  Honestly, if you have a chance to visit before the exhibit leaves town, go.  Soon.  Now would be good.  This special engagement will be gone after May 31, 2011.

There are a number of regular exhibits that are geared toward kids, many of them hands-on.  Several school bus loads of kids were there when we visited.   We did not spend much time near those areas.  You might try the late afternoon/evening, especially if you have your own young ones.  We returned again at a special event for adults only.  The ""kid"" zones can be entertaining for adults too.  Though, to a lesser degree.

The Dorrance Planetarium was oh, so cool.  Literally.  After rubbing shoulders with the mobs of people it was nice to just sit and ""chill"" in this well conditioned room.  I highly recommend the ""Black Holes"" presentation.  Unless....like my wife, you experience MoTiOn SiCkNeSs.  In which case it's a nice cool place to shut your eyes for a spell.  Though we did not see the Roller Coaster presentation I would expect that to have a similar effect.  

 The special exhibits are what draws us back to the Arizona Science Center.  From the Titanic to Body Worlds, the diversity of scientific topics and the creative ways they are presented continues to fascinate."
5,"Considering the fact that San Diego cannot support a lesbian club/bar, I was VERY impressed with this unpretentious place! We showed up on a rainy Friday night, place was a hoppin! 

A little bit o' butch, a little bit o' femme, a few trannys sprinkled in as well as some music and a great and active dance floor. 

I despise country music- but it sure was fun watching these folks do a little two step and beyond (damn, they were good!). They did also play a little hip-hop/Top 40 to mix things up. 

Didn't spot any attitude here, everyone was friendly, smiling, laughing and having a good time, ourselves included!"
5,"This place is awesome.
The Traditional restaurant as well as the deli style restaurant inside.
The assortment of food items is amazing, too many good things to choose from. And the prices are great.
It is a great experience, if you like Mexican food you must go and check it out. This is the closest thing to Mexico without being there. 
After eating it is great to explore the rich colors and products in the market.
And don't forget the Sunday brunch with tons of choices and lots of traditional entertainment."
1,"This place has the worst fuckin service period!. The only reason I continue to eat there is because the food is bangin!!!.. This is the only place I know of where the delivery driver answers the phone,takes your order and then asks for a tip before the food has even been delivered, that's rude in my book. I will probably end up with a lugii in my food when they read this post. I have eaten in the actual restraunt too and have too admit the service there was also shitty. The only reason I have to put this negative review up so hopefully they will fix their problems, I am pretty sure anyone who has ordered food from here has had a simular experiance as my family. Food is good though and I would rate the food a 10 out of 10. If  you read this post pizza heaven please don't spit in my food next time I order."
1,"Corp store on Lien rd was not a good choice.  The manager of the store was very unhelpful and gave me the run around about trying to fix my phone. If you want good service with people who actually care, go to the store on University Ave"
5,"My family has been going to Dr. Killian for years now and he has always been an extremely good dentist, very kind, professional, and comforting when it comes to some of the more serious procedures. Not only that, he has just recently updated his facility via a $1 Million investment! He now has luxorious massaging dental chairs, state-of-the-art equipment and even a moveable LCD TV above the chair so as to relax you while you're worked on! The lobby is gorgeous with a massive 60"" some odd LCD HDTV etc. This is an EXCELLENT dentist. He has been in the business for, well since before i was even born! which is over 20 years, so he knows exactly what he is doing. Also his son just moved into the building so there are now 2 great dentists working in the same building."
5,"Awesome place. Really nice. Outstanding service from Matt. Food is delicious, recommend the lobster bisque."
5,"Al the bartender was the best server we've had! We had a terrible experience at a nearby restaurant and decided to head in to a favorite spot we always enjoy and Al undid the terrible experience we had elsewhere. Highly recommend Canyon Cafe. Plus it's one of the few places that gives you chips and salsa without a charge.  Great food, fantastic service and the best chips you've ever had! This place is consistently good. Al is our new favorite!"
1,"I brought my car & was conned into getting the ""express detail"" for 29.99(on sale from 39.99)..they didn't explain that didn't include the wSh so when I went to pay it was $53...ok fine....sign says it takes 15 minutes... 45 minutes later I knew something was up & went to see... Upon seeing me coming they told me it was finished... I noticed a film on front 1/4panel & door....I asked them to wipe down but it wouldn't come off.. Manager comes out says it must have been on there when I brought it in...I told him the car is a month old & the film  wasn't there when I came in...  Then a detailer comes over & tries some wax on it & it seemed to do the trick but they told me I would have to pay extra AND make an appointment for the wax job as they didn't cause the film... Bottom line is the manager is a meathead & this place blows.

Update.... Now I notice there are 20-30 nats or maybe fleas on the inside of windshield... This place is terrible..."
5,"Only been in once but I loved it, this bar was one of the factors on moving down to this area. You will see me there alot. love the people and how nice the employees are. Both indoor and outdoor seating. I came from seattle and this bar is way better than any of the lesbian clubs on Capitol hill."
5,"This is the best Culver's around because it is company owned (not franchised) and they use this store for training new managers, so everyone really knows their job and they are not miserable like most fast food employees.  And the food is almost always perfect."
1,Wanted to go try this place out for Restaurant Week. Stopped in and when we were greeted at the front we were told the earliest we could get in was at 9pm. There were many empty tables and there wasn't even a waiting list for people without reservations. The situation at the door just wasn't handled very well. Can't comment on the food but we'll eat at one of the other hundred restaurants in the metro area. We know we can get some food there.
1,Stopped into this shop during spring training.  The staff was nice but he really pushed the Kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop.  We bought 3 of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them.  The cigars didn't draw well and were generally not very good.  We went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent $170 there the day before and only bought the Kristoffs on their recommendation (at 10 a stick).  We won't be going back.
5,"One of my favorite Art Galleries on Roosevelt Row, a mandatory monthly stop for me."
5,Happy to live in a city with a club like this.
1,"This place had a lot of hype...one of the best rated restaurants in town. We were extremely disappointed. The service was terrible, we sat for about 15 minutes before we even had a menu and were asked if we wanted a drink. When we did finally get the menus we were extremely disappointed with what was supposed to be an extensive wine list. The wine list turned out to be rather weak with a small selection from each region - even France wasn't well represented. 

After another 15 minutes of waiting without any contact from the non existent server we walked out...and walked down the road to Chelseas...which was solid."
1,"I have to say, I was extremely disappointed when stopping in for lunch today.  My husband raved about Tom's lunch he had several months ago.  He said they had ""killer"" potato salad and a chili-mac-and-cheese you'd never find anywhere.

The 2 of us ordered; Prime Rib French Dip, Cuban Pork Sandwich and a BLT.

The French Dip was the worst of the 3.  Dry, very over cooked - crispy meat - nothing that we expected, a huge disappointment.  The Cuban Pork was mediocre at best.  The BLT - only okay at best.  I have to say the sides were a different story - the Cole Slaw is the best you may ever eat.  Fries - same, excellent.

The staff was very attentive, hostess was cheerful and welcomed us warmly.

I don't know what Tom's looked like prior to the remodel - I sure wish I would have made it to lunch before the remodel - we certainly will not go back.  $45.00 for 3 lunches and one soda - not worth it."
1,"I hate giving this place only one star, because I love the location and the history. The service was wonderful and the staff was friendly, however I just can't give a $130 dinner a good review when it was so lack luster, tame, bland and out right boring. Perhaps they are catering to an older crowd that has dietary restrictions on flavor and spice, but their menu is dated - makes me think they haven't revamped it in 15-30 years. Their oso bucco portion was tiny and slimy maybe only 3oz and the risotto was bland. Had some cold shrimp spring roll? appetizer that tasted like they scraped it off the bottom of an aquarium. We went on a Saturday night expecting it to be packed, should have known the food was terrible. Please redo your menu!"
1,"IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!!
My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).
This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. 

We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. 

We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. 
To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family."
1,I went there last week for breakfast. I left with a burnt bagels and a watered down latte. The employees don't take any pride in their product. I sent my comments into corporate and they didn't reply. Overall no body cares. They've lost a customer. I would recommend either Starbucks which is across the street or Wildflower Bakery. I always get great service and good food at both locations.
1,"Historic, yes. Worth the visit, no.

Problem 1: Hosting a political event without warning during the Saturday lunch hour.  No signs on the outside, no warning until we're in and heading for the table, and we realize, ""There's a guy, stumping for Mayor of Phoenix, and he's going to just talk the entire lunch hour.""  So this means we can either enjoy conversation with our friends or we can sit and eat quietly while an unelected politician tells us why we shouldn't trust elected politicians.

Problem 2: Very dry chicken.  Seriously, I think they stuck a frozen Wal-Mart chicken breast in the microwave and nuked it for 8 minutes or something.  How hard is it to make a chicken sandwich taste good?  So now I get to try to choke down dry chicken and terrible political speeches at the same time.

Problem 3:  The candidate finally quits talking.  Then he takes a photo standing between the waitresses and says, ""It's like beauty on the outside, and beast on the inside.""  No one laughs.  But then the owner comes up to our table as we're finally getting the chance to talk to each other, and she spends another 15 minutes telling us why we should vote for a certain party and why she wants to move into Phoenix from her home in Fountain Hills.  My favorite line: ""We need to make it harder for folks to drive so that they start using public transportation.""  But of course, she's not using the light rail on her way in from Fountain Hills.  She just wants the people off her streets when she's trying to drive in and out of the city.

The only good thing about the whole trip--apart from our friends, who are awesome--was that the waitresses were professional and competent.  They earned a good tip and they treated us well."
5,"I was there last night, two words - CHOCOLATE CAKE! Try it. The cream cheese frosting was an awesome touch with the wonderfully moist cake."
1,"Been here twice and each time ended up having to make a rush trip to the bathroom after. The first time the shrimp came out uncooked, I sent it back and it seemed fine. Barely made it out of the restaurant before I had to rush to the restroom. The second time around, I had the same issue except also 24 hours of stomach cramps. A few other issues with service but minor compared to routine food poisoning."
5,"Just when it seemed like I couldn't be impressed by a Mexican restaurant anymore, here comes Comedor Guadalajara. When so many others stopped offering free chips and salsa while you wait I was SHOCKED by not only getting chips and salsa but a cup of soup while waiting for our meal. We went in for lunch, and while we had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table, the service was awesome and we were in and out quickly. They do not mess around here and I was thoroughly impressed. The food was close to the Tex Mex that I crave from home and the value for the money is solid. The chili rellanos was killer. Will be back regularly!"
1,"way to go Macayo's, thanks for ruining my birthday meal.  I had hundreds of choices, and sadly, i chose you :-( 

after 45 minutes of waiting for our food, i practically begged somebody else's waiter to either find our food, or find our waitress.  a few minutes later, our waitress comes out and says that they ""can't find one of the plates"".  

what?  after 45 minutes they realized they have a ticket dangling there, right in front of their faces, and they ""can't find one of the plates""?  we both ordered off of the 'summer specials' menu.  you know, the one you charge double for.

needless to say, we walked. Mi Patio on 3rd Ave/Osborn was much better, and much cheaper anyway.  and they let ol' BobbyQ know that they not only appreciated my business, but that they appreciated my birthday."
1,"Really slow on drive thru my husband and i sat in our car for maybe over 15min. and the past two times I've been there they had no ranch or honey. 
A real horrible experience, never again will I go there."
5,"I lived in Coronado for several years and my family and I frequented this place a lot. The owners know my dad pretty well, and they are always super friendly to my brother and I. They have a pretty decent wine selection now, since the neighborhood began to show interest in it. They carry all the norms as far as snacks go, but then they have their selection of foods you might need but don't want to go all the way to the grocery store to get. They also have hot pickles that I crave on a regular basis. 

I don't live in the neighborhood anymore so I don't come here as often, but for the locals it's a must. Or even if you're in the area....."
5,"After reading all the reviews i was really hesitant on going to this restaurant. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by since we were craving Chinese and decided to sit in the bar. Obviously everyone has a different opinion but this place was amazing!

First off, the hostess was adorable and incredibly sweet. The bartender was amazing and he made us feel right at home. And the owner of the restaurant seemed like the sweetest lady in the world. The decor was what I would expect from a Chinese restaurant but they made the restaurant feel classy and not cheap.

I ordered the pepper steak no tomatoes and my boyfriend got pork egg foo young. Wow is all I can say. The beef actually tasted like real fresh meat! Not the rubber fake kind you get at other cheap takeouts. The only draw back i had was that the peppers and onions were cut pretty big but that wasn't a huge issue. My boyfriends egg foo young was like none other and they sure didn't hold back on the sauce! The pork inside was actually Chinese bbq pork and it sure added a kick.

Overall, the prices are a tad bit high but worth every penny! All the workers and the owner are so helpful and you can tell they really appreciate their customers. This is definitely my #1 stop for Chinese on the east side!"
1,Be sure to ask if your car is ready yet. They forget to announce it sometimes and leave you in the lobby waiting for Christmas.
5,"Boar's head meats and cheeses are what they use for their sandwiches, and they also have olives,and some other deli items. The sandwiches are great, and the service is friendly. I miss their old employee John, he was such a charming, handsome young lad. :-( They even know Chris Burke!!!!"
5,"We went to Cheuvront for the first time this past Saturday and had a perfect dining experience.  The staff was super welcoming, the food that we ordered couldn't get any better and the wine was superb.  I tried two different wines and enjoyed them both - our server (Chris, I believe) was very knowledgeable and eager to answer my questions on the wine selections.  Will be back very soon!  Good job, Cheuvront!"
5,Love this place went for the second time yesterday for the Indian Fair & Market. Everything is way out of my price range but its still enjoyable to admire the art.
1,It's gross.  Don't waste your money please!  Hope this helps you!
1,"This place is dirty.  The plate my food was served on was dirty, our waitress's apron was dirty, and the booth we sat in was dirty; it left a huge grease stain on my daughter's pants.   This place is disgusting."
5,"Being from Baltimore, Maryland, I couldn't help but notice a sign out front of Coronado Cafe claiming host to ""Phoenix's best crab cakes""... I was quite skeptical at first... mainly due to the fact that my experience with crab cakes in Phoenix has involved too much filler and low quality crab meat. But after reading some pretty good reviews on Yelp, I knew I just had to find out for myself! After biting the bullet on the $24 price tag for the crab cake dinner I was presented with a plate of pure heaven on earth. Two 2oz crab cakes made from 100% JUMBO lump Maryland Blue Crab drizzled lightly in a homemade remoullade, with a side of potatos and asparagus! Theses crab cakes are the real deal! Rumor is that the chef or owner or somebody there is actually from Maryland, and it shows! PEOPLE OF PHOENIX: THIS IS WHAT A CRAB CAKE SHOULD TASTE LIKE!!!"
1,"The server was over the top obnoxious.   He insisted on having our names just to take our order.  He was very friendly but it was to the point of intrusive.  He pulled up a chair and chatted AT us on three different occasions.  When I ordered my food he insisted that I order something different.  When I finally got my food it was mediocre at best.  

The manager was also having a meeting with two new employees at a near by table, so we had to listen to all the Applebee's rules and regulations.  Let me tell you, there are a lot of them. The manager's list went on and on for our entire meal  Almost, every sentence started with ""I can't"" or  ""You can't"".  The manager made me hate this place even more."
5,"have been taking my vehicles here for a few years since we moved downtown. up front: they AREN'T the cheapest but they go over and above normal places, don't treat you like an idiot and tend to fix small things for free. in the end, you do end up getting what you pay for. my beat up old car pretty much still exists due to them, and my wifes newer car gets taken care of so as to last us as long as possible. 

plus its right by Band-Aids so you can drop your car off and 'wait in the lobby' at the gentlemans club, wink wink nudge nudge"
5,Love this place! My favorite? Bloody Mary of course! I'd say it's the best Bloody Mary in town. Food is always delicious. Staff is always friendly and helpful. In three years of going to Monty's Blue Plate Diner we never had a negative experience.
5,"hands down one of the best breakfasts my wife and i have had. stopped in here based on the positive reviews from fellow yelpers and was sure glad i did. 

this is a good sized diner at a truck stop. the first thing that caught our eye was the pastries - they were all huge and all looked great. tip - be sure to save space for at least one. 

i went with the cinnamon roll french toast and was very pleased. very large portion and great taste - go witht the sausage patty over the links. people behind us had links on their plate and they didnt look too appetzing. the patty was good. 

wife went with a chicken friend steak, eggs, and hashbrowns. hashbrowns left a bit to desire but they get bonus points for being real potatoes and fresh. 

overall, great experience and we were in and out in 35 mins so we could continue out journey. looking forward to stopping here again sometime soon."
1,"I stopped to get my haircut here on a friday afternoon.  I didn't know where to go since I just moved to town, and I thought, hmm, there name is ""Great Clips"" so if they live upto half of that I'll be okay.  My hair isn't hard to cut, just your standard mens cut, and this place couldn't even meet my minimum standards.  It was small, dirty (there was still hair from the guy before me at the station they sat me at) and absolutely no customer service.  The girl who greeted me didn't even finish her sentence welcoming me to Great Clips.  ""Hey, welcome to Grea...trailingoff mumblemumble...""  then somehow my simple haircut got turned into a military buzz cut.  all this for 14$ plus tip.  I felt like I spent 10 minutes alone in a clost with a ass therapist minus the ""the"""
1,I would not recommend this place at all. I've driven by this place going to work. I picked up food for some co-workers and the chili rellenos had a piece of chewed gum in it. That is the most gross un-hygenic thing a restaurant could possibly do. We were so disgusted that we didn't call and complain. There is no excuse for this! I will never recommend anyone to go here.
5,Only place in the area that makes an authentic Vienna beef Chicago style hot dog.  Simply awesome!
1,"The room was fine, obviously outdated but it looks as though they are upgrading currently. The food on the other hand was overpriced and gross. Do yourself a favor and do not order room service. It looked as though it was prepared at a truck stop, nuked and then brought up to my room. I complained, they said sorry and that was it. No new food, no help from the front desk and still charged me for it. Platinum member service my butt."
5,"I love this supper club. 

I love waiting at the bar drinking a little brandy.  I love that the waitstaff takes your order while you relax at the bar.  

I love the lake perch more than most fish in Madison. 

I have never had a bad experience.  Enough said."
5,Great. nuff said.
1,"i hope the owners and/or management read this review so they can be made aware of the terrible experience i had at noon today (2/21/13).  unfortunately i don't know the name of the female employee working during this time-she was on the short side with long, dark hair in a ponytail.  several sales were lost today due to her total incompetence. 

-


i should have known when i walked in and received no greeting from the barista that this was going to be a stellar time. 

there was only one other customer standing at the counter, and two women waiting for their coffee to be made.  

as i approached the counter, i realized that what i originally thought was a customer was actually a friend of the barista's. the two of them were completely engrossed in some conversation about who knows what while the barista finished the coffee for the two waiting women. 

once she finished, i waited for her to acknowledge me and take my order.  instead, she continued right on with her conversation with her pal, never breaking to say hello or even make eye contact!  instead, the two of them kept on chatting while she started making herself a coffee! 

meanwhile, another customer walked in and stood behind me at the counter.  the two of us exchanged a few perplexed looks as the barista/pal nonsense continued on with no end in sight. after several minutes of this, he decided to give up and leave. the barista took no notice of this.  

at that point, i glanced at my phone and realized i had been standing there for a full ten minutes! ten minutes, debit card in hand, standing two feet from the barista with not even the slightest acknowledgement whatsoever. 

was it possible that i died in the car ride to hava java and no one could see me? 

that was enough for me. i backed away from the counter and got the hell out of there. 

 
hava java-you should be absolutely ashamed at how this employee is treating your customers. i do not plan to ever return, and i'm sure the other customer who walked out will be thinking twice about where he gets his coffee from now on."
1,"In on Tuesday, 7/24.  Tried the pizza burger after someone finally decided to come A. get a drink order after sitting down 5 minutes prior.  B.  Recite the specials off the chalk board because they didn't know what the specials were.  The  burger was ok, but didn't have the peperoni flavor I would have expected.  I've been here a ton of times, and the food is for the most part, very good, but service this evening was horrible.  I had to ask for another beverage 1/2 way through my meal, and ultimately walk to the bar to pay the bill.  Go drunk.  You may not notice that the staff doesn't give a crap about you, or getting your money.  We could have walked out...and almost did without paying."
5,"I lived in Phoenix for 12 years before I found this place - now I would never recommend any Mexican restaurant but this one for friends from out of town or newbies.  Rosita's chips are the best - it's worth a trip just for the chips.  I usually eat there at least once a week - the cheese enchiladas with green sauce are my favorite, but occasionally I stray and have never had anything that isn't wonderful.  If you like soup it's also the place to go - surprising for a Mexican restaurant, but soups are amazing."
1,"Im very sorry that I spent money on a groupon before attending a class but alas, you live and learn. The staff is very rude especially if you had purchased the groupon (THE NERVE!) because apparently, you need to know ALL THE BIKRAM. Not a good place for beginners or anyone with a sense of smell for that matter. The carpet really is a health hazard and I left feeling sick from the stench. The instructor didnt bother to take one second to explain things carefully or slowly, just reciting the poses SO FAST it was hard to keep up. How can one relax and focus when they dont know what to do? HORRIBLE. I wouldn't ever recommend this to anyone. Sick."
1,"Not sure what all the hype is about for this place.....Very average.... The food seemed similar to Del Taco, but on a real plate. The Fajitas was a joke....This place looks run down & old, which scares me a little bit to eat here. Canyon Cafe/Sam's Mexican Cafe at Arizona Center downtown....NOW we're talkin'!  ...Waaaaay better!"
1,"if you're looking for a nice night out, keep looking..."
5,"As good as it gets as far as diners go.  I'm not usually considered to be a hipster, but it might rub off on me if I spent more time her.  Great crowd hanging out eating delicious food.  Tiny enough that you HAVE to talk to the staff, they're right next to you.  Unless you sit outside.  That might be fun, too.

I've never actually been to a diner that had a liquor license, so have a hurricane with your brunch."
1,"I have put off writing this review for so long because the memories of my experience there are so ugly that I needed weeks to recover. It was my Aunt's birthday and she _loves_ Macayo's. I went along begrudgingly and the results were terrifying.

As a Phoenix native, I've known Macayo's on Central for decades. Its unique facade emulates the style of some grand Guatemalan Mayan temple, but... no, not really. And what is it that you want when you see pictures of Machu Picchu or of Tikal? You want to climb the steps, to _go in_. In the case of Macayo's, you must resist this urge with all your might.

The main entrance is from the back and is true to form in the Egyptian style. A post and lintel rectangular opening leads to a long narrow hallway slightly sloped which opens to an antechamber branching off to the splendorous caverns within. Um. Except this article is about _food_, not a history of architecture lecture! Bleh.

As is my custom I order a cheese crisp straight off; I'm allergic to corn so the endless bowls of hardened, impervious-to-rot corn chips (see pic) just repel me. After the pushy (more on that later) waitress scurries off I notice my fork (see the picture) and realize that with the caked-on food, this place might be cutting corners on lots of stuff, namely that the tortillas might be so cheap that they are the type to be sprinkled with corn starch to keep them from sticking to each other. The waitress returns and I ask her to please check the ingredient list for the tortillas for corn starch. A few minutes later she returns with the label torn from the tortilla bag and says that without her glasses she cannot read the list. I'm not joking when I say that the list goes on as long as this paragraph. Chemical after chemical, non-food food after non-food food. And then there right in the middle is corn starch, corn meal, corn flour and corn syrup. In FLOUR tortillas! 

I immediately canceled my order for the cheese crisp and resolved not to place a single bite of anything into my mouth. ""Was the water bad too?"" I wondered.

I'm not sure where it started, but Tex-Mex goers have come to expect the attentive busboys to continually flit about filling and refilling bowls of corn chips and salsa. Macayo's sets the standard. It seemed the bowls dropped every few seconds as my family devoured them while waiting for the birthday girl to show. The salsa was gloopy (again with the pic) and might have had something added to the mix after it was poured from a gigantic vat, but I doubt it. My sensible companion said it didn't taste fresh at all.

The birthday girl was almost 45 minutes late. After 40 minutes we discussed among us just ordering anyway. We decided to order, except that our decision quickly became an argument with the waitress who insisted that we wait for her. Um, whoa! Is this really happening to me? I must be in some kind of Mayan burial temple, I'm dead, and my servants and family were buried with me along with food and I'm going to be here for the next thousand years until someone decrypts the secret book and inserts the starfish-shaped key into the stony entrance to free my evil spirit back on the world.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! Yes, I loved the Mummy movies.

But back to our pushy waitress. After the family tried over and over, unsuccessfully, to cajole me into ordering something, anything, we waited for the results. You'll have to see the pictures.

You know you're in a nightmare of menu hell when an item's description has to change languages from English in order to accurately describe its content. The average speaker uses something like 20,000 words regularly and you can't even find a few to accurately or even poetically describe this item? The steak was described with being covered in a spinach queso sauce (see pic). Those two words had to have been taken straight off the labels of the two cans that were dumped into a warming pot to create this sauce. Think nacho cheesy, oil and corn starch and that lovely orangey-yellow coloring. Disgusting.

My brother ordered a taco plate (see pic) and made the mistake of trying to bite into the taco shell with his teeth. This item should have come with a disclaimer and a hammer. Envision eating crab but with the shell still on it. He gave up quickly and dug out the innards with his fork, snail style. 

Macayo's should stick to their success like some cornstarch-less badly made stack of tortillas, namely large-scale manufactured canned foods sold to those who still think Phoenix is a town of rolling tumbleweeds and cowboys. Let them fantasize about questing to Phoenix and entering the secret Mayan temple to discover the secrets within. They can release my tormented soul from the hell that is Macayo's."
5,Dave was fabulous. He explained every thing he did to my car every step of the way to ensure I understood before he did any work. He was extremely accommodating and very friendly.
1,"The view is nice, but the food was cold and service was REALLY slow. Better off just getting foods from one of the stands. Was hoping for a fancy ballpark experience this was not it."
1,Very rude service. Poor choices of sides (e.g. no french fries)
1,"I usually go elsewhere when I do laundry but as of late it seems any laundromat I go to seems to be on the fritz of despair. 

I recently went to this location, they had 27 I repeat 27 machines that did not work, it was a mess, and the coin machine I repeat the coin machine was out of service...how the fuck am I suppose to do laundry without quarters. 

Luckily I brought some with me and also had some on reserve in my car ashtray, but I am short just a few bucks for drying. So the girl behind the counter notifies me that she has change which I promptly hand her a 20 and say can I get like two dollars worth of change. she says she can not change out a 20 dollar bill. 

I have had the worse luck at laundromats lately I swear between the dimwitted help and broken machines the only reason this place did not get a flaming bag of dog poo thrown against it's window is because it has a few classic arcade games inside...that probably are out of order too!!!"
1,"I went there for lunch and was exciting about eating there.  I have never been to the restaurant and when I walked in I was impressed with the layout of the restaurant.  Our waiter was friendly and came over right away to offer us drinks. 

The menu is rather pricey so I decided to order a chicken waldorf salad and my co-worker ordered a chicken caesar salad.  When we received our salads the first thing we noticed was that the chicken was pink in both of the salads and it appeared that it had not been cooked enough.  The chicken caesar salad is supposed to come with croutons and it did not.  The chicken waldorf salad was ok but the pinkness in the chicken did bother me.  My co-worker and I should have sent the salads back.  

After we got back to the office, we both commented that our stomachs were a little queasy.  I will definitely not be back to the restaurant.  It is way over priced and I believe that if you are going to pay more for your food it should be amazing.  I can make a better salad at home.  Overall I was disappointed with my first dining experience at Hillstone."
1,Never again. A few years back I was treated with horrible service. We approached the owner about it and he treated us like crap too. Boycotted this bar for 2 years and tried it again. once again they prove to be a-holes. There are plenty of Friendly bars that will appreciate the business.
1,"Regarding UHaul's ""Family of Companies,"" poor customer service, illegal policies, rudeness, and inability to understand the definition of words used on their own contacts:

I ordered a U-Box from UHaul and picked it up (and returned it for shipping) on 6/12. As per their confirmation email to me, it was GUARANTEED to arrive at it's final destination 6/22. It did not arrive until 6/26. I was informed by a local UBox representative that it would be no problem to get the UBox sent to a slightly more convenient location. I kept in touch with her for several days and she then told me she had tried to speak to the shipping department.The shipping department had told her there was no way to change the destination without calling the (undisclosed to me) third party shipping company. Then they told her they couldn't do that as they didn't have a working telephone number for the shipping company!!!!

Every call I have made to UHaul, be it a specific location, regional office, or corporate headquarters has been handed off when I ask about getting a partial refund. Every person directs me to call another office. When I was finally able to get in touch with the originating Madison, WI office, the person I spoke with (supposedly the shipping manager- Brandon Fiddler) was incredibly rude to me as said flat out ""I see it was shipped late. That's how it goes. I'm not giving you anything."" I called corporate, after speaking to this man, I was told that I apparently threatened legal action so they won't speak to me any longer and have closed my case? Seeing as how I never threatened legal action, I find this preposterous, and I challenge them to produce the recording I did so in, since they record all phone conversations. UHaul has taken moving, an already stressful experience, and made it completely miserable. I have spent more than 7 hours on the phone with them, and can't get any resolution at all, and generally, receive nothing but insolence. They love to tell you that you have to contact the originating office or the receiving office or corporate or that the people you need to speak to are all away at the moment and have wildly unpredictable hours.

In addition to all of this, I had initially rented a trailer as well, and had a hitch installed on my car. The day comes to go get my trailer and they (surprise) don't have it. They make me drive out to the middle of friggin' nowhere to get it, 5 minutes before this gas station that does UHaul on the side is closing. We do the paperwork and he's ready to connect my trailer- except the hitch is incomplete! I had to run around this tiny town trying to find the remaining parts and lucky for me this nice guy stayed late. What a complete nightmare.

Update: A very nice guy at the original location approved roughly 30% of my expenses/ demand for money back. But that only happened AFTER I filed a complaint with the BBB, which is still going back and forth. FILE A COMPLAINT WITH BBB ASAP, that is likely the ONLY way they will even pay attention to you. Also, do some googling on it, their customer service isn't the only thing they like to pass blame from office to office on. If you sue them, you have to sue the corporate office in Phoenix. They will say it's a family of franchise companies and pass the blame, but that's how the actual law behind it works, and they will lose.

Oh- in addition, in the process of researching, I found this guy's story, READ IT.

I encourage you ALL to file small claims against one of the WORST companies I have literally ever dealt with in my life (and that includes Charter)!"
1,"Over priced and they forgot my friends pizza order, so I had to wait while mine got cold until theirs came. 
Took way too long to get my drink refills."
1,"If you were to ask me about my in store purchase and customer service I would have said it was great. However that all changed once they had my money and the purchase was complete. I spent nearly $3,000 on a sectional over Memorial Day weekend and was told that my order would take at most 14 weeks but that most orders take around 6 weeks. So at the end of July I call and I'm told August 21st is my delivery date. I call back at the end of August (it took three messages and calls to reach my salesmen) and he says he's been trying to call me but my phone was broken (it wasn't, I've had the same phone for 10 years). Then he tells me it will be September 21st. I begrudgingly agree since this is the maximum timeline in the 14 weeks. Now here we are and I call again today and I'm told 2-4 more weeks. I tried to talk to the manager and express my dissatisfaction and he stood there silent on the other end of the phone offering no concern or effort to expedite my shipment. 

Bottom line: once the sale is final and they have your money they put zero effort in helping you. 

Meanwhile here I sit (on the floor) 4 months after my purchase and I still have another month to go (that is if this time quote is accurate)!

I recommend taking your business elsewhere. Somewhere where customer service is more than a smile to get the sale."
1,I have a degree in hotel and restaurant management so you could probably say that i am a little more critical than most people when it comes to eating out.  Tonight my girlfriend and I went to Christo's.  Our server was horribly slow at taking our drink orders and a table that came in after us already had their salads before we had even placed our order.  The food was mediocre at best we got to go boxes because after an hour of sitting in the restaurant that apparently caters to close personal friends of Abe Lincoln that have nothing more to do than waste an evening at an overpriced restaurant to fill up on caesar salad that tastes like it was dipped in anchovy paste and wish that you hadn't ordered the veal genovese because it just looks like someone threw up on your plate you just want to get out of there.
1,"Worst pedicure ever. The polish bubbled and never cured properly. Besides making a mess of the job, the stylist lathered on a lot of artificial flattery and tried to pressure me to buy a bunch of unnecessary over-priced random products.  But all that I needed when I left this place was a new pedicure--which I gave to myself with some drugstore polish.  Never ever again will I go here!  Absolutely horrible experience."
1,"Disappointing cakes.  The ""buttercreams"" are made with shortening, and no butter at all.  Anyone who has tasted real buttercream knows that it is not as shelf stable or white as shortening frosting and tastes like real butter.  The chocolate cake has some kind of flavoring in it.  Fake rum, maybe?  I really think people buy these cakes because they don't know any better.  Perhaps the term ""buttercream"" is used loosely outside of Europe, but true buttercream is not a concoction of Sweetex (sweetened shortening, commercial grade) and some other fake ingredients.  Carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design.  He's not on the cutting edge, he will only do certain designs that he's been doing since the 80s.  There will be no rolled fondont ribbons or pulled sugar flowers or bright colors.  If you want a simple cake, and don't mind that it is frosted with fake buttercream because that's what is more shelf stable and easy to work with, then go to Carl's.

I see that since I posted my review Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented.  Thanks for your comment and those pictures.  I can definitely tell which ones Carl decorated as opposed to other cake decorators working there.  The cakes with a very simple piping design and love birds have Carl written all over them.  The cakes that are more creative and interesting are done by other people.  Oh, and you guys must go through a TON of shortening for all that ""buttercream""!"
5,"Beautiful, well maintained and a nice assortment of food in the food court. Tortilla was my favorite! :)"
5,"Awesome BBQ restaurant!

I have been to Honey Bears many times and I will definitely be back. The BBQ is great and the service is good too. I recommend stopping by on a Friday for the fresh fried catfish. So good! You know the are making some crazy good food because the lines at there catering events are never ending! 

Pros
- Great fresh BBQ
- Good service
- Original tasting

Cons
- Wait times"
5,"I would be lying if I said this diner didn't influence me to move to the Garfield district. This is my absolute favorite place. I used to drive all over the valley depending on what mood I was in, and now I pretty much just go to the Welcome Diner. They have about 9 seats inside and quite a bit of patio seating. They have a few nice big outdoor heaters too.

Some things I love

-Excellent quality food sourced from local vendors
-Amazing amazing drinks. They make their own bitters, grenadine, squeeze their own lime juice  and even have fresh herbs to put in. Each one I've seen made is with love.
-Good service, fun atmosphere
-Almost everything is made from scratch
-Specials that are (always delicious) experiments, not leftovers.
-Catfish Fridays (Try the sampler!)


I would say price wise it's not necessarily cheap, but not expensive. Average plate will run you about $10, but considering the quality and atmosphere I have no problem paying it! 

Favorite dishes-
PB&B burger
Bacon Blue burger
Veggie Stallion (housemade edamame and mushroom veggie burger with housemade ricotta)
Red beans and rice with sausage
Grilled cheese on a housemade biscuit.
Try the holy puerco!"
1,"After filing my complaint on Sunday, I was told  I would receive a follow up by Monday. It is now Thursday and the company has continued to give me the runaround. I have been given multiple phone #s to call, every person I speak to makes me repeat the entire situation and then tells me to call another person. I finally got the number to who I was told was the General Manager but is actually the Fleet Manager only to get a full voicemail box. Probably filled with similar complaints..."
1,"It is old.  Walls are paper thin, it's almost like the noise from the hall and other nearby rooms is amplified.  Is that even possible?  The room did appear clean.  No security at all, just a young girl behind the front desk.  Doors to both streets wide open and vagrants milling around the openings, lounge, and lobby.

The worst part is the ""manager"".  Shortly after checking in (mid-afternoon), we decided this is not going to work.  We took our luggage back downstairs and turned in the key, leaving the room exactly as it was when we arrived.  The desk clerk called the manager, who said we would be charged one nights room + a $50 early departure fee.  We asked to speak with the manager and were told she would not talk to us.

Everyone else says this place is cheap, but a $170 charge for not even staying there seems a little pricing to me.  We are no having to dispute the charge with the CC bank."
1,"I was a member of Summit Credit Union for over 10 years, and I've always been a huge fan of credit unions... My mom had even worked for their corporate office for awhile. I had taken out a loan through them during college to help consolidate the debt I incurred from school, and a few years ago (about half way through my loan) I was laid off when the economy collapsed. I was struggling with my bills and though I had taken out the insurance for job loss, they found a loop hole and didn't credit me with the insurance, even though I had been paying the extra $50 for the insurance for over 2 years. Then I contacted them multiple times trying to reasses my monthly payment, as I couldn't keep up with all of my bills, I spoke with Mary in the finance department and through our conversation she was rude and extremely hostile. She accused me of lying when I told her I had been calling in and trying to find a solution, when I asked her if I still paid my payments but paid less, she said that they would send me to collections for not making the full amount. Then she looked in my account and saw that I had money in there (enough for only 2 months of rent and my bills... will no real income coming in) and said that there was obviously no reason I was having problems and I shouldn't have even called her. I was really frustrated, I was trying to negotiate so I didn't have to file bankruptcy. Then after I could no longer pay, due to my dire financial situation, they took out all the money I had in my account and applied it towards the loan... i.e. my rent, without any phone calls or letters reaching out to me before they were going to take my money. Ultimately, I had to file for bankruptcy, but I would never ever bank with them again."
5,I have had three things there. A hurricane (NICE) that buffalo chicken burger and a pulled pork sandwich. All were wonderful. I am dying to come back in the spring when I can sit outside!
1,"Bad attitudes from the workers, the food is not that great to put up with the mood of this place. This isn't like the soup Nazi from Seinfeld. Sometimes the place is open and sometimes it is not which makes for crappy business."
5,"I've never had a bad dish from Tolteca!  Portions are huge, but the prices are small.  Save room on the way out because their bakery is top notch!"
5,"went in for happy hour last week great drink specials and a friendly staff one bartender especially, Danny. he took great care of us and when the kitchen got behind with our order, it was packed so understandable, Danny wet above and beyond to make sure we still had a pleasant experience. we will definitely be back thanks Danny!"
5,"The best Mexican food that I've found in the valley, and absolutely worth the risk of getting shot while driving down Van Buren.  All the food I had here was incredibly fresh, delicious, and flavorful.  It seems that everything is made in-house, including the tortillas, and it shows.  Prices are great too - I got two tacos and a burrito for about $12.  I also love the huge charcoal grill in the middle of this place, although it does fill the restaurant with smoke on occasion.

What I ate:

Lengua taco - super tender and fantastic.
Carne asada taco - extremely flavorful and just really awesome.
Chile relleno burrito - a MONSTER made of delicious.  The only reason I was able to eat this and two tacos is because I'm a fatass - I'm pretty sure a normal person couldn't even finish the lone burrito.

I also tried a bite of someone else's fish taco and it was awesome.  Most places deep-fry their fish for tacos, but La Tolteca grills it, which gives a different flavor and texture that is absolutely fantastic.

The salsas are also really fresh and delicious.  Even though I prefer spicier food, the mild salsa verde was very flavorful and delicious.  The salsa habanera had a good kick to it and satisfied my craving for something hot.

La Tolteca is awesome, and it's unfortunate that I didn't find it until after I moved out of Phoenix.  I'll be sure to stop by every time I visit though, as this place is worth it."
5,"I never thought I would feel so passionately about my accountants. But finding myself part owner of a small business, I can say these wonderful people have changed my life for the better, again and again by being so supportive, responsive and helpful. They answer questions quickly; they explain things well; they do a wonderful job, and they are really fantastic human beings. We work with Sarah and Brianne, and I can't recommend them enough."
1,"Way too many fucking issues.   Lets start with the customer service when you call for a cab.  Unprofessional, talk in slang.  I called for a cab and then got a call telling me my cab was there, went downstairs never saw the cab.   Called the taxi service number and they kept insisting that i was the idiot n said well the cab is there waiting for you.  Puts me on hold and tells me 5 minutes later to tell them what im wearing.  I said a black shirt and why is that relevant.  Lady says quietly we're going to send another cab.    I said another cab? There wasnt ever a first one.  She insisted yea there was until she finally admits 30 seconds later yea sorry he wasnt there.  How the fuck can u call me to tell me my cab is waiting downstairs when they werent ever there.     

Now my actual can driver.  First thing he asks can u pay cash? I said sorry i only have card, then he goes, "" can we stop by atm?""   I said no because im already late enough because of your company.  I know its not your fault but i need to get to te tempe campus for a meeting.    Thia fucker still asks to stop at the atm cause its 2 blocks away.   He doesnt fucking understand i dont have time.   Then asks for directions to tempe campus.  Idiot gets lost and asks to borrow my phone as gps. 

Fucking whack."
5,"Cozy and Comfy. We were shuttled to and from the airport and to Epic. Convenient to a small shopping center and nearby restaurants. Staff are friendly and professional. Each day I came back to a clean room and replenished towels, shampoo, soap and 2 pieces of chocolates. Thanks Esther! :)"
5,"So, this Phoenix institution is not gonna win any awards for its food.  There are a whole lotta other reasons why we go here.  It feels like your grandma's place and my kids love it.  I've been going there for nearly 40 years.  The food is dependable and tasty and the cost is very reasonable.  Know that you are always going to wait in the lobby, even if there are several table available.  It's a good tactic."
1,"This Goodwill is a disgusting, stinky, disorganized, picked over mess.  I have never found something that was even worth the trip here.  


Skip this one and go to the one at 16th Street and Indian School Road.  

Trust me, you'll thank me later."
5,Great old-school barber shop. I'm in and out in 20 minutes and the price is right. Ka and Lisa both do a great job every time.
5,"I'm originally from the Pacific Northwest, so I'm really picky about Asian food.  Wild Thaiger is fantastic, mostly authentic, Thai food.  For the less adventurous, the pad thai is delicious and unlike what you get at most Thai restaurants in the valley.  For those with a more adventurous palate, the Pad Cha seafood dish is spectacular.  Be careful if you order Thai hot..they mean business here.  The desserts are also fantastic.  For the best service, check it out for lunch on a weekday.  Service can be a little slow for dinner, but still good."
5,Can't complain! Definitely a nice place to drink while you wait for your table next door.
1,"My husband and I are new to Phoenix and have decided to try as many local places as possible. Intrigued by the outside decor, we ventured into this odd place. We ordered 2 meals and sat at a greasy, dirty table. 
Our wings and burger arrived and we were thoroughly disappointed. The wings (some spicy ranch and some garlic Parmesan) were soggy from the grease and extra chewy. The burger appeared to have been  put in the fryer with the wings. The bun was soggy and the patty doused in pepper. 
They did try to make their greasy food healthier by handing out sandwich bags with carrots and ranch. Good effort. 
The one star it gets is for decor and fries. The fries are great, just covered in salt (shake then it off and they will be fine.) The decor will keep you entertained and avoid awkward silences."
1,"Paradise?!  Absolutely not!   This place is a joke.   We've gone here a few times and each time confirms the bad experience preceding.   This place just does not serve up what their name implies.
When I go to a place called Cheeseburger in Paradise I expect something above and beyond the regular burger down the street.  Instead, all they serve up here is hamburgers with fancy names.   Every burger I have ever ordered here has been lesser than any burger at any  greasy spoon or family restaurant.   
I was hoping they would have some steak fries instead of the usual basic fries.  Nope.   The burgers are just that, basic burgers with a sauce to match the fancy name.   What chef dreamed up these recipes?   I doubt it was a chef.  Probably some person that said, ""good enough, let's go make some money"".
Our burgers yesterday were about 10 bucks each and just basic burgers that should have cost about 4 bucks.   The meat didn't have any distinctive flavor and was rather skimpy, the sauce was not complimentary to the sandwich and the bun was generally regular too.   At least the bun was fresh.  
I would only recommend this place to my Republican friends because they have no ability to think for themselves anyway and might actually like the place.
If you're looking for paradise you won't find it here.  Last best burger I had was at Great Dane, maybe try there.   But I have had lame burgers there too.  Let me think, ummm,  
If you are still reading.... DON'T GO HERE.  Look elsewhere."
5,The Jambalaya is better than I've had in New Orleans. New Orleans Take out is one of the best values in the city. Can't say enough about it.
5,This is a really well done garden. Truly spectacular.
5,"Fantastic, got a Hot Soup Tom gun going I believe, very tasty, ended with some fantastic Thai ice coffee and average coconut ice cream, ask for Fawn, she is very attentative and sweet"
1,"Let's start with this; my waiter was a 30 year old guy with eyeliner caked on. Okay... that's it, you can find a better place to have a drink."
1,I see that all the negative reviews for this business have been flagged. To those thinking of trying this establishment: READ THE FLAGGED REVIEWS. You will have a far more balanced and accurate assessment.
1,"So my bf and I wanted a drink and snacks since it was happy hour at 2 we went and we were in a bit of a hurry cause my bf had to go to work at 3 so it just turned 2 so we weren't really in a rush since we THOUGHT they would give us our meal in 5 min NOPE we pull up,press the red button it lights up......nothing we do it again...nothing. People next to is pulled up and ordered already. So we back out and go into another menu same thing waited about 2 min then they finally answered I asked is one of you menu broken? They said nope. So I told them what happens and we been waiting for 5-8 mins for someone to answer then they said o yeah one of the menus is broken. So I'm like alright and we ordered room about 15 min till our order came and that's when we were in a rush. Another time my bf ordered chili cheese fries they gave him what looked/tasted like plastic cold cheese fries and my strawberry limeade had way to many strawberry chunks in it I felt like I didn't even drunk anything mostly ate the strawberries and could really taste some syrup Idk it was too sweet! They need to retrain or idk but they been messing up a lot. Not gonna go here again"
5,Love this place.
5,Really efficient denny's! Great in a pinch.
5,"I was completely skeptical about Phoenix Ranch Market when my wife said we were going to go check it out last week, so skeptical that I told her I didn't want to go, in all honesty... what could possibly be so good about a little grocery store in a not particularly good part of downtown Phoenix after all? EVERYTHING. Prices lower than Walmart, the largest selection of 89 cent pastries I've ever seen, several small ""restaurants"", full cows heads for only 49.99, a vast selection of specialty items most grocery stores don't carry much of (Hispanic stuff, fruits, vegetables), plus, it's probably the most clean grocery store I've ever been in. While we don't live close enough to make this our go-to grocery store, I can guarantee you'll see us here several times a month from now on. Five big fat ones for sure."
5,"This place is great! Use to eat at it maybe 4 times a week! I use to work at the record store next door and me and the guys would always order breakfast & lunch. George, the owner was a great friendly guy always took care of us next door. It's a great family operated business with great service and delicious food."
1,"I or someone I have been with has gotten food poisoning 3 times from this grocery/pizzeria.  That's 3 separate occasions, I have stopped going here at all!"
1,Got a call from the General Manager John who was very nice and assured me they are not a homeless shelter. Perhaps I will go back and try them again.
5,Best Philly cheesesteak in town!
1,"I bought a new Dyson DC-50 vacuum. I found it 10 days for $120 less at another shop in Madison so I called to ask if they would do anything to help me out. I was out of the 7 day return/exchange window, and spoke to a guy at the Odana Rd. location and he told me I had to call the owner of the store.

I called the owner and left 4 messages over a 2 week span and never received a call back. I would never do business with this company again.

Overall, a very disappointing experience."
1,"While the beans are tasty as other reviewers have said (they use lard in them; mmm mmm!) and the portion sizes generous, I just can't recommend you eat here based on the fact I found out they fry their nachos, and probably by extension other things using the fryer, in hydrogenated oil. You can ""feel"" it on the nachos, as they have a waxy coating when cooled.

I know not everyone knows or perhaps cares about the deathly spectre of hydro-oils (most commonly referred to as trans fats), but believe me: they're highly dangerous.

It's a damn shame, too, as most of the offerings at this place seem solid and they even have three-person mariachi bands at the ready to serenade you. In my short time in PHX, this looked like it was going to be the best Mexican place I had found yet. Oh well, back to the drawing board."
1,This review is solely about volunteering here. They do not return phone calls or emails. They treat people that want to volunteer their time horribly! On facebook former volunteers/vanguards are always complaining. Sojourner Center should start treating better those willing to work for free! This is a disgrace. The horror stories that i heard and my personal experience of not even treated as a person that should have emails returned is just unbelievable. Want to volunteer? Look elsewhere.
5,Matt at Bennett's Auto is very knowledgable and skilled with BMW's. I brought my car in and he was able to replace the belt along with my driver-side mirror fixed at the perfect timing and good price. I plan on bringing it back to have my breaks and other things done in the future. I highly recommend Bennett's to anyone who needs work done on your BMW.
1,"Lost my paperwork multiple times. Lost my DD214 which they were supposed to return after processing. Refused to take action on claim, until I had sent multiple letters to congress about claim."
5,"The men here have always taken care of my car, which is now getting up there in age. They're patient and always willing to explain what services will be done to my car and give me a fair price. They're not the cheapest in town but they do high quality work. Even when I had to have work done at another shop they called and had the details of the work faxed over to double check and ensure that everything was done properly."
5,Burgundy Pepper Steak. Get one of these and you will understand why 5 stars isn't nearly enough! So good!
5,Went to eat in by myself at lunch.  Tried the panko chicken with tonkatsu sauce.  YUM!  Mama san stopped by and drop off the real verison of asian tonkatsu sauce.  WOW!  It was much better.  BYW - tonkatsu = japanese BBQ sauce...  Can not wait to go back soon!
1,"It's 2005 and I was referred to my normal dentist to Reed for some extra teeth that were under my gum line.  Nothing really affected me but Reed suggested that he remove 3 wisdom teeth and 2 extra teeth below my gum line on my right lower side of my jaw.  So a total of 5 teeth.

Little did I know he was going to CUT AWAY my gum line and expose the roots of my existing teeth that were FINE. 

He claimed it would be fine and the gums would grow back, they never did. The exposed sections of the roots caused infection in my gums and I lost a molar and am probably going to lose another one this year.  

I haven't been able to chew solid food on the right side of my mouth for the past 9 years.  ridiculous. 

I'm currently looking for an oral surgeon to hopefully rectify this HACK JOB that Reed left me with nearly 9 years ago.  Every day of my life I regret going to Reed and after showing the results to my regular dentist, he stopped referring patients to Reed.

Even the desk attendants were pushy about the surgery saying I should have them all removed in one session vs having them done in two sessions.  Clearly this office is money hungry and they don't care about the patient's well being post surgery."
5,"I have had some good digestive experiences here. 

Also, I have kin who works here... so that's another incentive for you to step in."
1,"A heaping scoop of cold mashed potatoes slathered with LAME sauce is how I would classify this dinner!

I've read some of the other reviews on this particular establishment, and will agree with the one that says that businesses sometimes have bad days.  It would appear that this business is having more than their fair share these days.

There were 5 of us, including one fairly easy to please 10 year old.  First it took the server the better part of a half an hour to acknowledge that we were sitting on the patio in high 80 degree weather with no beverages.... IN THE DESERT!!!  C'mon.  Once we ordered I just assumed that everything would remedy itself.  It was only the beginning.

When the food was delivered (along with the appetizer that we ordered) it was cold and not even close to what we ordered.  Picture it... a ""hot"" roast beef open faced sandwich, which I asked for a substitution of french fries for the mashed potatoes (not a major request) and the bread was cold and soggy because it sat in the window forever.  When I asked to have it made to it's menu specifications AKA HOT, they took it back and threw it in the microwave and returned the plate to me as I sent it back to the kitchen.  How do I know that?  Well, you know what happens when you put bread in the microwave?  It's gets hard and stale, a texture that once you experience you won't soon forget.

When we told the waitress that ""tonight isn't a good night for us here I guess"".  Her response was ""It is for me too"".  Server Rule #1 - NEVER MAKE YOUR PROBLEM, THEIR PROBLEM!

Enter the ""Manager"".  I do have to give points for the manager standing in front of us and taking her lumps.  I have to take away points for never making an offer to take anything off the bill.  You have to remember that I sent my food back and declined an offer for anything else.

If any of the restaurant staff reads this review, please take one thing away from it... You can work wonders by L-I-S-T-E-N-I-N-G and NOT MAKING EXCUSES!!  If the kitchen truly was the problem, they needed to step it up!!  If the waitress couldn't handle the number of people she was waiting on, you should have replaced her or reduced her section.  I only say this because we noted that she was waiting on a huge party of 15 people, us and several others (and I don't think she was experienced enough to even handle two tables).

Ready for dessert?  One of the waitresses was wearing a cute black skirt uniform dress.  Apparently she was having issues with her shoes or socks because she bent over to readjust them.  I bet you know what's coming next.... What's rule #1 when wearing a skirt ladies??  Don't bend over in your skirt when your standing three steps above the people below you, because they will surely see whatch-yo Mama gave ya!!

In closing, do I think this was meant to be four star dining? NO.  Do I think that we deserved as much attention as anyone else there tonight? ABSOLUTELY.  Did we catch them on a bad night?  PROBABLY.  Will I go back and give them a second and final opportunity to improve upon this bad experience?  YOU BETCHYA!!

Good luck here, and I hope your experience is better than ours was."
1,"Instead of a review, here is the letter I wrote AJs about my experience in their store. They NEVER responded,  and now I can no longer, in good conscience,  shop there because of their apathy.

""I'm writing, because I had an experience at your store that I just can't stop thinking about. I visited last Sunday, Oct. 30th- close to closing time. As I was checking out, the cashier (a younger man- he looked like he might be of Latino decent) was incredibly polite and professional. However, I had a very negative/offensive experience with another employee of your store that appeared to have just finished her shift and was waiting in line behind me to make a purchase (she was a middle aged woman, with dyed blond hair and heavy eye make-up). As my friend and I were making our purchase, we briefly chatted with the kind cashier. I, in error, went to the wrong place to check out. Your cashier made a friendly comment about how at Costco they have arrows to guide people and that it was an easy mistake for me to go to the wrong spot. It was just friendly rapport. I suppose he was trying to ease my mind in case I felt embarrassed, which I appreciated the gesture. 

Anyhow, while he was talking with my friend and myself, the woman interrupts and starts loudly saying to the cashier helping us, and I am QUOTING her, ""Not MY Costco, you live with 'needy' people! You go to the 'needy' people Costco. My Costco is beautiful because there aren't any 'needy' people there. I live in a different city than YOU. I don't live amongst 'needy' people. We're not needy where I live like YOUR city"". 

Sadly, I am not exaggerating this in anyway. I was completely appalled by the lack of  basic manners. 

This woman is completely unprofessional. Regardless of her personal feelings towards wherever the young man lives or her delusional superiority over ""needy"" people... laughable, since she is working at a grocery store but that's beside the point. I can not believe she would have the audacity to speak to this young man in this manner in front of CUSTOMERS. 

Despite her rude, insensitive and unprofessional comments, the young man remained gracious and kind and never said and unkind word or even gave an unkind glance while this woman was attempting to belittle and humiliate him in front of customers. She is lucky that I was too shocked by her behavior to say something at the time, because I am and was completely disgusted. This has left a lasting impression, a negative one to say the least, and I certainly hope that you have a talk with this woman about basic manners and conduct- even if I wasn't present- her behavior is basically harassment and no person should have to deal with such ignorance and insensitivity."""
1,Worst Mexican disaster to hit planet mid town. Sloppy burrito fold gooey cheese processed beans. Restaurant unauthentic. Unfriendly staff.
5,"I like this venue a lot. It's huge and there is tons of seating, so it's a really amped up experience.

I have seen Justin Timberlake here and the Backstreet Boys back in the day. Both shows were great with awesome pyrotechnics, stage displays and stunts."
1,"Awful service! Mediocre food... if it was what I ordered. The beer was OK but nothing great compared to other breweries around town. I really wanted to like this place, sadly disappointed. No one helped us when we walked in (they weren't busy) and our server kept forgetting about us to chat with dudes at the bar. When she messed up on our food she wasn't very graceful about it... and we still had to pay full price. It also took almost two hours, and we didn't make it to the plans we had afterward. It wasn't just our servers that was bad, the bartender was rude and so was another server. Won't go back... the owners really need to step in!"
5,"Probably THE best place to get cigars in the area. I've only been here twice, but I will definitely be going here again soon. They know their stuff and are very helpful. After a short chat about what types of cigars I've had the recommendations came flowing. There's a huge selection, so if you do know what you're looking for they will probably have it."
1,"Updating my review after a horrible experience trying to utilize their private room, Rendevous, for a birthday dinner.  Their event coordinator dropped the ball with several huge miscommunications during the 4 weeks we were in touch, and then went MIA for a week and a half before the event.  In the 11th hour, three days before the event and ON my actual birthday, I had to pull the event when there was no way to find a mutually-agreed upon solution that would preserve the original intent of the evening.  I had to inform my 27 guests of the last-minute location change via e-mail after sending formal invitations weeks in advance. 

The entire experience was a nightmare and having the owner yelling at me on my birthday was not the highlight of my week.  The most unprofessional and offensive experience I have ever had within the service industry."
5,"I've never been disappointed.
I know three members, all superb artists.
I wish to be a member some day.
Sigh."
1,Had to call the police to get a refund for my food we waited 15 minutes the food did not come. I asked for a refund they reefused so I had to call the police when the police got there they gave me my refund I have never had to call the police on any kind of establishment before.NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO HERE!!
1,"Stay away from this hooters. Bad food, bad service. Bleh!"
1,This is the story me and my family where sited  outside we have waited 22 minutes to be exact and we did not get serves the beast part is that after 16 minutes I talked to the hostess and still no one showed up
1,"This place is highly overrated; while the food is a nice change from Taco Bell, it is sincerely OVERPRICED.  Good but not great and certainly not at that price.  Chico's owners have delusions of grandeur.  

I ordered 3 tacos and the price was $7.50; I should have said ""never mind"", but I was too stunned to think clearly.  Next time I'll read the menu and prices more closely.  My bad.  The tacos are practically ""bite-size"", anyone can finish it off in 3 - really.  

I should have known something was up because it was the height of lunch time and it was nowhere near full.  I didn't expect Taco Bell prices, but neither did I expect to be gouged.

Save your money for Mi Patio; their tacos are 4.25, but they are 3x the size Chico's.   Filiberto's is even better - their shredded beef taco is also ""full""and is only $2.06.

What a rip-off."
5,One of the best Thai restaurants. Mahi Mahi Prig Pao is the best Thai dishes ever. Pad Thai was good. Lettuce rolls so-so.
5,I had so much fun at NU last night! There was an live auction where you could bid on pieces created by the Crafty Chica (Kathy Murillo). Participation was free and you got a vial of Crafty Chica glitter and a glitterific auction paddle just for registering! My favorite part of the night was watching a lady outbid herself (3x) to win the Glitter Bull Dog..lol. Best of all proceeds went to benefit Valle del Sol. NU is by far my favorite event at the Heard!
5,"This is a great restaurant to go to in a charming neighborhood. Gramma in town? Take her, she loves home cooking! Post Critical Mass carbo load? Wheel on in! Conservative couple on 
the third date and need to fuel up before doing it for the first time? Jackpot! As a bonus: With it's proximity to the storied Barrymore Theater, it is not uncommon to dine amongst musical geniusii. 
Diner-esque feel and fare with lots of visual distractions (you may need them for the inevitable wait) You will more than likely hear screams of ecstasy after someone has the pie. Comfort food for the masses (Yes, you too my veggie sucking pals!) 

Hmmmmmmm. Do you like the idea good-looking salt of the Earth houseboys? Well, whomever does the hiring at Monte's does too. I have not seen one unattractive employee yet. Besides being beautiful, they are efficient in their positions. The waitstaff is friendly and quick, cooks have yet to fail my taste buds, and the bakers make some of the yummiest cakes in the state. 

For maximum food coma-ry, I'd recommend the (fake)meatloaf w/cashew gravy, mashed potatoes, a mimosa chased with a piece of Fat Elvis cake. Remember you are in Wisconsin and you don't have to have any regard for caloric intakes any longer, and eat til you either pass out or essplode,no judgment. In fact the fake meatloaf/cashew gravy is so fabulous, that I have 
sent a mole into the kitchens of Monte's to snag the recipe. Yes, I am that powerful/desperate."
1,"Never again will I shop this store!  I have been an extremely loyal customer for well over 5 years.  Several weeks ago I made a very large purchase of many items in order to make a scrapbook for my daughter's bridal shower.  During the course of that shopping experience, an associate kindly offered to keep my selections at the checkout desk while I continued to shop; however, inadvertently another associate also added another customer's purchases to my pile as well, which I did not discover until a few days ago when I proceeded to put together the scrapbook.  When I attempted to return about $20 worth of merchandise that I had paid for but had not selected, I was told I was past their 30-day policy and I was simply out of luck. I later discovered, however, that I had returned these items WITHOUT a receipt, I would have been given a store credit--which I had expressly requested but been denied because I was careful enough to save my receipt!  Nope...no more of my business and I'm telling my story to every woman I know!"
1,"I ate here last week,  this was my first time to Fat Jack's and likely the last. The place is quite dingy and has this layer of dusty grime on everything, it is in need of one of those restaurant makeover shows. The wait staff was friendly but unprofessional and somewhat inattentive given that there were few other people there at the time. It is a windowless, dark, cave atmosphere and dimly lit. 

My food was Just OK and for a $10 sandwich they could have done allot better, it had zero flavor, but they provide home made BBQ sauces in those on-table, refillable squeeze bottles that never see a fridge or dishwasher. This place is in need of some serious updating in ALL areas."
1,"still, the #1 WORST store ever!  At this point, I'd pay to have F&E, Fry's, or Food City move into the neighborhood.
they wait until the entire front of the store is completely clogged before they even call for another cashier.  then, they have to call 3 or 4 times before someone bothers to show up.
with chicken heads in Organic chicken, cockroaches in Organic salad, LONG lines, pan handlers & girl scouts in the parking lot, and poor customer service, i'm surprised someone hasn't moved in to the territory.  this store is a text book cluster f**k.
#worstgrocerystore"
5,"Good service and location, food is great too!"
5,"My favorite Madison clothing store by far.  I coveted a pair of gold shoes they had over Christmas ($135!)  and managed to save enough to buy them....totally worth it!!  They are italian leather and SO beautiful.  Everything else in the store is the same way....it makes me wish I had unlimited funds and could get one of everything.  The guys clothing is fantastic too, although getting your boyfriend to shell out that kind of money to look ""metrosexual"" is sometimes a challenge. Something nice to keep in mind as well is that they have free alterations on non-sale clothing....I had a pair of jeans done and they actually put the detailing around the bottom back on....AMAZING!  5 stars."
5,"I've been here twice with my girlfriends and every time I've ordered the same thing...b/c it's delicious!  The crab dip is cheesy and delicious on top of their citrus tortilla chips and the Farm Salad is worth every penny (especially with the chicken).  

I am excited to bring the rest of my family to this cute little place...my favorite little place...on the corner!"
1,"Is there a way to give zero stars?? 
I was waiting in a long line for a taxi home from Phx Sky Harbor. When I finally was given a cab I asked if they took credit. The cab driver said if he had to he could but asked if I would be willing to go to an ATM for cash. I explained after a trip all I had was a credit card and he went on to complain about how he was going to get paid less if I used credit.

Okay, that's annoying but hardly the beginning of it. I live about 2 miles from the airport. The driver kept his meter covered by paper. When I asked why, he said I'd be paying $16, which was the minimum. I asked why the sign said the min. was 15, and he said if I was going to argue he'd leave me there at the side of the road...  Well, I wasn't arguing to begin with, but that was enough for me to shut up. I was a girl alone in a cab and pretty intimidated. 

I sent my friend a txt trying to explain my situation and he called back to keep me on the phone so I could continuously update him on my location in case the driver decided to be any crazier. Once I was at my destination I decided it would be best for the driver to drop me at the front of my complex so he wouldn't know exactly where I lived. He used a carbon copy device to get my card # and handed me the receipt to sign without giving my card back. I scribbled in a $2 tip worried that he was going to give me a hard time about giving me my card back or allowing me to access my suitcase in the trunk. The driver was completely intimidating the entire time and insisted I leave a phone number with him before he would return my card to me. 

When I got to my apt, I called the company to complain. The first person I spoke to was very understanding and apologetic for my experience. She took down my acct and said she'd put it through to the road supervisor who would have to do the follow-up. She promised the my information could stay anonymous from the driver upon my request.

About an hour later, at nearly 10pm, the supervisor called and asked me to repeat the situation to him. He said he NOT able to keep my information anonymous. That he would deal with the driver tonight to hear his side of the ""story"". That if I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy that I would have to contact the police. 

Absolutely one of the worst cab companies imaginable. I cannot believe any business can successfully run like this. I will go out of my way to never use them again."
1,"I am redoing this review. 
Before I gave them 1 star because of the staff. Well let me continue with my dissatisfaction. If I could give them ZERO STARS I would easily. 
My dryer HAS NOT WORKED since I moved in. After having maitnence come out MULTIPLE TIMES they are still saying there is nothing wrong with it. They can and will get you in trouble for anything. Makes me feel like they're ""big brother"" watching over you. 
So many people I have talked to are having similar issues. There are so many empty apartments due to the fact that this is A TERRIBLE COMPLEX. yes it may look good from the outside. Just don't wait until you live here for months. It only gets worse.
They have issues with the LEASE. My lease started July 1st. Now they are saying I cannot get out of my lease until JULY 31st!!!
That is 13 months when I signed a 12 MONTH LEASE.
Awful awful awful place to live."
5,"i love this place! after dealing with petedge ryans pet has now officially became our main wholesale place! high five!

their repair center is awesome. their prices are great! and well they are awesome in every way! can't complain much.. here!"
1,"I stumbled across this place when I heard 'chile' for the name of this est.. Well, to cut this short; I am a spicy fave type of guy. I didnt experience any 'CHILE let alone some black pepper for my black pepper chicken.  Had i wanted some dry chicken calamari imposture whatever it was I wouldve payed for the real thing, this est. upset me and I threw it, what they tried to feed me, in the trash. THIS PLACE WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. Even if they dared try to redeem what happened."
5,"How do you give this place less than five stars? Olbrich is a free botanical garden! Sure, the growing season here is very limited (even Milwaukee and Chicago have longer seasons!), but that is no reason to detract a star from a place because of the weather! 

This place is gorgeous and the flora/fauna you might be inclined to visit depends on the time of year...the Thai Pavilion is probably the exception as the gold leaf and smooth stones stand out at anytime of year. (Did you know there are no nails in the entire structure? I think that is so amazing!) 

The Bolz Conservatory is also open year round. It includes tropical plants as well as many species of smaller creatures be them mammal, bird, or butterfly. While the Gardens in Chicago or Domes in Milwaukee might run you a pretty penny, the Conservatory costs only $2. The gigantic koi, the exotic trees, and not even to mention being the cheapest sauna in Wisconsin! This place is so worth it! I adore it and still pickup the 'kids-only' scavenger hunt.

Everything about this place is delightful. Also, I have navigated this place, with the exception of the rock garden, with a wheelchair. So for those concerned about others who cannot walk far or without assistance, there are many benches and areas for a rest! Did I mention that it is free? (Although I always toss in something because I never want to see the day Olbrich Gardens closes its doors to the community due to lack of funds.)"
1,Crappy customer service.  I was the only minority in the store the whole time (wearing Ann Taylor clothes I had previously purchased at other stores) and these biotches followed me around like I was going to steal something.
5,"For $6 after tax I got a medium drink and 2 huge slices of fresh pizza and this has to be one of the best slices of cheese pizza I've ever eaten! You can taste the herbs, the crust is perfect and it's an AWESOME value!!! Will definitely be going back!"
5,"I cannot speak highly enough of this restaurant. The chips are to die for, the salads and tortilla soup were awesome. To top it off, the service by our waitress TJ (Tammy J) was excellent as she made us feel like guests in her own home. We'll go back again anytime we visit Phoenix."
1,"I stayed at this hotel the second week of March 2014. A colleague and I both ended up with BED BUG BITES!! The hotel representatives we spoke with were rude and accusatory. They acted like we were trying to get away with something. REALLY?!? They refused to check our crews rooms for pests. They completely denied any responsibility and offered no help to us. I travel most of the year as my job requires. By far one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. I would post photos of the bites on my FACE, but being humiliated at work for a week was bad enough."
5,"Love!   We will be back, and back often.  As our summer Saturday dining trek continues this is the epitome of what we want.  A local joint, that just makes you comfortable and glad to be out.

Arrived about 6:30 on a Saturday, and found our way to the new back patio.  A couple of larger groups, but plenty of choice of seating.  Found our table, and service was immediate-friendly, attentive, and just exceptional.  KR had barely ordered and couldn't stop gushing about her love of this place.  
We started with the fried pickles, based on previous reviews, and they were perfectly done.
KR had the Rooster sandwich and enjoyed it so much, she only offered me a tiny bite, As I'm unable to order the same, I was forced to the Tip Top burger, and was not disappointed.  Perfectly done, and flavor throughout.
After another beverage, and just enjoying the evening, we got our check and headed out.
Thanks to other reviews, we knew CASH only, but there is an ATm, so heads up!

Perfect, exactly what we wanted, and this sets the bar for us for the balance of our summer Saturday dining trek."
1,"I must say I don't know what the bartenders problem was that night, but he was nothing but attitude and a egotistical punk. I have never been treated so poorly in a nice establishment, so if you go to Merc Bar be sure to avoid BRENT...not worth your time."
5,"Very good meats,they will make you lunch if you like and the best Russian Red Crab I have picked up in my life. ...and GREAT SERVICE"
1,"I went there less than an hour ago- they are lucky I didn't go to a manager. I'm sitting there waiting to be called, and after 45 minutes I went out to find my car. Turns out they never called me and had parked my car in the parking lot. Took too long to track down my keys, and then the guy follows over pretty much wanting the ""tip"". I look at my car and there's spots everywhere, the paint is scratched all over and it was obvious they hadn't bothered to get the soap off, vacuum properly, or even clean at all. Wiped my hand over the dash and came back with more dust than I had gone in with!!


Overall, if I could give even less stars they would get it. Absolutely terrible!"
5,Our wedding was gorgeous and people loved the venue.  Riette responded quickly to all of our questions and was wonderful about accommodating our needs.
1,Customer service was horrible. They lost a $700 sale because the Guy behind the counter was a dick.
5,"This place is fantastic! 
I got toys for my pup for less than half of what they cost in a pet supermarket. I also picked up some supplements, bowls and toothpaste for unbelievable prices. 
You must purchase a minimum of $25.00 worth of goodies, but it is well worth it. Your dollar really goes far here! 
I will be back soon and will bring Bronco with me so he can pick his favorite things. 
Thanks Ryans!"
1,"Awful awful awful, cliff notes version / African pharmacist who's name I missed refused to fill script after telling me day before all I needed was my doctor to call in, which he did/ flat out nasty and rude/"
1,"I hate to give a 1-star review, but Manuel's earned it. Having lived in Albuquerque for six years, I know how a chile relleno should look when it arrives at the table. Manuel's batter was heavy on the egg and what we found on the plate was, unfortunately, an omelet with green chile. Disgusting."
5,"Every time I've been to Wild Thaiger the food has been amazing, and last night was no different. My friend and I went to check out the ""Wine Down Wednesday"" special, which means you can get any international wines for only $5 per glass (this is a great deal as they have some pretty awesome wines). 

As for food last night, we shared an app and entree. We started with the Island Crab, which is a crispy shell with crab meat on top - like a deconstructed wonton type of thing, only better! I love the fact that you can see and taste huge delicious chunks of crab, instead of the typical 95% cream cheese filling in most crab wontons. Awesome. For our 'entree' we had a special for the evening that was Thai Sausage and vegetables. It was yummy, and I was even afraid to 'dive in' because the presentation was gorgeous! 

In previous experiences here I've had Pad Thai, Holy Basil Chicken, Peanut Passion and Beef Mangone. All of them were awesome, beautifully presented and my personal favorite... tasted FRESH! I love that every time I've been here the food has been consistently awesome. Fresh flavors, enough spice to taste (you can pick your level on most items), great flavor combos without going overboard - I like that you can taste all the different ingredients instead of having them masked by one or two overpowering flavors. 

Last night I had the privilege of meeting the owner, Olashawn. She's an awesome woman with a passion for what she does, and one of the most down-to-earth people I've ever met. If you go in, make sure to give her a wave, you'll see her behind the counter and behind the line, cooking and working just as hard if not harder then everyone else."
1,"The last time will be the last time. 
Yesterday at CF, waiter was passable. He did not offer to bring a glass with the beer, and did not do so until asked. 
Food and drinks were good. 
However, at end of meal a waitress from another table dropped/spilled a tray of drinks on the left side of my husband who is in a wheelchair with electric wheels. Husband's left side including wheels and batteries were drenched. Waitress did not initially apologize but stated, ""It's just a spill."" We asked several times for a wet cloth to wipe off sticky soda from husband, shirt, wheelchair and wheels. We moved to the next table to finish meal and to get out of the large puddle. 
The manager came over after several minutes and offered to pay for dry cleaning; then the waitress said she was sorry. No comp, no apology until we cleaned up ourselves. 

Even worse; two years ago a waiter dropped a tray of drinks on my son at the same place,and another customer who was sitting at a table next to us was also drenched. 
This was weird deja vu.  

Maybe CF has a policy that waitstaff have to carry as many drinks as possible, and they don't know their limit until they exceed it. Ha. 
Overall, food was good and service was sub par. Attitude was LOUSY! 
The customer who is paying about $25.00 per person ought to be treated as a guest and with courtesy. 

Better luck when seated at the bar, on past visits. No spillage."
5,"This place is AMAZING!!
I've had the falafel wrap, Monty's Blue Plate Burger with the walnut burger and tempeh bacon and both were fabulous!!!  I had to narrow my options down to my top 6 choices before ordering... I will go back many more times so I can try everything I want to order!!
And oh my gosh the pies!!  Fat Elvis (banana cake, peanut butter frosting filling and chocolate frosting) and Drumstick (Peanut butter silk pie with a fudge layer in the bottom) were both delicious!  
The staff is also very nice, helpful and passionate."
5,"Food is insanely good.  Fresh meats and very, very tasty.  When you order a sandwich (i recommend the godfather I or II), the owner goes to the fridge and begins slicing cuts for your sub.  Doesn't get much fresher than that.  They have a few tables, but I've never eaten there so I cannot comment on the service but they are always friendly when I order take out.  In addition to a plethora of sandwich options there are italian dishes as well.  I've had the lasagna which was a large, flavorful portion.  Desserts are great too.  Try a Cannoli."
1,"If I could give no stars, I would have. Coming from Texas, this place is a disappointment. It just sucks. They have real Mexican's working for them, yet they can't even make an even tortilla. They are always puffy, misshapen, to thick etc. Most of the food comes out cold and doesn't even make sense. Disgusting!"
1,"Let me start by saying we've been here befor and had good experiences but this was the Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, I was told the wait was 35 to 40 min... an hour later I asked when we would be sat and I was greeted with three girls and nothing but attitude. When I asked why people who came in after us were served I was told that they were either ""friends"" or investors.  20 min later I approached them again noticing that nearly everyone that came in after me had been sat. I was told that they called us which was a blatant lie because where we were waiting the intercom was so loud it made my granddaughter scared every time they used it. Come to find out when we asked the first time how long the wait would be they put a mark next to our name which made them believe they called our name when they had not...genius!  When they figured out their mistake all I teceived was attitude and NO apology. So we asked to see the manager, it's been an hour and a half by now...we have no choice but to wait because this is the only place near by. We finally get a table and the waitress is a doll, she is great! They send up the manager...lo and behold it's the bartender NOT the manager...This place is one giant joke. The food was dry and the employees horrible!"
1,"This place is always packed; however, the increased popularity is working against it. I took my mother, step father, and fellow siblings here for Mother's day. It took fifteen minutes just to get the attention of the waitress. When the food finally arrived three out of five of the orders were completely wrong. The waitress basically just negotiated back and forth with us until we agreed to eat what we were served. 

On a side note, the owner (older lady) kept staring at our table with a look in her eye that could have gotten her a role in the movie Scarface.

Unfortunately, the owners no longer care about quality like they did before the business burnt down. It's just a numbers thing at this point.

They lost a lifer that day."
5,"I may be a little biased since I've grown up on these ribs but damn it if these aren't great ribs I have no clue what are.  Got off the plane and the first thing on my mind is ribs.  It's right next to the airport.  Even if you are there for a layover just take a cab up the street and get yourself a full slab of pork ribs with two sides for only 20 bucks.  That's enough food for 3 people folks.  If you ain't keen on sharing with your nasty, always sick, finger licking companion(s) then they have individual meals too.  The meat is fall off the bone tender and juicy.  The bbq sauce is what I judge other sauces by.  It's vinegary and a little sweet and a whole lot of flavor.  If you are in Madison and you  crave ribs then this is the only place you should think of."
1,"I just deleted a huge diatribe that I started writing here in favor of keeping this short & to the point: 
1 -- Dr. Day comes off as cold, arrogant and I didn't get the slightest sense that he wanted to do anything more for me than submit my insurance claim and get money.  
2 -- His staff is short, rude, and seemingly bothered by patients as opposed to wanting to help them.  

I will never return to this office and I will never recommend Dr. Day or his staff to anyone.

If you need oral surgery, call Perfect Teeth (see my review) and ask for a caring professional like Dr. Salb."
1,"Drinks are weak & from a mix, food is less then desirable & the waitress we got is so cranky that even my spanish speaking friends couldn't get her to crack a smile! skip this joint!"
1,"I started shopping at Buffalo Exchange over 30 years ago, and their offerings have gotten worse over time.  They used to have an outstanding selection of vintage clothing, and now it seems there is a lot of newer JUNK.  I have been completely unsuccessful when it comes to selling, so I don't even try anymore because I get insulted when I am offered $6 for a $200 item, and do not understand their reasoning for why they don't think most of my things will sell--yet, there is an amazing amount of REALLY UGLY STUFF on the racks.  I think the salespeople and ""buyers"" are very ignorant about fashion.  All one has to do is look at how they dress...like bag people. 

3/30/13

TELL YOUR CONDESCENDING MANAGER TO WASH HIS HAIR AND TAKE A SHOWER.  Just because you are promoting the alternative lifestyle, doesn't mean customers won't be offended by filthy, uncombed hair and such a slovenly presentation. GROSS!!! 

FINALLY GIVING UP ON THIS JOKE OF A PLACE :P"
1,"This place is an absolute NIGHTMARE. Also, disregard any reviews from prior to June/July of 2012 as this complex was under different management back then. 

I lived here for 3 years under BRE and almost always loved living here. Ever since renewing with the new management, MEB, last year I've been miserable. 

I was looking to upgrade from a 1BR to a 2BR and was instantly offered a great location in the complex with promise it was fully upgraded at a specific price (by Tomas). Two days later I got a call from the front office telling me I actually could not have that apartment as they had also offered it to someone else... and they would be giving it to the other people, not me - without explanation to why. They, however promised to find me another location. 

When the new location was determined I got a call but was told I wouldn't be able to see it until 10 days prior to my move in as it was currently occupied. The manager, Pam, promised that the unit was FULLY upgraded with a fireplace and new cabinets and laminate floors.  I was nervous to wait until so close to my move date but I  still trusted the new management group as they seemed eager to keep me in the complex. HUGE mistake. 

On my tour through the unit it was a disaster. The floors were stained. There was a terrible infestation of ants. The cabinets were so old and disgusting and the entire kitchen was so filthy it actually smelled. Even Carolyn (who was showing me the unit) seemed disgusted. 

At this point my current apartment was completely packed and ready to go only to now be told there were no acceptable, livable apartments in the complex for me to move in to. I was in a tight spot - I had very little time to look for another place to live and had to be traveling for work for the next 3 weeks. I felt stuck and dependent on the management to find me another location in the complex. 

I finally received a call from Pam that another location would be available for me to view and make a decision. When I came to view it Pam pawned me off on Carolyn to show me the unit (it was more important for her to go to lunch than to diffuse an already messy situation). Carolyn pleasantly obliged. The unit, to my surprise, was much cleaner. The carpets needed to be replaced which she assured me would happen. The cabinets were not upgraded and were stained as were the counters and the rent was higher than originally discussed. We reached an agreement to bring the rent back down if I didn't make them upgrade the kitchen (as usual, I got the raw end of the deal). When I viewed the unit I pointed out the loud noise coming from the apartment above me and mentioned that I would not be able to put up with that even during the day as I often work from a home office. I was told they would notify the neighbors someone would be moving in below so they were more conscientious of their noise.

After moving in I filled out the extensive ""pre-existing problems"" sheet with items that included overly patched walls, obvious flood damage on the ceiling as well as near the sink, scratch marks in the laundry room (even though I was assured this unit was previously pet free as I am VERY allergic to animals - again I let it go as the carpets were replaced and I just did a deep clean when I moved in), stained counter, stained cabinets, stained refrigerator, stained showers, rusty washed and dirty/damaged dryer. When I turned it in they made no offer to come correct any problems (something the previous management did when I first moved in to my first unit). 

The upstairs neighbors were never quieter than the day I saw the unit and were often MUCH louder. They played loud music, they dropped cigarette butts off their balcony onto mine, they threw garbage and food over their balcony. Every time I complained I was promised action that never seemed to come. At one point, after calling security on their loud noise after 2am I heard the security guard tell them it was ""the neighbor downstairs complaining"". This began the retaliation - my assigned parking spot is located far from my unit and every time I was walking back to my door they would sit on their balcony calling me vulgar things and spitting and pouring drinks over the balcony as I walked by. I reported this to no reaction from management as well. 

 I later found out the unit above was housing 5 people although only 1 was on the lease - meaning no other adult had been background checked  for a criminal history. As a woman living alone I became more concerned. I pushed harder for them to take action and in turn manager Pam offered to ""let"" me break my lease at no charge - she tried to push me out instead of dealing with the real issue. I pointed out that is MEB wanted to break the lease they would be legally obligated to abide by their terms just the same and that they wouldn't be doing ME the favor by trying to force me to leave and pay to try and move again. She relented and 5 months later the neighbors above me finally moved"
1,"Had to just walk out of here. They had a big party in the back room, and couldn't be bothered to help anyone else. 

We sat for 10 minutes before the server came to take our order. She didn't say hi, didn't say there would be a delay. 

Waited 20 more before asking how much longer. She didn't know. The only cook wasn't talking to her. We got up and left. This was Saturday at dinner time. Lame!"
5,"Had never been to this theater, but saw ""White Christmas"" last night.  Wow, wow, wow!  I was worried because sometimes regional theater companies aren't up to national standards.  But not here. Every member of the cast was outstanding.  There were some big production numbers and every detail was perfectly arranged and presented.  I wish I had a photo of that final scene were everyone is dressed in their red and white or green Christmas costumes in front of a large tree and lighted wreaths, with snow falling in the background. Gorgeous.

As for the theater, it was surprisingly small, which turned out to be a real treat as the proximity to the actors made the production more enjoyable rather than viewing it from a distant balcony or 60 rows away.  There is a very nice bar, and there was live music prior to the show.  At intermission, cookies, chocolate squares, and brownies were $2 -- about the price range as other theaters in the area.

Parking did not seem to be a problem, but finding the lot and theater was not clear at first.  When you turn into the entryway, there is a small sign showing that the theater is further back and you have to zig.  Once there, the parking lot was big (flat, no garage)."
5,Absolutely wonderful. IDK what the other guy was talking about complaining about the service. I was greeted with a smile and a friendly conversation while I waited for the old man to make my sandwiches. Reminds me of when I lived on the east coast. Got to love Boar's head.
5,"The staff here make the experience. Since I am not a fan of buffets, I can only tell you about the meals here. DELICIOUS. I don't eat meat, my boyfriend almost only eats meat, we both found things we loved. it was the best! We liked to eat here once a week since it was so amazing."
5,"Friendly quick service, veggie options, accommodating to any requests, great food, reasonable prices. My new fav place downtown."
1,"This Safeway scares me. Most of the checkers are scary, the shelves are constantly out of stock and the crazy bums that hang around the corner are annoying.

Whatever renovation they did failed (although I did win an iPod). I go to this place only when absolutely necessary. The Safeway on Osborn nearly 3 miles away is a helluva lot better choice.

WiFi? In a Safeway? This place manages to attract the creepiest people that sit on their laptops. They aren't sipping coffee, and I really don't want to know how they even afforded that Dell they are hunting and pecking away at."
5,"Somehow amid 18 credits both semesters of my senior year, I also managed to find time to do a whole lotta scrapbooking.  And this place pretty much carries everything and anything you need.  Printed papers, solid papers, pens and markers and pencils, stickers, die-cuts, acid-free adhesives, scissors, punches, and a great selection of albums.  I think they have classes, too, but being the *expert* scrapbooker I am (brushes hair off shoulder), I never checked those out though I'm sure they're a lot of fun.  Their workroom is well-stocked, and (*nerd alert!*) it is really fun & satisfying to lock yourself in a space like that with all the necessary tools and make an entire scrapbook in an evening or afternoon.

Middleton is really close to Madison/the UW Campus and convenient to get to.  The store is spacious and well laid-out; really, a photo-fanatic's dream!"
5,"Just by way of an update, another driver took me to Goodyear after I had work done on my car this week.  Again, my ride arrived very quickly, this time it was a regular ""on demand"" call.  The phone answerer said I may be waiting 5-10 minutes, and my cab arrived in just less than five!  Very friendly driver named Pete, and another clean cab.  Thanks!"
1,"I've lived here since '04.  It was managed by a different company, and it was a really nice place.  Quiet, working class residents, and families.  When the current mgt company took over, it started to slowly take a turn for the worse.  First thing they did was try to hassle me about my recent lease renewal before the prior company left.  Said I was paying to little.  Sorry, I signed the contract, you have to honor it......I agree with the other reviewers that stated how bad the customer relation skills of the employees in the leasing office are. (With the exception of CJ, he is very pleasant, and easy to talk to.  Unfortunately, he has no managerial power).  Less than a year ago I was on a 4month medical leave due to a kidney transplant.  My benefits were taking long to go through, so I advised the office of my situation, and wanted to work something out.  Sorry, no dice.  Since it took an extra 2 weeks to receive my funds (now I was over 10days late) they filed papers with a lawyer, and I got served.  So the money I just got, had to go to late fees, plus the lawyer fees, which were over $200 alone.  I wasn't allowed to set up a payment plan, pay half, or any other option.  Nice way to treat a long term tenant.  

They used to be so strict with issues such as picking up after your dog, parking your car properly within the lines. and noise problems.  Sadly all these things have gone.  It's almost like dodging land mines everyday.  Many of us have complained, but their HONEST to GOODNESS answer was, ""Well if we don't know who it is, we can't do anything about it.  Maybe if you took a picture of them, or told us the apt #"".......So I should hide in the bushes with a camera, or stalk the person?  I asked if they could at least put out a letter asking residents to be more mindful and respectful.  They said no.
Now I see abandoned cars with flat tires, broken headlights, and expired plates.  They used to have the vehicles towed just for having an expired plate.  The grills have been broken (handles, burners, self igniter, etc) for well over 4 years.

Sadly, the complex has mirrored the surrounding neighborhood a great deal the past few years.  Even a lot of the residents are just rude and discourteous.  They'll park in your spot or take up both theirs and yours.  Other neighbors have complained of their cars and apartments being broken into. And yet we still have no type of security presence. 

If you're a new tenant, they are all smiles and welcome you in.  But as a current resident, their expression conveys more of a ""What do you want?"" attitude.  You try to ask a question, or ask for help with maybe dealing with problems in the common areas (like broken bbq grills), and you get a 'Yeah we know', or a 'We'll look into it'.  Nothing ever happens.  They DON'T take care about the current and long term residents.  And because of all these issues, many of the good people have left.  

This for sure is my last lease.  It can't come fast enough.  If I'm able to save up enough money, I just may break it, so I can get out."
1,"Place is garbage, over priced, with lousy service.  Went there last nigh had a party of 5, Cyndi thought she needed to add 20% gratuity to our bill so she didn't have to really work for a tip. Just an awful place."
5,"Beyond great hotel! 

I was very happy with my five day stay at Hoilday Inn Hotel and Suites. Guest services were very helpful, friendly, and nice everyday with every person. They helped me out when having payment issues due to a third party setting up my stay for me. My room was nice, with a microwave and fridge, which I do not see often. This was prefect for a yelper on the hunt for great food; meaning I could bring things back with me. My bed was comfortable and room service cleaned everyday, placing things just where I left them if they need to making the bed or cleaning the sink. I was able to control the heat in the room! Big screen tv with hbo. Coffee maker in the room, iron in the room and FREE WIFI were a plus!

I also loved the workout room. While small, they had a few machines that could keep this girl happy. This room was next door to me and I barely heard the machines being used on the other side of the wall! Thanks for thinking of me! The wokout room was also clean. Breakfast was great and full of hot/cold selections. Not only pastries, but egged, bacon, cinnamon rolls, cereal, oatmeal, biscuits, ect. Things changed from day to day, but this was what a continental breakfast SHOULD be! 

Location wise, this hotel was only 7 min walk to the convention center. It is not far from the airport. I would save money by riding on the metro rail and walking down if you have carry-on, as the $24 dollar shuttle was not worth the distance to/ from the airport, but that's just me being cheap. 

I really loved my stay here and would recommend this place to anyone!"
1,Terrible service.
5,"This place is da bomb!  This is my go to place whenever I'm in Phoenix.  Great food, great prices, great staff.  And the portions are huge so you'll never leave here hungry.  I've had the ribs, beans, sweet potato fries, and sweet potato pie and they are all great.  Now they just need to open a location in Los Angeles..."
1,"Dr. Enrique Cruz is the most unprofessional person I have ever encountered. I rescued a nine-year old, 7lb dog from the Humane Society. Minnie was diagnosed with a Stage 3 heart murmur and the vet said she did not require medication. 30 days later, Dr. Cruz examined her and told me that her heart murmur was at 5.5-6 and required an Ace Inhibitor--$24 from his office. I called my local pharmacy and learned that I could buy it there for $4. I requested that he give me automatic renewals on the script--it is only 2.5 mg--because I have recently lost my job and health insurance and do not have the extra money for unneeded pet exams. When I got to the pharmacy, the script did not include renewals. I called the office and Stacey, the receptionist, said ""don't worry about it, we will renew it at the end of the month."" So, when I called back to get the renewal, Stacey told me that Dr. Cruz wanted Minnie to have lab work for $98 (he originally told me $198) before he renewed the script. I asked for what? She said, she didn't know. I re-explained that I am still unemployed and that when I find a job, I will bring her back in for an exam. Dr. Cruz got on the phone and immediately told me that he would not renew this script. As a health care professional for nearly 20 years, I asked him, ""why do you need this blood work when this script is prevention....it will not cure a heart murmur?"" He became angry and said that he did not want any liability. He further told me that my ""unemployment status was not his problem."" He said ""I won't renew her meds unless you get the blood work. Sorry, I can't help you..."".Then, he yelled, ""get a job!!!!!"" Then, he hung up! I called back and he answered and continued to scream at me.  I asked again, what is the blood work for? He again refused to answer me and hung up once more. I am reporting his behavior to the Arizona Medical Examining Board. I have talked to two pharmacists and a doctor and all three told me that the script should have come with renewals for at least 90 days. I have been taking an ace for seven years and have a annual check up....my doctor gives me a six month supply. He is an ASS! He will only be friendly to you, if you can line his pocket."
5,Another fun and delicious meal with the nieces.  Great iced tea as well.
5,"Really great value! Best fast food burgers in town, better than culvers. Went on a Thursday and thick burger combo was $6 bucks with tax! Burger was big tasty and messy. Fries we're hot and seasoned nicely.  If your thinking red robin burger without the sit down price tag, come here and you'll be pleasantly surprised :)"
1,"Service was incredibly slow. It seemed like they had maybe 3 people working, and we'd often wait (what felt like) 15 minutes to get any attention, even when I was just standing there waiting to be seated (or greeted, for that matter).

The menu is fairly comprehensive. The food is decent. I wasn't amazingly impressed, but I wasn't disappointed, either. Some of the prices seem steep. The atmosphere is kind of cramped and congested, but it was comfortable. Slightly loud, but you could still hear each other talk.

But considering that I lost my dinner after I got home, I'm okay with not going back. No huge loss here."
5,"Adam M. was absolutely right: The Chinese Broccoli in Garlic Sauce and the Mixed Seafood Hot Pot (Casserole) are really, really amazing! I've also become a big fan of the Tomato Sauce Shrimp - tastes nothing like what you're thinking. 

Eat these items we recommend or be seriously disappointed trying the chinese staples you've become brainwashed into enjoying elsewhere."
1,"Wow...I can't believe the rave reviews this joint gets!!! I am FAR from impressed...Hot giardenara? Is that what they called those pickled jalapenos they put on their sandwich?! NO WAY If you want authentic Italian Beef catch a flight to ORD and go to Portillo's or Gene and Jude's...
This place is sub-par at best! If you're looking for something remotely close to Chicago Italian Beef in Arizona, go to Tom's BBQ or Lobby's on Southern and McClintock...This place doesn't live up to the hype!  Don't waste your time! People who love it must not be from Chicago..."
1,"So, it's not like this place was ever gonna make it outta my e-gutter, cuz there's nothing really redeeming about it. You know, sometimes a craving makes one act desperately... sometimes against one's better knowledge. Nevertheless, I make my way to Monty's one fine day, craving some sort of ice-cream based treat, similar to a beverage, but of a thicker consistency. Nothing special, just some plain old ice cream and say, caramel. It was $6.38?! Okay, so I go into a Vincent Vega state of mind, zoning out while the shake's bein' made thinking to myself ""Did I just order a six-dollars n' 38 cent shake? Sure did. A shake? Milk, ice cream, caramel? Uh-huh. Six-dollars n' 38 cents? Yep. They don't put bourbon in it or anything? Nope. Just checking... smh... Whoa, WHAT?! When it came up, it was in a small, flimsy styro cup, with a sad lil' wafer sticking out the top. Wait... did they just charge me like that much for this??? Ugh! I was so pissed, I told em' keep it, n' got my money back. I can get Culver's or Michael's for like, way better... Even the Chocolate Shoppe, or like, buy your own pint and a gallon of milk, stir in some Smucker's flavoring and have change to spare... I don't even know why people like this place. Dude, seriously..."
5,"The food is awesome, the atmosphere is super and the wait staff is pretty friendly. I had the big unit hot dog and it was quite tasty but I could not finish it. The food was quite good as was the place itself with the decor was pretty cool. The music was rock as expected and basically this is a better version of Hard Rock Cafe."
5,"I really trust the guys at Monona Motors. I feel that their prices are fair, and they will explain things in lay-man's terms. I feel fortunate to have an honest, quality garage like this in my neighborhood."
5,"Great car wash place! Got me in quickly on a busy, Friday afternoon. Good prices and you can get a $2 coupon on yelp. Drive through car wash, vacuum and the works if you want it!"
5,"Went here for Comic-Con.  Wow, lots of people.  We had a great time though and the Phoenix Convention Center was a great location.

The security was a little lax though.  That was scary.  We got into the building every day without going through security b'c we went up the elevator from the garage.  The first time we had no idea and it took us a while to figure out where registration was.  Total glitch in their security surveillance though for us to be able to get in like that!

Nonetheless, we had a great time.  It was nice and cool in the building which is always a plus in Phoenix!"
5,The best meat market in Madison. It has great gresh chicken brests. Get the burgundy marinaded steak. Check it out.
5,"This place is great! Definitely deserves more than the 3.5 stars it has on here!

The chips and salsa are the best I've ever had. I got steak fajitas that were excellent. My friend really enjoyed her meal as well (can't quite remember what it was). Very fair prices, almost cheap for how good it is and the ambiance is quite nice. Definitely worth a visit, I'll probably eat here every time I visit Phoenix!"
5,"I heard funny noises and my car wasn't shifting right... it made me a bit leery, and I am from out of town.  

I called East Side, and they were very up front saying that they would be able to drive it around, check my fluid levels, and let me know what they thought.

Everywhere else I had contacted was booked, and these guys came through!

Very Helpful!"
5,"I love this place! The chicken and dumplings I had today were delicious and the service was amazing and super friendly as usual! For a comfortable dining experience, visit 3 sisters! :-)"
1,"Disappointing. I've been to lots of taquerias in Mexico, St. Louis and California, and this one was way below average. As much as I like authentic Mexican food, I'd prefer a big chain over this place. Not recommended."
5,Great entertainment...Amanda went the extra mile for our thirst!!
5,"I love breakfast, and at Cottage Cafe, they really get it right.  The food is the biggest hit with lots of basic American breakfast fare options.  Expect to leave stuffed as the portion sizes are pretty big.  The coffee service is awesome and the whole staff is quite friendly and efficient.  You get all of this at a super reasonable price."
1,Have been to this place twice and the experience was the same. I personally don't get what draws people to this place. It's got a bit of a negative vibe. The staff is not friendly or service oriented and it's dirty. Great location for a light rail pub crawl - I think it just might not be our crowd.
5,"Attended dress rehearsal for Maestro John Williams leading the Phoenix Symphony in advance of the concert tonight with Steven Spielberg.  It was 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning for the rehearsal and the PS staff and ushers were dressed up, courteous and professional.  Plus, on the way existing the concert hall, two ushers thanked me for attending ""the rehearsal.""  Great service all the way around.  Wish I was attending the concert tonight.  Awesome experience and always love attending the Phoenix Symphony.  Thanks too, to Maestro Williams."
1,"I am only giving -THIS- location a 1 star because of their horrible early hours!! They close like at 7 pm during the week, & they already closed at 3 pm on Sunday! ...I was pissed! The new Chipotle a block away at City scape is open til 10 pm daily! ...So there! What is it with everything closing sooo damn early in Phoenix! This is such an early city! Some eating places even close at 2:30 pm, like The Good Egg & First Watch... They wouldn't DARE close that early in LA because they would lose a lot of profit!  (...I am from LA)."
1,"I have lived here for almost 2 years. It's been one ridiculous thing after the other. They forgot to charge is for our pets- we called to remind them we had pets- twice!! No-one ever returned our calls. Months later they back billed us for- guess what?! You got it!! Our pets!! 

When our lease was up the first time (should've taken the opportunity to run for it!) they harassed us daily about re-signing a lease. The lease renewal letter they gave us had the incorrect date on it that our lease was up. I called to talk to them about it- no call back (I called 4 times! Christian the office manager is a half wit!) I finally went in to talk to someone in person. Their response?! The administrative error of the wrong lease end date was my issue, they are not responsible. We were trying to decide if we could move and to where and ran out of time to decide due to the office error and signed a new lease (for 6 months) as a last resort. 

Our hot water heater sprung a leak at 3 am. Our neighbor called it in (leaking through to their apt); maintenance shows up, has to replace the hot water heater and left the old one on our stoop by the front door for days. I called the office 3 times to see when it would be removed- without any resolution. I came home from dinner later in the week to find the hot water heater gone and a letter from a lawyer stating that I had been ""served"" with an eviction notice for having trash on my stoop!!!!!! First off- you have to ""serve"" someone legal documents in person, not shove them in the door AND the papers weren't even signed by anyone!!!! I was FURIOUS! I forwent the option to call and went into the office- pissed! Christian was on vacation and he was the only one I could speak to in regards to my issues. I asked for his return date and called him everyday for a week after with no call back. No one ever called me back- Obviously! and I am still living here, so needless to say the letter was complete bullsh**!

I am so sick of this place! The view of Papago and the golf course is gorgeous but I will be getting the hell out of here as soon as this lease is up! Do NOT do it to yourself!! Horrible horrible property management!!!"
5,"Doctor Brandon is fantastic. his equipment is first class, and he will help you with anything. He also won't sell you things you don't need. He is the one Doctor I have that I feel like actually listens to me and my family, and helps us with all the health problems we have to find solutions. Focusing, Allergies, diet help for eyes etc. They always offer snacks and drink when we are there and see us fast and get us in fast. They are not inexpensive, but their glasses are quality. They don't sell any plastic lenses. So you are not going to find cheap glasses here. That being said my glasses have been dropped and stepped on and never break."
5,"This place is great! Lots of great stuff, and priced to move. And I mean really, REALLY priced to move. My husband could have spent days in there looking around (his words), and it's great to have a place like this in the community where you can not only drop off leftover supplies and hardware (or countertops, cabinets, doors, windows, sinks, you name it!) that's still useable so that it doesn't go to the landfill, and also for picking up odds and ends for a building or remodeling project. I have a very strong inclination to say that we'll be back!"
1,closed.
5,"I like this place.I don't get to peruse often enough,but it's always a refreshing adventure when I do have the opportunity.
They've got a decent amount of Crowley and the likes that many others won't even carry because it's not the pretty sparkly faerie dusty stuff.
The folks who run the place are always warm,genuine and inviting.
I even had a spooky kinda thing happen here.
It was 2 years ago in December.I stopped in between job interviews to find some candles for a friend.
They didn't have what I was looking for,but on my way out,a lady sitting at a reading table said,""before you go,come pick out a stone""from a bowl of shiny lil rocks.
I picked one I liked and she told me it would bring me something I needed.
I laughed to myself and said,""well,that would be a job""...(I'd been looking for a franticly stressed 2 months)and about 2 hours after I left the store,I got not one but 2 different offers.
I did call the store the next day to let her know what happened.
I don't neccessarilly believe in that sort of thing,but thought the experience was creepy cool none the less."
1,"WORST FOOD EVER!! 

I went there for their lunch specials and got the sweet and sour chicken. 

The egg roll was great, but the sweet and sour chicken was horrible. The sauce had no flavor and ruined my entire dish. Depending on your liking, the there were very thick peices of chicken within the dish with very little breading. I personal enjoy breading with my sweet and sour chicken."
5,"I always find myself here before flights out of Sky Harbor. Just like walking into a mercado! Yummy stuff. Haven't tried everything on the menu, but can't see where they'd go wrong."
1,"saw a fly dancing on my sandwich when waiting for my order, they don't bother to pay attention anyway since there are quite a lot customers , awful awful place even though i have very good experience with other panera bread"
5,"Everything about this place rules the bakery, my fav is the pan dulce and they have never ending varieties of everything, the kitchen part is great food to order great prices, the refresco cold drink bar with fresh fruit yummm. It is a huge place and has lot's of elbow room. If you are into meat you will love their meat dept. it is muy gigante! FUN FUN place for everyone for sure!!"
1,"Not a fan. I desperately needed a manicure and being new to the area, stumbled upon this nail salon. I had heard about Nini Nails (on the west side) but didn't want to stray too far away from home just to get my nails done. BIG MISTAKE. I waited FOREVER for someone to assist me (even though it was mid-week and not busy) and to make matters worse, my nails chipped within 3 days."
5,"Ryan's is AWESOME! They have really cool products at even better prices! Next time you're at another pet store and you see something that you like there, make sure you check out Ryan's Pet Supplies first. They will most likely have it at an even cheaper price. They even carry their own brand name shampoo and  grooming supplies which is also nice. Everyone there is super friendly and very knowledgeable. Jodie is always so cheerful and quick to check me out when I'm in a hurry. Monica is always a pleasure to work with for she always keeps me up to date with all of my order status' and the payment options that are available to me. I can also always count on Phyllis to give me helpful grooming tips as well. Check 'em out for yourself and see!"
1,"Pane Bianco:  Stuck in a Rut.

I've had all the sandwiches about 50 times each.
Dump the Sopprasata please - time for a change.

Bring back more of the Meatballs / Sausage and other bitchin Markets."
1,"I went there a few months ago for Fish Fry after reading a rating that this place was a great place for Fish Fry's. I've had dinner here before and it was very good, so I thought oh why not, I'll give it a try. Big mistake! They usually get pretty busy (usually a good sign), but that night we didn't have to wait long for a table. I ordered the Icelandic Cod and It was terrible. As this was a few months ago, my brain is clouded on which exact fish (cod or perch) the comments were made about, but as I recall: The waitress claimed that the cod isn't ""fresh"" and she knew I didn't like it, so she offered to get me some perch, which was fresh. That wasn't much better. One (either the cod or the perch) of them tasted, looked like and smelled like a ""fish stick."" It literally looked like a kiddie meal. All in all, I will never return for a fish fry there. The waitress was very attentive and tried to make me happy, but it was not her fault, she did everything she could to please me. Service = 5 star, Atmosphere = 4 Star, Food (overall) = 4 Star, Fish Fry = 1 Star"
1,"I went shopping at Staples today for my store business supplies. I was appalled by the service I received from the associates in the front including the manager, Katie. 

I had made purchases and awaited assistance from the ""manager"" in regards to a defected item. While I waited an associate approached me. I told her I was awaiting a managers assistance. I then told her the item I wanted to purchase was defected. Instead of checking another store for the item. She told me 10% off. Then I told her I would wait for the manager. She SLAMMED the item on the counter and said the manager will tell me the same. At this point I could not believe the hostility towards a customer. I waited for the manager, Katie. I told Katie about my experience with the associate. Katie then told me okay, without apologizing for the experience I just encountered. I then proceeded to locate a corporate number. Katie then approached me with the stores number. I cannot tolerate this service. 

The employees here definitely do not want to be there. They should have the proper training. 

I could not believe that the manager's actions were just like the associate. Extremely rude. 

I refuse to shop at this Staples for my business supplies. I may get better service at a competitors store. I really just want upper management to know the things that are occurring in this location. 

Katie the ""manager"" - Very unprofessional, unpolished, appeared that she hasn't showered in a few days."

5,"back in my younger days of bakery, I worked at the bakery that supplied NOTO with french bread.   It had to be a certain length, a certain crust, and a certain color if it wasn't......................YIKES!!

I figured if he had such a high standard of quality for his bread, that the same mind of detail would apply to his food, and I was right., I used to eat at his restuarant faithfully every week.....then i moved :(

I was in town so I stopped in on friday for some lunch.  The food was excellent.   I ordered the fried fish with sauce pecan meuniere and the fried cod po' boy.   The bread was ok (I stand by the bread we used to make years ago....it was just perfect), the fish was fried to perfection and the lettuce, tomato, and pickle were just right.    as for the fried fish with the pecan sauce,   I got a half order.  wasn't enough.  I had forgotten just how great the sauce with the rice and the fish really were.    

Go here for some great food."
1,please tear this place down.
1,"I can't actually rate the food because we left before it got that far. 

Drinks and service were horriable - not to mention the fact that it was like 100 degrees in there. Ohh and they  seem to have worked very hard in the design to  fit the absolute max amount of people per square foot with zero regard for comfort. There are tables jammed into every possible space."
1,"When my wife told me about some of her students in a music competition that was being held here - I was excited. I have never been, and besides it has to be cool right?


Wrong.

These kids played their heart out - tremendous talent. It was great, honestly refreshing - most of the bands were better than anything they play on the radio.

The venue - you know a place created by a musician? A place that has rock & roll memorabilia all over the walls - a restaurant supposed to celebrate music?

Complete and total let down. Alice Cooper, you should be ashamed.

The venue didn't even bother to take the time to set up tables and chairs for the parents, teachers, and sponsor supporting them.

There was basically zero wait staff.

At least half the tables in the outdoor area (where the stage was set-up) were high-tops - which would have been fine - if there were chairs to go with them.

Instead everyone was sitting in those El' Cheapo $5 green plastic lawn chairs. This not only was uncomfortable, but it negated the entire usefulness of the high top tables. 

At least 4 times during the 2 hours I head the phrase ""Please tip well"" and ""Please make sure you tip the wait staff well.""

There was NO wait service - at all. You had to walk up to the counter and order. They had one poor employee trying to pick up all the empty cups/trash from a decent sized group of people.

I would rather give my ""tip"" money to the kids to buy more drum sticks guitar strings than give to a place that could care less about providing a comfortable place to watch talented kids play great music. Why would I tip people who did nothing to provide their services (you know...food?)

They had the top balcony section closed - I do not know why - our group would have loved to sit up there and hear the kids. But I guess when you have a whopping two or three tables to wait on inside (not related to the event, the place was a ghost town except for the people there to see the kids) it would be too much trouble to go up some stairs.

If they actually cared - and had staff there to support the event (3-4 waiters/waitresses would have been sufficient) they could have made some really good money off food sales.


I certainly hope that in the future they secure somewhere that cares enough to at least properly set up the area for people to attend/sit. Heaven forbid the place actually function like a restaurant should and try to serve food/beverage.

It is a shame the rest of the competition is being held there. The kids deserve so much better."
5,"The best frozen custard!

It's very smooth and creamy though a bit sweet. Every time I go to Madison, I need to stop here for some creamy frozen treat. The chocolate pecan is my favorite."
5,"Dr. Stevens is a fantastic surgeon.  He has performed over 400 spinal surgeries and came highly recommended by volunteers and staff at Scottsdale Healthcare - Dr. Stevens corrected my 62 degree scoliosis curve.  The surgery was further complicated by the fact that I had severe osteoporosis in my lumbar spine.  If Dr. Stevens was not as experienced and knowledgeable as he is, my surgery would not have succeeded.  Don't let his confident manner scare you away.  He is the best!"
1,"Stay away. Far away.

I had been hearing about Fate for a while. I had high expectations, since I had been to Lucky Dragon in the past (the owners prev joint) which was OK.

It was the worst Chinese/Asian I've had in AZ, the service was terrible, the chairs uncomfortable, and to top it off my fiancee got food poisoning.... and has been sick for the last 2 days from it. I took her to the ER this morning at 4:30 AM and decided to finally start posting on Yelp since I've been a lurker for a while.

Aesthetics:
Initially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city. Nice patio, cool inside.  However... The seating at a bus stop is more comfy. There is no chair back - just this high bar thing that digs into your back.

I'm going to file this under aesthetics - we ordered the Hot and Sour soup (more on that later) and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share. However, they apparently don't have any kind of serving utensil, so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine. WTF?

Service:
I don't know a nicer way to say it, our waitress was a dopey bimbo. It took 20 minutes for her to take our order. She went missing for long periods of time when I had an empty water glass, and then for a while longer after I tracked her down and asked for some. Not good.

Food:
I ran into a friend there, and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didn't like it. To be blunt, it was utter crap. 

The hot and sour soup was thin and spicy. That's it. It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present. It's not like any hot and sour soup I ever had.... in a bad way. There are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg. 

I ordered some Saigon basil something or other dish with beef, she ordered the Lemon Grass whatever with tofu.
My dish was bad. The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy, and totally lacked flavor. As for basil, there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish, and that's it. The sauce was thin and one dimensional. 

Her lemon grass dish was also bad. The sauce tasted like Tom Yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water. I felt bad for the poor abused tofu.

I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.... but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste. Screw that, even the chinese place in the mall food court is better. I am not exaggerating. It was a very disappointing meal.

Now for the nasty part.
I drank water - Fiancee unit drank th 'Green Tea.' It was like no other green tea I ever had seen. It was leprechaun green, with some kind of milk like substance in it.I thought it looked kinda funky, but she drank it.

It was the only difference between our meals. I tried hers, she tried mine, etc. I didn't drink the science experiment tea.

Well... Several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains. She spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea.  2 days later the vomiting has subsided but she's missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm. I took her to the ER at 4:30 AM this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning. Admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got (and recovered from) a tropical disease so her immune system is not at it's strongest right now, but come on. This shouldn't be the end result. Plus this IS downtown Phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems, if you know what I mean, due to lifestyle choices.

There is some great Asian food in Central Phoenix. 

Maxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th ave.
The Cultural Center has a few great places, esp Golden Buddha. 
Thai Lahna has been consistently good for years.
Like I said I don't eat a lot of chain food - but even the Pei Wei at 7th ave and McDowell is way better in terms of food quality."
5,"My wife's Mini Cooper had to have its engine replaced. She no longer felt comfortable driving that car. We visited Nissan, Honda, Toyota and VW dealerships and ultimately had the best experience with Zimbrick VW in Middleton. Otto was very helpful. He was not pushy and gave us all the information we needed to make a decision.

Zimbrick made a very fair offer to trade in the Mini but we ended up selling it ourselves. Once my wife's car was sold, Otto made the process very quick and easy so we had her in her new Passat the same day. He even stayed after closing to walk her through setting up her new car!

When I replace my Toyota RAV4, I will definitely consider Zimbrick VW."
5,"5 stars for food and service. The atmosphere and decor could use some help -- the interior is clean and neat, but dated. The outside/exterior can't be helping business -- if you can get past the stark white exterior walls, the green roof line, and the nondescript sign, you'll be treated to a good, ""from scratch"" meal that tastes homemade, with excellent/friendly service. This is a great place for breakfast."
5,"Went again and it was AMAZING as usual. Went with a group of coworkers and we started out with escargot, crab puffs and stuffed mushrooms...YUM

For the entree's I had some pork masterpiece that was a featured dish and it was divine. For dessert I believe I had the dark chocolate creme brulee again. It was another great experience!"
5,This place is the bomb.   Fresh burgers and the cheese curds are melt in your mouth perfect.   The service is way above average and the restaurant is very clean.   I have enjoyed Culvers for years when we would visit on vacation.   Now we live here and we make a weekly visit to Culvers for dinner.   Of course you have to top the meal off with a custard.   It is a fast food restaurant but it is way above what you would expect from a fast food restaurant.
1,Was not impressed with my too oily & tasteless shrimp meal. I walked out wishing I went to Chili's.
5,"Delicious!

B introduced me to this place because he eats here at least twice a week, and my god, I now understand why. They have the most delicious wraps I have ever tasted in my entire life!

Fresh delicious ingredients that are actually healthy for you.. and I love nothing more than healthy food that doesn't taste healthy at all.. for instance, the teriyaki 90210.. Grilled teriyaki chicken, crunchy veggies, fresh ginger slaw & jasmine rice.. amazing! Rocky VII, who doesn't love cheese-steak?? Not the healthiest choice they have to offer, but goddamn delicious. Ive also tried the Gringo Star which is the mexicany wrap and The Godfather with salami, ham and my favorite, provolone. I usually get the pasta salad to accompany my lunch, which is also, very yummy. Ive literally never tried anything here my mouth didn't instantly fall in love with. 

Really, the only thing that sucks about this place is the parking lot.. its tiny! You're lucky if  you can even find a spot during the lunch rush, and if you do, you're lucky if you can get your vehicle out of there once you've parked. People create their own spots at this joint, sometimes behind your car.. but really, park across the street and walk if you have to, it is absolutely worth it!"
1,"Ordered a Bean and Cheese Burrito the other night in the drive-thru, didn't know I mistakingly ordered the Lard and Cheese Burrito. Three of the worst dollars I've ever spent.

As far as drive-thru Mexican places I've given a try in my day (and I've given a few too many a try), this might be the worst.

I've yet to find a really good dirty taco shop around downtown, but the Filberto's by Glam is a lot better."
1,"Very scary and shady vibe. As a woman, I will never come back here. A lot of standing around and staring at customers.  I felt extremely uncomfortable."
1,"Do not go here! 

This place simply nasty. I have been to any hot yoga classes and this studio is by far the worst. 

They have mold and such a stench that lingers through the entire place. Honestly, made me sick. It is so unkempt and dirty!

I would never suggest this place to anyone."
1,"I know that people really like this place and it is a very nice thing to have a local market in this neighborhood.   But I have to bring this place down a few notches. 
I had the displeasure of having to resolve some issues with the management some time ago and was met with such a smug and uncooperative attitude that it greatly changed my opinion of the place.
A good grocery requires happy management and for some reason these people are very unhappy."
1,"My bf was visting from Colorado Springs and we were in the mood for seafood, yeah in Phoenix, but we decided to try this place anyway. What were we thinking? There was nothing wrong with service, the food was terrible. It's definitely not what you expect when you look the price, really pricey. We shared oysters for the appetizer. I ordered a clam chowder. It was fine, not outstanding but edible. My bf ordered a ceasar salad, the plate was warm, the romaine was wilted. He is not a picky person but he did not hesitate to send it back. I ordered the scallops which were ok, a little on the rubbery side and it came with brown risotto. It was all too dry, I had to get an extra glass of water to wash it all down. It sat like a lump in my stomach, leaving no room for desert. My bf chose the mussels in an herb de provance soup. It was a bunch mussles that looked like they were swimming in yellow water. The taste? None, it was tasteless and watered down, no butter, no white wine, nothing to make it taste good. The herbs did nothing for the dish.
Would I go back to give it a second chance, nah, not for the price. The most unsatisfying place I have ever eaten."
5,"I try to not speak like a rapper, but ""haters gonna hate.""

Seriously, this place is a dive bar, not a high-end french restaurant.  The servers sometimes double as bartenders.  You do not go to this place for the fast service, that is what people made McDonald's for.  You go for the 1lb. burgers!  They range from $7-$8.  How do they make money?

Is it the best burger?  No.  Is it in the top 5 of burgers that I have eaten?  Yes.  Definitely.  Everything is well thought out right down the to the bun choice.  The burgers all come with kettle chips.  I hate kettle chips.  Hate them.  You know what?  I ate theirs.  So good.  

Yeah, the service took awhile, but you do not go to a dive bar to get out of there fast.  The server was friendly and precise (I did not want onions, I did not get onions).  That care barely be said about high end restaurants.  It was nice to sit back and relax and then the burger came.  They are huge.  I had a cheeseburger.  I barely made it through half.  They are cooked medium well, but they are still so juicy.  The vegetables are fresh and generous.  I had two pieces of tomato large enough that one covered the burger.  

My friend had the bacon cheeseburger.  I could barely see the burger under the bacon.  It was amazing.  I dared not try that on my first time out.  

I can not wait to try their hot ham and cheese.  It comes with two HUGE slices of ham.  They have brunch on Sundays.  I am talking myself down from finding any excuse to go there again."
5,"i've only been here a few times for take out, so i can't speak for the service.  my food was TERRIFIC-- especially the carne asada burros and guacamole-- and ready for me when i arrived.  the salsas (i loooooved the green) were good as well.  i've eaten a lot of mexican food in my day, and this was top notch."
1,"I decided to let some time pass before writing a review, but I find that even though several months have passed I am still disappointed.  I find that I am still very hurt by the way we were treated by Dr. Zacher's office.  My husband had gone in for his regularly scheduled cleaning.  The office wanted to take x-rays.  My husband was not having any dental issues or problems.  He was in for a regular cleaning.  He is in the medical profession and has done a lot of research about the overuse of dental x-rays.  He asked that he not have x-rays taken on this visit.   Dr. Zacher and his staff said that they could not clean his teeth without the x-rays so they couldn't help him any further and he left the office without the cleaning.  We never heard anything further on this matter.  A couple of months after this incident our daughter fell and injured her tooth.  When we were checking out, Rhonda said that since my husband had walked out on his visit that we would have to pay for his visit that day.  The total was well over $300.  I was standing at the desk, while Rhonda was saying rather loudly that since my husband walked out we had to pay.  It was very embarrassing since there was a family friend in line behind me.  I was so humiliated.  I didn't know what to say so I paid the bill.  I later inquired of several friends in the medical field about the industry standard for no show fees.  The typical fee for a no show visit is about $30.  They had never sent us a bill for the visit, but rather waited until I was in the office to embarrass me on the spot.  We are a family with seven children, one in college, and they saw no problem with being unfair and gouging us for the visit.  I have no problem with paying a REASONABLE fee for the visit.  My husband was not asked to pay a cancellation fee when he left, and we were never sent a bill in the mail.  They took great joy in embarrassing me in front of a family friend after coming in for an emergency visit. I am just so sad that after years of using Dr. Zacher, they would take advantage of our family like that."
1,"In the world of cakes, there's somehow an unspoken rule that if it's pretty, it's okay to be subpar in taste and moistness. In my world, this does not compute. It needs to be as tasty as it is pretty. Period.

So I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake, but nothing more. Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it... that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so. If you like the taste of fondant... you've got to be kidding me--Yucky!

So take my review or leave it. I just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second... less of course it's for a wedding, than it needs to be both EQUALLY. Who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake? Not me. So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to me.

Now, I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting. Frosting is secondary to me. So if you are more for frosting than for cake, ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine... no really, go ahead.

If there IS frosting--for me and others like me, a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting... then BRING IT ON! I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake, I won't make it a point to get an inside piece, or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cake.

Anyway, Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me. If I have to partake in one of her treats, I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake.

As for MJ Bread, I have no complaints there... their breads really impressed. I can't remember which CenPho restaurant I had my first taste of MJ bread, but I remember being V E R Y impressed."
1,"Not sure why this place has so many good reviews as the food is not Chinese! I'm a Chinese girl myself and I know how Chinese food should taste like. And this place does not have the authentic Chinese taste, in fact, it is a mixture of American, Thai and Chinese altogether which makes me disappointed. However, what makes me even more disappointed was when I ordered beef lo mein, The waiter was too busy chitchatting with guests and put in pork lo mein instead. When I called him back (it was a takeout order) he was saying it was his mistake and will credit that for my future order and refused to replace it! I was like, really? Definitely will not come back and  not recommend this place to friends and family!"
5,"Perfectly relaxing ambiance with artistic decor. Friendly staff. Tasty food (had the delicious Turkey BLT today). Wonderfully balance cup of cafe latte (soy and vanilla flavor available).

They also have a drive-thru option if you're in a hurry."
1,"Ordered two bowls of noodle with the wife.  An hour after walking in the door, we still didn't have noodles.  

The waitress walked by 6 or seven times and was avoiding making eye contact.  Finally we had to leave to pick up our kids, not having eaten, not having had any sort of good service.  The waitress couldn't fathom why we would leave after having already been there about an hour.

I have eaten here before and it has decent food but I won't be wasting anymore of my time here.  The complete lack of an attempt at service or even acknowledging the lack of it is inexcusable in a service industry with so many options.

Hana has better Sushi/Japanese and is very near by on 7th ave."
1,"I don't understand why people eat here. The food is greasy, the restaurant/ store/bakery smells, and you get that smell with you in your clothes. I went over a week ago with some coworkers as an ""appreciation "" meal, thanks but no thanks. I am from Mexico, and even the street restaurants are better than this."
5,"La Tolteca is Restaurant/Bakery/Market and sells the best authentic Mexican food I've ever had in the states.  The atmosphere is fast paced/to-go style and there isn't a thing on the menu that isn't to die for!  No need to get dressed up, just sit back, get messy, and enjoy!"
5,"This place is like crack for foodies :)  You just cannot get enough!  This should be #1 on your list when out of towners visit you, they'll just drop their collective jaws.  Hit Tradiciones for lunch or dinner and then the market for those tortillas steamin' in the bag OMFG there's little finer in life!!  Their homemade chorizo is spot on, produce is good (and CHEAP!) .  I want one in Moon Valley!"
1,When Rocky's is good it is very good.  However it is always a hit or miss. Today was the worst pizza I have ever had. The bread sticks were hard as croutons and my pizza was barely warmer than room temperature and looked as if it was made hours before. My husbands also was just as bad.
5,"I have driven 7 hours to eat here! i am Chinese and have lived in SF so I have had my fair share of Chinese food. This is the real deal. My wife and I stumbled upon this place 4 years ago. We have literally made trips to Phoenix from New Mexico for the food at GHK. Food is consistent, authentic and just damn good. Be careful, I am pretty sure the staff and chefs customizes your food. If you are non Asian and order sweet and sour pork and egg foo young, you will probably get Americanized Chinese food.  Our favorites are the lobster with ginger and scallions, satay fish pan fried noodles, walnut shrimp and beef chow fun. Ask the waitress for authentic Chinese.  And tell them the Fat Chinese guy from New Mexico sent you. :)"
1,"This complex is not interested in customer service. They do nothing to retain residents, just keep raising rent and lying to you. They say they are97% full but are not even close. They send renewal notices and when you go in to address renewal options, they do not even agree to what they gave you in their written notice.
Locks for pool gates have been broken for well over a year and never replaced. Maintenance issues are neglected or given a ""duct tape"" repair. This facility wants immediate money and will fine you for anything, charge you for everything when you move, and do nothing to retain you - except raise your rent and lie to you. 
Class C property with poorly trained staff and an ownership that is clueless on property management. 
HUD would love for all resident complaints to come to them, as management violates many Federal laws."
5,"Once, when I was a kid, I was reading a book at recess because I was a big nerd and that's how I rolled.  

This kid in my school, his name was Weston, came up behind me and, without warning, kicked me in the crotch as hard as he could.  It was the kind of kick where I didn't see it coming.  His foot caught me right in the jewel-box and lifted me a good six inches off the ground.  I felt everything go weak in my body.  I crumpled to the ground clutching my boys and screaming.  I cried like a little baby.  You would have, too.  

Weston ran off--I didn't find out he was the one who did it until days later.  When the playground teacher walked over to find out what was wrong with me, I couldn't even talk to tell her what had happened.  I thew up from the pain.  

When I could finally function again, I discovered my book had scattered a few feet out in front of me and landed in a puddle.  It was ruined.  And I had brought that book from home.

For weeks, nay MONTHS, after that, the other boys in my class thought it was so funny that I got nut-rocked like I did, that they spent most of their free moments trying to find ways to replicate it.  When I walked through the halls, I had to constantly look over my shoulder, lest I find a foot planted in my nards.  When I was at recess, I had to stand with my back to the wall at all times, lest someone attempt to crotch-punt me across the playground again.  

It was miserable.  I had started out first grade loving school.  After that day, I never once liked school again.

Sarku Japan's chicken teriyaki is so good, that when I eat it, for a few blessed seconds, I forget the trauma of that event."
5,Matt and Tim were great. When going over solutions I felt they were straight forward and upfront about the cost of the repairs. I  also felt that they understood how I felt about being separated from my money. Our Volvo is running great and we hope to keep it running for a long time with the help of Virginia Auto Service.
5,"I love Comedor Guadalajara.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner.  

I have rarely been disappointed, but  when I have been disappointed it was when I tied something different from what I normally order.   I typically order the same items over and over again (because I know what I like) and those selections are always fabulous.

The salsa is hot (some times it is really HOT) and the soup is soooo good.  

If you have not been and you like good Mexican food; you must try it."
5,"This place was awesome. The nail techs were very nice, it's clean, and reasonably priced. I paid $45 plus tip for a pedicure and shellac manicure. Definitely worth it!"
1,"Went here for lunch with two co-workers, checked Yelp before we went and the reviews were very positive so we decided to give it a try.

Yikes! How can the reviews be 4-5 stars and the service at best ""average"", the food was terrible and myself and my co-workers all agreed, this restaurant doesn't rate two stars.

I had one of the special Friday offerings, Smelt. It came with a salad (very average but fresh), fries (ordinary) and the Smelt. After a 20-25 minute wait our server came with our orders. I looked at my plate and was shocked! There was 12-15 so-called Smelt about 3"" long and deep fried. They looked like little fat cigarettes! I bit into one and it was all batter, I tried another and it was the same. I had deep fried batter for lunch!!
I haven't had a meal this bad since I got out of the Navy! 

 My co-workes meals were not much better, one had Chicken Fried Steak and he said it was made out of the box. My other co-worker had the Cod and he said it was mushy and brown colored! YUK! 

I hate to write such a negative review but this restaurant earned ""one"" star. Maybe they have great breakfast! I hope they do because their lunches are sub-par. 

There are other restaurants on this street/highway, I'd give them a try before I stopped here. I know my co-workers and I won't be coming back."
1,I set up an apointment on the website. they called me an hour later to tell me they had over booked without checking their online apointments.  Why even have an online apointment booking service if your store reps are too dumb to even check it?
1,"NEVER going back to this place.  We went for breakfast as a table of four.  It was packed, Sunday morning breakfast.  Three of the four breakfasts went back.  Two of those came wrong again.  One of those came back wrong a third time.  It took so long for the waitress to come back my wife had nibbled on it, eating around the block of Velveeta she specifically asked to be cheddar.  When we asked for consideration on the bill, we were told that she had eaten it, so no discount would be given.  We asked to see the manager.  The waitress returned and threw the bill on the table saying that she would take the breakfast out of her tips.  When we told the hostess, she offered a 10% discount off the bill.  Too Little Too Late.  There is no excuse for a menu omelet (that's right, not a special order, menu) to come out wrong three times."
1,Terrible car wash!!! Avoid at all cost!!! Put a dent in my car and won't take responsibility. Worst car wash ever.
5,"Thanksgiving meal.  My family ventured out and enjoyed a magnificent Thanksgiving meal. The museum created a wonderful menu that covered foods from the different territories of the Untied States Native American traditions.    Extremely rich and flavorful food, excellent service, reasonable price/person. There was Native American Music live to entertain the guests.  The museum and gift shop remained open and was a great way to walk off the delicious meal.   I plan on making this a tradition."
5,"This is a great place to go for concerts and sporting events. My first time here was for an NSYNC concert back in 2002 and despite having upper-level seats, we could see and hear everything just fine. There's not a bad seat in this place!

This time, I was here with friends for a Phoenix Mercury game. Fry's was giving away tickets and my friend and I were given Suite tickets! The Suite Level is awesome, but the drawback on this night was the fact no food or concession stands were open on our level so my friend had to go to the Main Concourse to get food.

We could see and hear everything just fine and I got a lot of pictures. The lighting, however, was dim so pictures came out dim but still decent.

Great venue and I know i'll be back for more games and concerts."
5,"Terry T and I watched Les Miserable at Esplanade AMC when it was showing. That was my first experience with the musical, and I was hooked. So, when I saw Les Mis was being performed at Phoenix Theatre, I was beyond ecstatic--in fact, I was slightly aroused. And who better to accompany me than the lovely Terry T. Incidentally, Terry has seen the production multiple times, so I was concerned this wouldn't hold up to her expectations. I, on the other hand, was just excited about seeing this musical (and staying out late on a work night, Tee hee!)

Now, I have to admit I started comparing this production against the movie. So I initially was thinking, ""Wait, Fontine was brunette"" and ""Hugh Jackman delivered that line differently"" before I allowed myself to be consumed by the musical. Because it truly was beautiful and masterfully played out on the modest sized stage. It received Terry's seal of approval. Bravo!

A couple of things I think really contributed to my enjoyment of this musical were 1) the lovely senior citizens who were bused in, and their darling commentary during the production; and 2) killer seats, front row stage left. They reminded me of the wicked seats Robert M scored through the lottery in San Fran for Wicked."
1,Someone in class suggested this place and it was such a let down. A large group of us went and many people liked their sandwiches but my turkey cranberry w/ stuffing sandwich was awful. The stuffing looked like dog food and it tasted like cardboard and fennel. The cranberry sauce tasted like it came from a can and there was nothing special about the bread. The upside is we got our orders fairly quickly and the atmosphere was alright for a quick lunch spot.
1,"We purchased a high end mattress that was delivered on May 30, 2011. It has become very uncomfortable to sleep on it and the concern to make it right is non-existent at this point. They have received a report from Integrated Bedding Group but so far have failed to acknowledge that report. One of their reps told me that just because it was uncomfortable didn't mean it was defective. They tell you to shop local so you would think they would care about satisfying a customer. Never again will I shop there!"
1,"Horrible Service. Food was sub par. Not as good as an Olive Garden. Expected a more authentic taste. The decor was the only positive. Again, horrible SERVICE! I do not recommend."
1,"I am a longtime shopper at buffalo exchange and I must say, this location is terrible. Staff is unfriendly, selection is awful & they never seem to buy any of the quality clothing that I bring in. I am done shopping here, completely over it."
1,This location of Verizon gave me the customer service experience equivalent  of a car wreck.
5,"Yep, like many other Yelpers, I have also come here while waiting for pizza.  I actually like the whole looooooong experience of waiting for pizza and drinking some wine before hand.  My fiance and I usually go through a bottle of wine and maybe more depending on how long we have to wait.  

Bar Bianco is a super cute and quaint place hangout.  We have had excellent service here by the bartenders and they are very knowledgeable on the wines they sell.  We tried the cheese plate once and it was delicious.  Other than that, we stick to wine.  This place is great for a date or a small gathering."
1,"Okay food, terrible, slow and arrogant service.  You guys need to change your attitude.  The server could have cared less about her service, ignored, us and the food took forever! Not even an acknolwedgement from the staff that the food was taking too long. Also, we were sat down about 15 to 30 min after our seating time and there was not enough space for us to sit to wait for our table as there are only 4 chairs - 2 back to back so I had to sit on the edge as there were several of us. After asking to get a drink a waitress shoved a menu in my face and said she would take my order and never came around. We also had to chase our check down as well."
1,"Well if you think this is Authentic and great food the Mexican cooks you know aren't very good. I went with Authentic Mexican friends and none were impressed by the food. I called it mediocre and they called it less than. To me it reminded me of Home EC, Mexican food cooking lessons of the inexperienced Jr High Student. Oh, but wait... they don't teach Home EC anymore! So grading this meal (dinner) would be difficult. At least the waitress had a cool air about her that said I don't eat much of anything here, so you can't hold my opinion up to any of this feed. That's right feed not food. 
Furthermore the decor and vibe in the place is lacking. Sitting there reminded me of a pass life experience of eating and waiting at a bus terminal."

THE VEGETARIAN ANGLE

When you can date a review to the exact day (and with good reason), you know that you're in a special place.

We ate at Payton Curry's pop-up restaurant at the Welcome Diner last night, April 19, 2011, and the following is what we ate, but you may have a different menu on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings from 5pm-close through July 4.  Chef, I hear, tries to keep it real and keep it local and fresh when sourcing his menu, so it changes each week.  McClendon's Select was mentioned more than once.

(PRICE NOTE:  On Tuesdays from 10pm-close, the menu is 1/2 price to be sure Curry exhausts his fresh produce and meats.)

Welcome Diner was serving about 12 people when we arrived, 6 at the inside counter and three couples outside dotting the front yard, set up with a picnic table, a sawhorse, some two tops, and glass tabletop lanterns.

The food came out quickly, and our gracious and knowledgeable server asked if we'd like our dishes as they were prepared or in courses. We opted for the former.  My darling dining partner and I shared all four dishes.

THOSE DAMN GREEN BEANS
We started with green beans, as crisp as they were picked, with just one tip snapped off, just like my grandmother taught me.  These were served with a citrus creme fraiche and some recently picked tarragon.  I always love dairy with tarragon, and this dish, served cool (not cold) if I remember, was dusted with local bee pollen, granular bits that taste of honey and something else and melt on your tongue.

MOZZARELLA
The menu insists there's basil in this tangential rendition of caprese -- and there probably is -- but the takeaway message from this panko-encrusted slab of mozzarella with the sweetest tomatoes I've eaten is a sweet-n-sour burst with every olive oily bite.  A standout appetizer.

GNOCCHI
If you're like me, when you've eaten or prepared gnocchi before, you assume they get plopped into the boiling salted water before the plump up and rise to the surface.  Not so fast, Barilla Boy.  Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides,   keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water.  The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell.  When eating this dish, I more than once covered my face with my hand to shield what may have been unflattering facial pangs of ecstasy.  

LEMON CURD
We struggled to choose this dessert over the Strawberry Olive Oil Cake and Strawberry Malt, but we got our strawberry fix as the second layer in this delectable parfait, topped with the airiest foamy meringue, and served in a mason jar.  The macerated strawberries made you want to relive childhood and replace mom's jelly with Payton's strawberries to accompany Laura Scudder in your PB&J sandwich.  We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen.

$62 with tax and tip.  We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time.  (The $13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.)  Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene.  Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner.

I worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May, 
June, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.

1,"Good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle. First of all you have to leave your purse at the counter. I am not comfortable doing that anywhere. Who does that? The only place I have ever seen this before was ASU's bookstore. 

Then you walk in this warehouse that has NO air conditioning!!! I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day (111 degrees out, yikes!) Then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes. 

If they had a/c it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning??? IN ARIZONA?? Madness!"
1,"I was unhappy due to having to wait 55 minutes for my one meal (steamed veggies combo with chicken, shrimp and scallops!  Then I get two pieces of shrimp, three small slices of chicken a few tiny scallops!!  For $12.00 that is a rip off, a joke and unacceptable!  You going to charge for food with those items in you better put more than sliced veggies!!  I will never come back!"
5,"In 3.5 years I have eaten here at least 50 times. I have never had a bad meal 

To say that I love this place would be an understatement. La Tolteca has the best casual Mexican food in AZ. Maybe in the entire nation. 

First of all everything is made in house. Try the Fish Tacos, they are off the hook amazing and so inexpensive that they blow my mind. Grilled Mahi Mahi, fresh corn tortillias, crema, cabbage, cotija cheese. A winner.

The Tacos de Papa are addictive. 

The Ceviche Tostada is something that I dream about. 

If you are into burrito's check this place out, awesome big rolls of home cooking. 

The Carne Asada is delicious and so is the roasted chicken. OH MY GOD. 

Try the Elotes, all the grilling is over mesquite charcoal imported from Mexico. This is where I fell in love with grilled corn. You will thank me. 

The bakery is loaded with delicious sweets. Take home a box of treats.

I love you La Tolteca. Thank you for making my life so much nicer and saving me crom mediocre food!!"
1,"We were not impressed at all. We took the time to sit down with one of their accountants and explained exactly what we needed them to do for our businesses. Spent at least an hour and a half going thru everything and provided them with all the information they needed. They told us they understood and sold us on their services - but clearly they either didn't understand or were incapable of doing anything that didn't fit into their rigid structure. A quarter later we called to follow up and we got a ""I'm too busy for you right now"" reply. Not cool. Three months after that we realized they weren't doing anything we asked and we tried to find out what happened. Instead of owning up to their mistake - they tossed insults at us and acted like our earlier conversation never happened! When we took our complaint to the owner we got a very robotic apology with no attempt to make things better. Clearly this company doesn't work well with others."
5,"While visiting in-laws for Christmas, I attended Midnight Mass at St. Mary's Basilica in downtown Phoenix, and it was one of the first times I understood why it is said that Catholics ""celebrate"" the mass.

The Basilica is a beautiful piece of Spanish colonial architecture run by Franciscan Friars, crowned with bell towers, palms, and stained glass windows.

The Christmas altar was lit with candles and bursting like a heart in love with the reds of dozens of poinsettias.

Midnight mass lasted until 2am, but was so rapt with happiness, that few seemed to mind or notice. Instead, the mass kept ascending in circles like the incense. It was like a holy party, with all of creation joining in the celebration of its Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

The mass was sung and prayed much more than spoken. There were traditional carols, Latin chants, and pieces of Handel's Messiah. The choir did wonderfully as the happy voices of those gathered were all taken up and transfigured as if by one power.

The celebrant was Father Vincente Mesi whose beautiful, crystalline voice sang out and chanted the prelude to the declaration of Christ's birth as well as the Gospel reading from the pulpit.

By 2 am the people began to stream out of the church with the bells tolling from the towers unabashedly with good news, pounding with a rebellious happiness against the tall, dark downtown buildings and skyscrapers of Phoenix. The bells sang the happy triumph, the surprise victory of love and meekness, over the pride and might of the world.

Many, though no doubt not all, felt they had encountered the mystery of a happiness and joy that strips and transcends all human understanding. Many, though no doubt not all, walked away with their hearts full of this sacred joy. Those who did were at least for a moment transformed by this eternity--this holy party which is Christmas."
1,"Noah's Ark Pet Center?? More like, Nooooo way will i ever step foot in this ark pet center.
From the moment we stepped foot in this store with our 4 month old puppy, we had an unwelcomed feeling from all of the employees. Walking into the store, you would have thought we had a rabid dog on our hands. Everyone seemed bothered that we even walked in to the store to help support the local businesses.
We went in for a simple nail and hair trim, and the groomer acted like we were a burden on her apparent busy (and seemingly miserable) life.
Nail trim? Decent. 
Hair trim? We wanted a basic trim around his face, basically so its out of his eyes. She gave him a trim that would bring back horrible memories of our childhood where our parents tried to give us haircuts, resulting in uneven cuts looking like they used a pair of rusty garden shears.

no way."
1,"= = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET  :-O  = = = = =

Ok, the old Hotel San Carlos here is serving a weekday lunch buffet, so of course I stopped in to try it.  Today was Mexican food day, & they had a small setup of 16 items, which might be ok as long as the food is good.

I started with some of what they said was Tortilla Soup, in a styrofoam bowl.  Next, there was a bit of salad, & then it was on to the refried beans, which were cold, tasteless, & the consistency of the clay we had back in grade school.  They also featured nearly tasteless chimichangas, enchiladas, & tacos.

Over at my table there was a pitcher of WARM water to drink!

The service was awful, & so was most of the food.  Factoring in price ($7.99), it was worse than Taco Bite!     :-O"
1,"My iphone 4s screen was broken and cracked on the front and back.  Got quoted $50 for each side so $100 total.  About and hour later they were done, however the guy that installed it accidently cracked the glass on the front during installation while pushing it in.  He said that was his last glass screen unless I wanted to wait a week.  He knocked $50 off the price and I paid half as the crack he made was internal and just put a small line through it from top to bottom that wasn't too noticeable and I needed my phone immediately as I was heading out of town the next day for a week.

About 3 hours later I reach into my pocket for my phone and pulled it out.  As I take it out of my pocket the front screen and back screen both come apart!!!!!!  I noticed that the guy who repaired it forgot to put the screws back into the phone that hold it together! Who does that?!  Luckily I was at the Kierland Commons and walked into the Apple Store to see if they could replace the missing screws.  They did for free thankfully, did not expect that from Apple.

Now after about a month of having the screen ""fixed"", their are two huge cracks running through the screen after my phone rolled off the couch and onto the carpet taking a massive 10 inch fall, haha.  I don't what they replaced my screen with but it has the durability of paper mache.

This should of been expected from a place that looks on the outside to be across between a pawn shop and a bail bond agency. Lesson learned, just awful.  You've been warned.  Take your chances with the Apple Store, atleast they replace the screen with Apple glass."
5,"I don't usually say this.  O.M.G.

I recently reviewed Gallo Blanco Cafe in Phoenix, which fell into the ""cleaned up but still cheap"" category of Mexican food.  Tolteca is definitely in the ""local grimy Tacqueria"" category.  And it's one of the best I've ever been to (including in LA and SF).

The carnitas burro blew me away.  Fresh, homemade flour tortilla makes a huge difference.  Carnitas were incredibly moist and tasty. Fresh guacamole, great salsa.  Everything about this dramatically more delicious than your average Tacqueria burro, while still being simple and not just trying to win you over with loads of sour cream and cheese.

Save room for dessert, too - they have a great pastelería too"
1,"Mediocre food.  Mediocre service. Sometimes you can, indeed, judge a book by its cover, and this place proves it.  I was going to write a long, detailed discussion of everything that sucked about my lunch there today, but I'll let the fact that this is my first one-star review (and I've reviewed some real dives) speak for itself."
5,"2014 - been going to Beckett for 5 years now, and I have ZERO complaints. 

Heads-up: they're moving next year, but they'll give you the deets when you have your appointment. They still provide superior customer service and a fantastic tax experience at a price that's too good to be true. So good."
5,"i rarely give five star reviews but for what this restaurant is, it's pretty perfect.  i've only eaten breakfast here (twice in the last three weeks) and the eggs are cooked perfectly, the sourdough toast is made in the kitchen and is delicious, and the bacon was perfectly crispy.  the hashbrowns are the best i've had in a long time - perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside.  the pancakes are huge and light and amazing.  the cinnamon rolls taste just as good as they look.

prices are right on, baked goods are pretty great.  service is fast and friendly - really fast.  i haven't had to wait more than 5 minutes to get my meal.  i might be in the honeymoon phase, but perfectly cooked poached eggs or over easy eggs are hard to come by!  it shouldn't be an anomaly to discover well cooked food, but i suppose it is.  sure it's a ""greasy spoon"" but how many greasy spoons bake their own bread?  can't recommend this place enough for great breakfasts."
1,Went for dinner on a Tuesday at 7 pm (July 1). Their own website says they are open until 10 pm. Their voice message on their phone says the same. Drove 30 minutes to have a meal here. Later a friend pointed out their Facebook page says they are closed for the week (4th of July week). Ridiculous to update one place and leave others unchecked.  Waste of my time to try a new place.  Won't bother coming back if they can't communicate adequately.
5,Place is fantastic! Best in Madison. For all things growing - inside and out. Nice to be in a store where employees actually know what customer service means.
5,"I've been in Madison for 10 days or so and I've made this observation: Madison residents are spoiled rotten! ROTTEN! There is nothing like Monty's back home in Boston. I dare all you haters visit its counterpart in Boston, the South Street Diner. Have a meal there and report back to me. I will have a hankie ready to wipe away your tears of disappointment. 

At Monty's today, I accidentally dumped sugar all over my french fries. Even though I'm clearly a stupid klutz, they gave me new fries anyway. My chocolate malt was perfect. Once I slurped it all up, I felt a little sad...and then I discovered there was ANOTHER malt waiting for me and I felt like a winner!

And believe it or not, I'm a connoisseur of vegetarian reubens. I've tried them all over the country in CA, RI, MA, CT, NY and Monty's in the best I've ever had."
5,"Lol don't let fellow yelpers get you down. This place is great. My family and I have been coming here for the last 10 years or so and have never been disappointed. I feel the staff is friendly, generous, and very helpful. The food makes me feel like I am back at home. Very authentic and just the right amount of spice (for me). I usually order the machaca chimichanga or machaca enchiladas. Both are excellent. They have some of the best cheese enchiladas in town and my family loves their tacos. It's quite a drive from our East Mesa home, but we always find time to make a trip down there."
5,"LOVED LOVED LOVE THIS PLACE!  It's kind of like a cafe style restaurant with a glass cheese display.  The owner is a humble Republican State Senator...after a few glasses of wine he probably gets cornered quite a bit.  

Anyway...I was on a date.  This is a GREAT date place.  We ordered pairings of cheeses and wines that are already selected for you.  We each got our own tastes (3 each).  We shared each other's cheese and wine.  The service is so so, but nothing to complain about really.  After our cheese tasting I ordered the salmon.  It was cooked very well with fresh vegetables.

Great place...and I look forward to my next visit in Phoenix to come back here."
1,"This place was gross. The pizza was bland and had no flavor, the salads were the same, but drenched in dressing and soggy. The tables had residue on them, and I didn't want to eat on them. I definitely won't be going back."
1,"Have been going to this place/location for YEARS!! Needless to say, I wont be back to this establishment ever again, after I discovered a CLUMP of hair (view in photos at own risk) in my pulled pork. Highly disappointed."
1,Would five 0 stars if I could. They never delievered my flowers and never even called me to inform me of what happened. They were just going to keep my money. Will never use them again! Though i did get a full refund from them after I called 2 days later to see what the hell happened.
5,"I came to Madison and tried out this club.  VERY  NICE for the individual price.  A warm pool, lap pool, two hot tubs, cardio/weight room upstairs, weight room downstairs, raquetball courts, you name it.  Had a great workout, and and an awesome protein shake at their smoothy bar on my way out!  Really nice staff too!"
5,I'm constantly on the search for a good breakfast burrito without meat... this place is a gem. Salsa is great and service is fast. Great for a grab and go and legit Mexican food.
5,"This is easily the best Italian food in the Madison area.  I've never had a bad meal (or even a bad bite!) on a visit to Vin Santo.

The seafood fettucini is really heavy on the seafood (they're not trying to stiff their customers!) and they basically serve BRICKS of incredible tiramisu.  Everything tastes so fresh and home-made and they offer a much more interesting menu than most ""Italian"" restaurants in Madison.

I'm so happy that this locally-owned business has found great success - they have lots of regulars (like I used to be!) who keep coming back for the delicious food, big servings, friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere.  Vin Santo is a MUST for me when I'm in the area."
1,"last weekend after some shopping my wife and I decided to get some bbq and since we where near downtown phoenix decided to stop at HONEY BEARS BBQ  what a mistake, do these people even know what barbecue is, if you plan on goin there you better pack a lunch bag the wait for your mediocre bbq is ridiculous and the people that work there seemed like they all had a bad day, there is a sign that says for you to check your order before you leave when we did some food was missing it took 3 of the employees to agree that our order was not complete so we had to wait longer to get our whole order, will we go back ""HELL NO"" you can try it if you like crappy food"
1,"Avoid this place at all costs. My boyfriend went here for an allergy test. He called ahead to make sure they accepted his insurance and when he left they told him he was all set. Two weeks later he gets a bill for $507! That's AFTER his insurance was charged. 
A call to his insurance company revealed that they charge more than twice the local average for the tests, and his insurance wasn't going to cover the excessive cost.
Save your money, go somewhere else."
5,"Come on people, it's Mr. Roberts. It's a dive bar, it's stinky, dingy, sometimes scary and that's the way it's supposed to be, to keep the squeamish out. Quit being haters, there are plenty of white-washed established to frequent for the faint of heart. As for the crap tap beer-order a bottle. I for one am thankful that shit-holes like this exist."
1,"I arrived on time for my appointment and had to sit in the waiting room for over  a half hour with a blaring kids  movie playing on the waiting room television.  The waiting room was not very clean and the furniture was worn and outdated.  While I was waiting, people were being rushed out the door who had just had their Lasik procedure done.  The staff were walking them out telling them their aftercare plan in front of the whole waiting room.  When the ""sales girl"" finally called me back into a room she did not apologize for the wait.  She only said, ""this is surgery day.  We are busy.  We tried calling to reschedule you (I received no such call). Then she made me look into a machine while she looked at my eyes for about ten seconds.  She then led me to her sales office to talk pricing. She gave a very lengthy sales pitch and did a poor job pretending to listen to my concerns. I am nervous about having this procedure done and she made me more nervous.  She made it seemed like I needed to have the procedure done ASAP before my eyes got worse.  Then she made a morbid comparison to Lasik being equivalent to cutting her finger off.  Then she pushed a finger down and modeled to me what her hand would like missing a finger.  She would not offer specifics on pricing and kept throwing out numbers and percentages.  She made me feel rushed and like I had to decide today if I was going to go with them for the procedure. She discouraged me from using another form of payment other than their financing and kept throwing percentage rates around as to why she was right.  I asked for documentation stating the pricing and discounts available to me and she declined to produce any such document stating, ""This is not like buying a car.  I am not giving you any written pricing.  Anyway, the pricing changes all the time.  These are your eyes we are talking about and you only have two (like I didn't know that).""  She created a huge sense of urgency with getting the procedure done and kept repeating, ""You only have two eyes.""  She kept telling me what ""most people"" do, which is pay the day of the consultation and get the procedure done the following week.  She also told me she needed a $100 deposit before I left today if I decided to go with them.  I told her that her sales pitch was making me feel uncomfortable and rushed as I am in the early stages of exploring this procedure.  She became offended, defensive, and moody claiming it was not a sales pitch and that ""I only have two eyes."" She would not even continue the consultation and have my eyes tested to see if I was even a ""candidate"" for Lasik without my committing to pay.  I then said that I felt their company was not a good fit for me and she led me out.  I do not recommend this company based on my consultation experience.  I would not trust them with the actual procedure because they seem very concerned with getting people in and out of there as fast as they can to make $$$! If you do get the procedure done at this place, you should not pay more than around $1500 per eye because that's the final price I was verbally quoted at my consultation.  But, like the ""sales lady"" said...prices are always changing! This company needs to train their sales people on how to effectively communicate with clients, build trust, and be empathetic!! Oh, and give clients documents on pricing!"
5,"Get out!
(No seriously... get out.)
Nothing beats a brew in one of Madison's best beer gardens. With a shady roof overhead (love that newer addition) and tables for you and an army of your friends, this is quickly becoming my fave locale for keeping hydrated."
5,"This place gets top marks from me.   The food was delicious and prices are very favorable.  The service was very polite and prompt.  I asked to add tofu (NOT fried) to my eggplant/Thai basil dish.  Normally I get arguments about not frying my tofu (I really, really don't care for fried), but not here.  The chef expertly prepared my meal.  The seasoning and sauce was really nice.  The sauce was just the right amount.  If I had to say one thing... the rice was a little sticky, but I can totally see past that because the overall meal was just great.  I enjoyed the left overs the next day."
1,"Not a very good place at all.  Be very careful of this place as they tack on all kinds of move-out charges.  They make you show a receipt that the apartment has been ""professionally cleaned"" when move out.  I had my neighbor clean the place as she did an exceptional job.  Because she is not a registered cleaning company, they charged me $130 for not having a registered company clean the apartment.  Also, make sure that you pay rent before the first of the month if it falls on a holiday.  They charged me $75 for not paying them on time because they were closed on the first of the month.  Because they decided to close on the first, they charged other tenants and I $75 for supposedly paying late.  Be very careful if you decide to live at this apartment complex."
5,"I have always enjoyed this establishment and have eaten at maybe 12 of them all around the country. I only have gotten one dish through all these years and that is really the only reason to go to OSF - get the mizithra spagetti with browned butter. Now that prices for a full meal have nearly doubled (for dinner), the best time to go is during lunch. You still get a giant hot loaf of sourdough bread with real butter, salad or soup and entree for $7.99. Originally, our waiter said the ice tea and desert (scoop of decent sherbert or average spumoni) was extra, but I guess he was feeling nice and he offered those items for free. This cheese is really good when combined with the butter and it is always one of my fav dishes and never had a bad meal at any OSF across the land (west of Nashville only). 
    Yeah, its an old building, but this is one of the original factories and that lends some charm. Love the spaghetti tree up front and they even have an old school phone booth (with closing doors) to sit in and remember the good ole' days of pay phones and rotary dialing."
5,"Top notch doctor in a top notch practice. Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country. 
It is really easy to get an appointment. There is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is great."
5,"One of our favorites.  I love that you can walk right in on a Friday or Saturday night without waiting for a table - I don't know why that is, maybe the location?  But the food has always been phenomenal.  The seared tuna and fresh veggies is so good and the portion is twice the size I've ever gotten elsewhere - so it's a great lunch the next day.  Chips and salsa are the best of anywhere.  The chips basket is a mix of white and blue corn, PLUS fried wonton wrappers with a sweet/spicy spice blend AND sweet potato chips.  Sooo good.  And it's a great, roasted salsa too.  I've had dinners, salads, quesadillas there and everything has always been good.  I'd always take my assistant there for secretaries day or for their birthdays and they always love it.  We've had out of town visitors and they always love it too.  If you love calamari, there's is great.  IT's cornmeal dusted with a spicy sauce... but there's TONS... so bring friends.  Really.  Usually a calamari order is $10+ and so small you don't want to share, this is under $10 and enough for 5 ppl.  Delish.  I LOVE that they bring you a white chocolate (and pecan) tamale after dinner.  Just the perfect little two bites of sweet to finish your meal.  Consistently good food."
5,"Wow. 

1. Best beef brisket I've had in my life. 
2. Awesome, awesome ribs. 

I love BBQ and this place is the real deal. When I saw the ""no 1"" in the name of the restaurant I laughed because that's a tall glass to fill and I was prepared to tear them down on Yelp if it wasn't true, but they blew me and my taste buds away. 

I could go on, but let me put it this way: Next Monday I'm flying into Madison for work for what will likely be my last trip to WI for a while. My coworkers and I have already agreed that we're driving straight from the airport to get lunch. Now I just need to decide... ribs or brisket?

(Note, I went twice so that I could have both the ribs AND the brisket :) )"
5,"This place sets a new bar for complimentary chips and salsa. The chips are a cornucopia of crispy warm blue corn, white corn, four, sweet potato, and wonton style flavors sprinkled with yummy seasonings. The freebie salsa is thick and delicious, far beyond freebie grade.

The Grand Canyon frozen margarita was tangy and superb. First time I've had a margarita dressed up with bits of fresh orange zest.

The table-side guacamole is pretty good. I think I'll ask for extra spice next time.

The outdoor seating s great...overlooking the courtyard mini waterfalls & fountain."
1,"Walked in on a busy fish fry night for the first time.  No hostess spot, so we wondered around until a waitress barked at us to go to one of the bartenders.  The bar was two people deep so that was nearly impossible.  Maybe the food here is that great but we left after feeling very unwelcome."
1,"Years ago, this place had some great food! Now, not so much. Chicken Fried Steak is bland, the Salad has very little ""greens"" to it, and the apitizer bread they serve is cold. They used to have the best CFS around, but in the last few years or so, its beaten out by a Denny's dinner."
1,"Unless you have time to waste, don't go to this nail salon. Even when you make an appointment, they take clients up to the moment before your appointment so you have to wait 45 minutes.

And when you show up (on time) they don't tell you that your appt will be 45 minutes later, they just tell you to pick a color so you have no idea that you will be waiting forever. By the time you realize what's going on, you have already been there so long you can't go somewhere else to get nails done in less time. 

Try kens nails instead, no matter when you show up, wait is never more than 10 or 15 minutes so they don't even do appts. They are in the Safeway shopping center on Indian school around 48th st.

Or Biagio at 16th st and Glendale. If you make an appt there, you will be seen at the appt time. 

Both are a lot cleaner than dv nails which is extremely dirty."
1,"I'm comforted to know I'm in good company with those multitudes of folks who have been ripped off by this arrogant, sleazy dump that thinks of itself as some kind of a restaurant.

Out of frustration at finding something to eat late on a Friday night a few weeks ago, we went into this place because it was handy.  The floors were littered with papers, trash and crumbs, the tables and chairs were in disarray and looked like they hadn't been washed or wiped all day.  I've seen junior high school cafeterias right after lunch that were more inviting.  

The sandwiches we ordered were OK.  One was supposed to come with dressing, so I asked for it on the side.  A large, overfed bozo yelled from the back they can't give it on the side - either take it on the sandwich or do without.

When the sandwiches arrived, my dining companion's arrived with a cup of the very same dressing I was told was not available.   When I asked for the one that should have come with my order, Big Bozo yelled it was too late - I already accepted it without.  I showed him the one we were just served, and he yelled back that was all we we're going to get.

He then walked up front to where we were seated and told us to get the hell out.  He refused to refund our money but changed his mind after we threatened to call the police if he didn't.

Most Dominos owners take their franchises seriously.  Too bad the drug-addled stumble-bum who runs this sewer doesn't.

Home Depot sells toilets for s**t like this, and, as far as I'm concerned, ALL Dominos are long overdue for a final flush.

UPDATE, February 21, 2014:  

On this date I filed a formal complaint with Domino's Corporate headquarters.  I received a very sincere, heart-felt reply, indicating they would take care of the matter and we would be hearing from someone within three days.   

Nothing from Domino's was ever heard from again.

Gee, what a lot of rock and no roll...  

You REALLY think this is an efficient way of appeasing abused customers - making them jump through all kinds of ridiculous, impossible website hoops, ifs, and, buts, exclusions, etc. just for a measly $10 discount off $4 worth of cold pizza?  

I'd be impressed if you reported back to me with the corrective actions you took - and then simply mailed me a coupon of substantive value.

Since this incident we've learned just how low Domino's public image has sunk, and the reasons why.  And this flaccid effort at improving Domino's customer relations is typical of Domino's go-to-hell attitude.

Keep your valuable e-card and thanks, but no thanks."
5,"I came in with a free wash voucher after having my vehicle serviced at Ford. One of the guys who oversees the final wipe down of the car, inspected it once it came out of the wash, and said he wanted to put it through one more time because it was still dirty. They took the extra time to wipe the car by hand, and put it through the wash once more. Definitely more than I expected from any car wash facility... especially when I didn't even have to pay!"
1,"I went to Danny's this weekend to get an oil change and car wash and I paid for a VIP car wash.   After picking up my car I was disappointed that there was still dirt on my car floor.  I later noticed that money I had in my car for parking was missing.  I'm highly upset that I paid for these services, tipped the staff, and had my property stolen.  I've been going to Danny's on and off for years as they are close to my home but I will never frequent their establishment again."
5,"I have been a loyal customer here for 15 years. The staff and food are great. The prices cant be beat, especially during lunch hours. A great variety of food from seafood to vegetarian to meat and poultry dishes. This is truly a Phoenix gem!!"
5,Amazing place with good good.  Great prices with food too match.  I really enjoyed the place and atmosphere.  The noise level is high so be prepared to enjoy the festivities.
1,"We were downtown, and my kdis grandma use to take them there all the time.  Out of nostalgia they wanted to stop here.  So we went in got a booth and I was SHOCKED!  There was literally trash and food all over.  I was going to ask for another booth and looked around to see they were all like that.  We ended up leaving, I mean can you imagine what the kitchen looked like. Not one person asked us why we were leaving or anything.  We just walked out."
1,"This place has a great location and I can't complain about the price, but it is gross.  Really, it is gross and broken down.  There is always broken equipment.  You may have to hop machines a few times just to find one that functions.  They stopped giving you a towel so no one wipes down the equipment...ewww!  They never have paper towels or sanitizer in a place that is full of bodily fluids...ewwww again!  I remember the good old days back when it was ""the Q"" club...clean and fresh.  Can't someone please buy these exercise slumlords out and bring back the good old days!!!"
5,"I needed a place to cater an event for my work and upon my search for ""boxed lunches  that deliver,"" I found Zoes. I didn't want to give folks a typical sandwich boxed lunch and needed something that would appease carnivores, gluten free folks and vegans alike and I feel like Zoes Kitchen was perfect. Working with their sales manager Marissa made the whole process super easy. Their boxed lunches were great! I went with chicken kabobs, veggie kabobs and chicken green salads and was so impressed with the presentation. Delivery and set up was great! The delivery girls did have a spill and 2 veggie kabobs didnt make it but I appreciated that they were honest about it and I was refunded. Zoes had no problem in individually packaging all 110 of my orders. They even brought along some nifty coolers with ice for drinks and all of the necessary paperware/plasticware. They accommodated to my party's needs (chicken and pita bread on sides for vegetarians/gluten free folks). I had the chicken kabob lunch and it was so good! The chicken was flavorful, the salad was refreshing. I was also very happy that I decided to order some of their cookies because they were such a big hit! Everyone at the event raved about the food, so I definitely know who to call the next time I have an event in Phoenix."
1,This Starbucks has been remodeled and now looks like a hospital cafeteria. Gone are the plush velvety sofas and over-sized chairs which I loved to sit on while flipping through a good mag or chatting it up with a pal. No more warm and fuzzy feeling Starbucks. I hate this new look and will not be back EVER! BTW - The place was empty at 10am on a Saturday. Hmmm?
5,The Vegetarian Hash is a must have !
1,"Gross.

Desperate, I ate here and regretted it about 10 minutes after finishing and for the next 24 hours."
1,"Mediocre pizza, HORRIBLE service.  We told the waiter that we were in a hurry and it still took 45 minutes to get the food.  We had two minutes to eat it and it was boring.  Then I got to argue with the waiter, so that was fun.  Go to the Parlor.  It's got better pizza and WAY better service."
5,"Nice people, not a bad selection, and close to home. If I'm running low on supplies and it's to early to call it quits, this is where I go!"
5,"go there every other day, I love the food, not too expensive, and the ladies are awesome. always a smile on their faces. taste and attitude is what I rank this at. sucks that they close around 2:30 though. and a nice place to chill, they have tv and wifi. rather take them than most the places on Central, bunch of snobby people working in the business' on central so it's nice to find a spot that is inviting."
1,"Usually very pleased with Tee Pee, especially before a DBacks game. But tonight two really disappointing things happened. First, we arrived about 40 min before the game and the main wave of people were already gone. We were alone in the dining room and I mean alone - as in no waitresses for 5 minutes. Beer glasses were warm (they'd just been washed! We were told) and only 2 small bowls of chips for 6 people. Most disappointing, though, was that my grandfather forgot his jacket in the booth when we left for the game. I called 20 min later from inside the ballpark and was told it couldn't be found. After the game my mom scoured the place and it was still MIA. Very sad to think it was taken."
1,"Don't bother- bad food, non-attentive staff, snobby management. Why bother...... the food is mediocre at best. Zeezs at 2nd Ave and Jackson is superior in every category. I agree with previous reviewers and think that possibly with a new staff and management the place could be salvaged...

RUN don't walk from Alice Coopertown!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I won't even venture to guess why so many people like this place. But a few notes: no, it is nothing like a European cafe; no, it is not an actual wine bar; yes the service absolutely sucks.

We came here for a friend's birthday party. Her mother had arranged ahead of time for 10 of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor. But before that, let's start with parking. 

You can't park in the residential streets because you need a permit. Fine. I heard they had a valet and there's nothing on their website about parking so, whatever. I head to the valet who asks me if I am dining at Postino's or La Grande Orange. I say Postino's and he says ""Ok, that's $3."" I asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant I was going to and they wouldn't answer. I asked if there was an ATM since I had no cash and they told me there is one but it doesn't work. I got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about 15 minutes. Fantastic.

When I get there, about 6 girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them. Finally, a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said ""Those are yours. Those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they're not done yet. We told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they're still there."" Ok, so now we only have two of our four tables. Great. Finally they seat us at our two tables. Another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo. She pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away. Upon her return I asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a Malbec. She argued with me about that for a few minutes until I pointed to the label. She said ""Oh"" and walked away. I never did find out if we were supposed to have the Malbec.

At this point, the other two tables had been cleared. No one brought any other glasses or put the tables together, so we did it. Also, no one opened the other bottles, and yes they were screwtop, but still. So I opened them. Finally, everyone else arrived. We still only had 4 wine glasses. After trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded, rudely ""We don't have any more."" and walked away. I had to ask three different rude, uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still, not everyone ended up with a glass. 

Seriously? Anyway, the bruschetta came out. While the menu offers a lof of different ones, they are all so deplorably bland and under-seasoned that they felt unfinished. The fig, marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced. Dry, flavorless. Most of the bread pieces weren't even cut all the way through so we were all man-handling the pieces to get them apart. The bread was obviously just grocery store bread and I doubt anything is truly hand-made. The issue is, the quality of their ingredients sucks. They obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up. Everything, even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy. 

And as for a wine bar? Seriously. A joke. They have a half of a sheet of paper, one side, as their wine list. No flights, no tastings. But for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by over-priced glop and wine in a trendy area, they'll continue to do just fine. I will never be back."
1,"Came in with my son and nephew.  Asked if I could add Chicken to a salad and first I was told no, and then I was told that I could but it would be  an additional 5.99 if I wanted chicken.  I have no problem paying extra for an addition however 5.99 is quite excessive.  Well I orders a medium cheese pizza for the boys and I will eat when I get home.  The customer service here was terrible.  It is no wonder the place was empty.  We will not be back and I will spread the word about what a great experience we had."
1,"disappointing.

server was nice and pretty attentive but that's about all good i can say about this place.

we ordered an appetizer of mozzarella sticks that were pretty decent but nothing to rave over.  while we were still eating them, our tomato basil soup arrived so i had to juggle which one i wanted to eat before they got cold.  it turns out, i didn't much care for the soup so that was an easy choice.

mid-way through the appetizer/soup course, viola!  our main course arrived.  i admit, it's a pet peeve of mine to get food before i'm ready for it.. so that's a big part of why this restaurant is not my favorite.

however, the dishes we got weren't particularly good either.
i got the spinach chicken ravioli with marinara on three and alfredo on the other three.  the chicken didn't seem quality and it was stuck in the raviolis in chunks and it distracted from the consistency of it as a dish.

my beau's steak was inedible.  his first bite was gristle -- so much so that he had to spit it back out.  he only managed to gnaw through half the steak .. and i think he did that only because he was so hungry.  he asked for it medium-rare and it came so rare that, if it was me, i would have definitely sent it back to be cooked more.

overally, i was just disappointed by benvenuto's.  
bummer."
5,"If I could marry a restaurant it would be this. Or maybe Taco Bell, but if I don't want to have a trailer trash wedding than definitely That's A Wrap is a better marriage partner. Their food is DELICIOUS. And their berry lemonade stuff is my fav. I love that all the wraps can have tofu substituted for the meat and its not a huge hassle. A lot of places servers stare at you and can't seem to wrap their heads around the idea of substituting other things in place of meat in the dishes. Here it is totally common and not at all shocking. I love that. The wraps are huge, the sides are delicious and the place is really cute the way it's decorated. Too bad I live so far away or I would be here on the daily. Seriously, stop reading this and go there right now. And if it's not open then camp out until it is, it's that good."
1,"Terrible place to shop!!! The manager is an expletive i cannot say on here. I went and bought several nails and screws as well as a rug and other items. While i was checking out the cashier charged me incorrectly for some of the screws, actually charged me more than what they were so i told the cashier and she corrected her mistake. While shopping i was there for about an hour because i was looking at paint, i even talked to a guy while i was there about different paint options as well as another lady about drill bits and about my cat condo project. anyway after i left i realize after i got home the cashier had also forgotten to give me a receipt. the rug i purchased did not work where i wanted it so i attempted to return it about 1 week after i purchased it, i went back the following weekend and the manager refused. i have never heard of refusing to return something or even give a store credit. im not one to return stuff so i was completely shocked. when i put up a stink with the manager she absolutely rude. i will never go there and the reason is that this location along with several others are individually owned and because of this they can make up whatever policies they want. so back to Hd or Lowes i go. never again!!"
5,"Excellent customer service and high quality of work here are worth a little extra driving for me to get my car washed. Most importantly for me, it's one of those places where I don't feel like I have to strip my car of all possible valuable items or papers with personal info when I get out and hand the keys over."
1,"A big fat FAIL to this Schlotzsky's location!!!! .
I went to order something for my office and did so online. but for some reason the company they use for group orders some how some way got messed up. so Schlotzsy's never had my order. So after almost an hour of waiting I  called them and they  didn't even have my order. so they took it and an hour later we got the food. Then the next day I get a phone call saying i did something wrong and could i fix it so they can get there money. So i tried and it kept  kicking me  for some reason so now not only do they want there money they wont me to take time out of my work day to come down and pay for it at the store. Really!?!  I tell you customer care and service right out the window. I will never ever order from this location again!"
1,My sister was treated so rude. I called the front desk in a very professional manner to address the issue and see what was going on and how to resolve it.  Instead of her treating me like a human being she decided to be VERY rude and unprofessional with me as well. Every question I would ask she would say she's not gonna argue to me. I didn't think we were arguing. She was so rude that I had to ask if I could speak to someone else who could speak with me professionally (I thought this was automatic at a business. Why did I have to ask?) There was NO MANAGER available until Monday so I guess until then they can treat people however they want. I've never been to the office but the way I was treated only over the phone is a good enough reason for me to never step foot in this office. If you want to be treated disrespectfully and not like a  human being then go there. Otherwise go somewhere else. I still can't believe there was no manager to speak with. I would give zero stars if given the option.
5,Went here during first friday and it was a madhouse. I'm assuming things run a little smoother when the line isn't out the door so I give them the benefit of the doubt. Food is amazing all the way!
1,"Terrible experience! The staff there was extremely rude to us the entire day. I will never come back to this golf  course or recommend it to anyone. If you would like to have a nice experience, choose somewhere else."
5,"Awesome store!  Had the Acana Ranchlands dog food that I was looking to get Cheppie and PItzie.  It's funny b/c the two people who helped me also give their food Acana Ranchlands.  I was able to convince two shoppers to change to it also from the crappy food they were giving their dogs.  Good prices too.  Not the best, but good."
5,"Ross, I hope you're going to show up somewhere else. Sure miss you in SP."
1,"First off,I feel I am friendly and easy to get along with, but this was the worst ""bartending experience"" I have ever encountered! [It was Thanksgiving Eve 6:15 in case the owner/manager might read this]. Either I was 1] not a regular or 2]a bother. NEVER again!"
5,"Great find thanks to Yelp! My family and I were at the Convention Center for my niece's dance competition and we didn't know where to eat. My sister mentioned that she felt like Mexican food so I pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app and began searching. This gem popped up.

It's about a 10-15 min. walk from the Convention Center and is located in the Arizona Center near the fountains. 

I ordered the vegetable pasta, my sister and mom ordered veggie fajitas and my dad ordered the applewood smoked salmon. The fajitas looked really really good! They had various kinds of vegetables in them, not just peppers and onions like some other places do. My veggie pasta was really delicious. It's pasta with a garlic black bean soy sauce. It's topped with roasted vegetables. The only thing is i wish I knew that there were tomatoes in it because I would have ordered it without. Not a big deal though, since I was able to pick them out. My dad's salmon was fresh and he said it was delicious. We didn't order dessert, even though their deserts look AMAZING. They have something called a banana burrito, which looks really good. This restaurant also has a gluten free menu if that's how you roll. 

Our server Ryan was really good! He made sure our drinks were full and brought us new chips when our basket was empty. He was very attentive and made sure our visit was superb. BTW, their tortilla chips are out of this world. 

We sat outside on the patio and overlooked the lit up palm trees and the fountains. It was really nice out and our visit was very pleasant. There was also some live music playing. The food took a little long to come out but it wasn't ridiculous. You can tell everything was prepared fresh, so I didn't mind having to wait an extra few minutes...plus my dad ordered an appetizer which delayed things a bit. 

Next time we go back I'll definitely try the table-side guacamole...that looked really good and probably tastes really fresh."
1,"I've been going to Danny's for years. I would take one car, fill it up, get the Works wash and go back for the 2nd car, at least weekly. Have always been pleased with the finished product and thought it was a good value. The employees were top-notch; Friendly, efficient, had a passion for their jobs. 
In the last 6-9 months there has been a dramatic change...zombies for employees, the service is very slow, crappy job on the cars. 
Sorry Danny, you have lost a loyal, formerly happy customer. 
Now I need to find a new place!"
1,"I purchased a 18 X 36 print recently that I planned on framing. I stopped in Aaron Brothers even though I was planning on going to Michael's.  The lady there was very friendly and knowledgeable. She helped to choose a mat and frame. After everything was decided, she ran it through the computer and said the job would cost $675.00. I thought I must have heard wrong. She said it was correct and that it would normally be $975 but she was applying a 30% discount. I asked if we could look at an off the shelf frame. We picked one. The price of the frame was $32.50 and with a mat and labor it came to $185. Still more than I expected, but I decided to do it. She informed me that it could be ready July 30th, exactly one month. I laughed as I was leaving the store. How the hell do they stay in business? I did notice that there were two employees present and one customer, me. No surprises there."
1,"Warning: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE! Terrible service! I've had multiple items on the menu, and they've all been below average. BTW, if you're looking to have a burrito with the usual items (meat, lettuce, tomato, rice, beans, etc) be prepared to have 1 menu option (The 3 lb burrito) that runs you 13-15 dollars, and MORE if you want grilled steak (of which they will give you 5-7 SMALL pieces). Margaritas are OK, but be prepared to wait."
1,"First, the good stuff: the staff are really nice.

That being said, the units are ghetto. Burglars smash and grab in broad daylight. Domestically violent neighbors require police assistance in the night hours. The door locks are a joke. Snow removal seems to be done on an ""at will"" basis. Units haven't been renovated in decades, aside from the incidental balcony that needs to be brought up to code -- seriously, is this carpet original? The water literally takes 5min to rise in temp from frigid to lukewarm, and another 5min to rise to shower temp. All the sockets are so old and worn-out that plugs fall out under their own weight -- WTF?

It could be worse I guess. I could live next to a crack house."
5,"Corned beef hash, please marry me. You come with eggs, fruit, and a delicious biscuit. You are potatoey and oniony and wonderful. 

Coconut cream pie, you make my booty more bootylicious. Mmm."
1,"I usually only buy beauty products at a department store or Sephora but ULTA is a lot closer, I run there when I'm in a jam.  I would consider the shopping experience here a small step up from Walgreens.  It has the necessities but not the items you never knew you needed.  Very small selection of brand named make-up, skin care and perfumes.  Over priced hair care and hair accessories.  I'm always bummed out when I walk around.

As for the staff, can't stand them.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by other places that like to tell you what's new, which items come with gifts or help you pick a color.  Nope, not ULTA.  There's usually ONE girl working the register, no matter how big the line.  The rest of the staff is coagulated by this counter in between the make-up and hair salon.  I have no idea what purpose that counter serves because they're all clustered around it, putting make-up on each other and gossiping about the girl at the register - you know, the one actually working.  The one time I did actually pull one away to ask for help with liquid eye liner she handed me one of those pencil eyeliners that don't need to be sharpened.  Ugh, thanks for nuthin'."
1,Some girl I know said she went to China Chili and it was the best Chinese food she's ever had. After she told me that I went to China Chili the next day. The menu is standard for a Chinese restaurant nothing special. We ordered some beef dish for our meal and a side of chow mein. The beef was chewy and the chow mein was bland. I do not understand why people love China Chili. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy!
1,"I have been a customer for many years. I ALWAYS get the VIP carwash. The VIP carwash includes WASHING THE CAR, correct?  And the windows, and vacuuming the inside of the car? And cleaning off the door and window sills? 

The last two times I have been at the Highland Avenue location I have had poor service. Today was (again) a poor experience. Even after specifically asking that they clean the bugs off the front end (assuming they would do the rest of car without being asked) I still had to ask (again) at the end to please wipe off the bugs.  Last time the car did not even looked like it had been washed.  Just the top/superficial dirt was removed. 

The attitude of the workers is that they are doing me a big favour by wiping off my car - and I always tip when they are finished so it's not like I am being overly picky. Additionally - when you have three or four workers all speaking Spanish and all of them looking at me, snickering, pointing at the car and then looking at me, laughing and the young lady actually rolling her eyes; well being rude to the customer and not making me feel welcome when the car was not clean is inexcusable.

It was just after 8:45 this morning that I was there.  You were NOT busy - there was not a big line and you had plenty of workers in the finishing area.  Seems like 4 or 5 guys were quite happy to work on shining up a large white Humvee that was there for over 30 minutes while the (less than) 10 minutes spent on my Mariner was half-hearted and sloppy. The mirror inside was dirty and pushed all the way to one side - I thought the idea was to put the mirror back in an approximation of where it was when the customer gets back in? Both seats in front were moved and the passenger seat was wet. The center console area had not even been cursorily wiped, and the areas inside all the door and windows was filthy and looked to have never even been touched,.  This is the same sloppy work the last time I was there.

I have had to ask a couple of times in the past to get the car wiped down better -- 18 dollars and I cannot even get a clean car? Lately there seems to be no one outside managing the lines or workers. I pull in -- no one bothers to look up or point me to the lane they want me in.  Someone else pulls up after me and they get waved into another lane and serviced before me. 

I specifically ask that the front end is wiped down and all the bugs are removed. The young man checking me in assures me this will be done and he writes a note on the window. I do not stand out there and watch every move they make - I assume the car will get vacuumed out and then sent through.

So today:
Front end is filthy after wash and I have to ask AGAIN that they clean it
Rude and disrespectful employees laughing at me is not a good way to do business
The center console has not been wiped and still has dirt in it from when I pulled in. 
The passenger seat is wet.
The inside of all the doors sills and windows sills are filthy and have not been touched at all
The water dripping down from the door seams and from around the back window streak up the finish by the time I pull across the street to Trader Joe's. I saw them happily blowing all the water out from the Humvee - I guess no one bothered to do mine.
  
I should not have to go back AGAIN and spend another 30-45 minutes waiting for them to wash it right. They should do it the first time without me having to ask specifically.  Especially for 18 dollars.

I am extremely unhappy. I have tried to contact the management.  Let's see if anyone cares enough to email or call me back. Otherwise - do not go here. EVER."
5,"5 stars for: creativity in food/taste combinations, ambiance (excellent musical choices, artwork), service. The first thing the waiter did was adjust our table (it was a little wobbly), then dim the lights out a little. He gave us his honest opinions, gave us enough space. We ate he crabcakes, the meatloaf, the rellenos and farm salad. All were delicious with unique flavor combinations. Oh...I almost forgot. It was my husband's birthday and the waiter added a little candle to this heavenly chocolate cake. Perfect evening. Highly recommend-and we are from San Francisco where we unfortunately become restaurant/taste snobs!"
1,"I gave Croque TWO shots and will not be ordering from them again... 
They are close to my office and have brought us delivery menus on numerous occasions so I thought I would give them a try. 

The first time I ordered for delivery my food arrived FAIRLY quickly but was delivered by a woman who WREAKED of cigarette smoke.. needless to say after she left the smell lingered in the office because the paper bag my food was in also wreaked of cigarettes.  I emailed the business and received a kind response stating that this would be taken care of and was not acceptable... So I gave them another chance.

The second time I ordered from them my lunch took an hour and 45 minutes to be delivered. I am completely aware that lunch time can be swamped, as I have been in the industry before, but almost 2 hours for a salad and a side of french fries is RIDICULOUS.  And to top it off, the same woman delivered... and she still wreaked! 

It's too bad that their service is off because their food is great and they're so close to my office!"
1,"Further from the airport then you would think. The airport shuttle leaves on a 30 minute schedule but don't count on it. Called down to confirm that they were leaving at 6 am but when I got downstairs the shuttle wasn't there.  Front desk offered to call a taxi but the taxi they supposedly called didn't arrive before the 6:30 shuttle left for the airport(at around 6:38).  

Don't rely on the airport shuttle to get you to your flight on time and call your own cab if you need one.  $20 to the airport via taxi.  There are closer options."
1,"Stopped in during happy hour for a light bite and a drink. Sat at the bar and ordered a glass of their house Cab. With one other person at the bar, you'd think the service would be reasonable. The only other time I saw the bartender was when my glass was empty. I ordered another thinking she'd offer me a menu at least...never happened!! So I paid requested my bill and went somewhere else to eat. Btw, my bill for 2 glasses of ""house"" wine during happy hour was more than $15!!! Other servers appeared to be much more customer-focused."
5,"Stopped here for the first time last night and was very pleasantly surprised. I had the teriyaki bowl and edemame, both were great. Very nice staff. I'll definitely be a regular customer now."
1,"Someone please put this theatre out of its misery!  It was good in the 1970s but not anymore. Cramped seating, minimal leg room, and not many restrooms. Yuk"
5,"We were at IHOP for Easter breakfast because our big plan for going to Matt's Big Breakfast was squashed when we drove by and discovered that they were closed that day. So, a little disappointed, we turned around and hit the IHOP on Central that we had passed 5 minutes before. We already knew the quality of the food would be fine, as all IHOPs are fairly consistent. But what impressed us was the friendliness and happiness of the staff that morning. We walked in and were cheerfully greeted by Anita at the front register. She looked around and seeing all the staff was busy, she bussed a table for us and sat us immediately. We were impressed right there. Then we were served by Kamal, who was super friendly, attentive and in a great mood. But it wasn't just the 2 people we had direct contact with. Must have been the Easter spirit or something, but the whole staff seemed to have smiles on their faces while we were there. We kept noticing and commenting to each other how odd it was to see happy restaurant staff (how sad is that?) I can't remember the last time my boyfriend and I went out for a meal and called the manager over to tell her that we were thrilled with the service. On a $22 check, we left $35. Well worth it."
1,"I wish you could give 0 out of 5 stars.  
This was one of my favorite bars... Loved coming here because it is the only gay ""spots bar"" in the valley but will NOT return after the awful service we received.  
After ordering drinks and reading the menu we noticed our server had left.  We waited for 15 mins before going up to the bar to request service.  
Seems weird that he just left without saying anything, especially giving the fact we opened a tap
I asked another server at the bar if he was taking over for our server. He replied ""yes, be there when I can"".  After about 10 more minutes he came to our table.  He was pretty aggressive and it was very obvious he was not happy about having to serve our table.   He asked ""what do you guys want"".  We ordered and after he asked how we would be paying. I told him we had a card already open.  At that point he just walked AWAY.  Didn't read our order back, didn't ask if we needed new drinks (my beer was completely empty), didn't thank us for ordering... he just walked away. 
He continued to serve people around us.  He stopped to check his phone serval times but never came by to ask if we wanted more drinks.  
We waited for twenty minutes, our food never came and our server never returned.  I closed out with the bar tender, who seemed oblivious to what was going on and we left.  
Will Never Return."
1,"I have lived in this complex since June of 2009.. I chose it because of the descent prices and proximity to work. Generally I would say I have been pleased with living here but the longer I have stayed the more learn and the more I want to move out. 

Things I learned after moving in or since: the store owner of the internal 'market' was murdered a couple years back by a tenant.  Within he last year a female tentant was raped mid-day by two indivuals, two different instances of tenants dying from drug overdose, 11 first floor apartments were broken into in a month and had their flat screen tv stolen

A friend of mine had his computer stolen from his car while parked right in front of a security camera. The front office has not been helpful or concerned about this. Their initial response was that 15 new residents were moving in and they would not get to the tapes... a couple days later they stated corporate would have to review the tapes. It has now been almost three weeks and they still have not contacted me regarding any of this.. I realize theft is a problem every where.. but they clearly don't care about my concerns. 

Other (Non-safety) issues: 

Pool maintenance.. The pool near my unit was shutdown by the city for the majority of the year last year. All winter the pool was shut down the the point ducks moved in..then in the peak of pool season they finally drained it to re-tile and make repairs.. but the time it was open again pool season was nearly over. Other pools are frequently dirty, without operable chairs, or the key to enter has been changed. 

Lights: Many of the lights around the complex are burned out or broken.. The light by my unit is out, it was replaced a couple months back and burned out almost immediately.. I am specifically not calling to report it to see how long it takes for a repair. 

Cleanliness: Many of the tenants, (myself included) have dogs. There have been periods of time where everywhere I look there seems to be dog poop and all the bags to pick it up are gone. I have also noticed a lot of the tenants toss chicken bones into the grass and bushed around the grills. I have seen trash/dead birds/grass clippings/vomitt left for days at a time. 

Oh and if you choose to move in and then wish to leave.. you better save up if you want to break your lease it is going to cost you BIG TIME"
1,Should have known better than to eat in a place so dark that you can't see the food on your plate. Underwhelming and overpriced.
5,"Took my fiancées car to the Octopus as little get well present from an untimely mirror vs garage accident.

At first you may feel some sticker shock when you see the prices however, you need to have an idea before you pull up if you want either a full service wash or the pricier fast detail service.  Don't worry, the friendly service advisors are not on the hustle. The staff is very honest and even handed me the iPhone I forgot on the seat as I got out of the car.

The Diamond Package is your best bet and unless you are have a real messy car, your sure to get a good, through wash.  The staff works endlessly from the time you pull into the wash bay to the time they help with the doors when you get back in to pullout into the street.  They even wipe down the dash and clean the insides of the windows.

The only thing I forgot to mention is that the Octopus is kid friendly for all ages (myself included). Make sure to let the little ones blast the cars with the ""sudszilla"" as they roll  by but, don't be shy about taking a turn yourself =)"
1,"Not only was the food mediocre, but the staff was slow, unknowledgeable and incompetent (although very nice, so sorry about that guys). 
First of all, I have celiac or in lamens terms, I can't eat anything with gluten (wheat, oats, rye, barley) in it. So here I am at this kinda cute (kinda dumpy) diner with my boyfriend and I ask to see the allergen menu. So they come out with a packet with like 8 point font after a about a long wait, lovely. Then, our server takes about 15 minutes to ask us what we want...I ordered my meal, and substituded mashed potatoes for a side in order to keep gluten free. Just to be sure however, I asked our server if the potatoes are freshly made, she said YES. 
Well, I eat one bite of mashed potatoes and minutes later I am sick. So I went to the front to ask somebody, and three of the staff members sit there and argue about wether or not the potatoes are fresh and the kitchen is literally RIGHT BEHIND THEM! Hello, just turn around and ask! 
Finally, as I'm about to puke (sorry if that's TMI) one of them says ""there's our manager go ask her."" Uh, rude. So I do and she informs me that they are in fact not freshly made, they come in a package and probably do contain wheat contrary to the gluten free menu. So of course, my boyfriend and I pack up our food really quick, I tell her they basically just poisoned me and her response was to pay at the front. Awesome. Needless to say I will not be going back there ever again. 
What can I say that's positive about this place...(honeslty I'm not typically a negative person!) Well, they do look 50's, I'm sure it would be great place to take kids, and although I have a bad taste in my mouth about them not giving a crap that I just ate something I'm basically allergic to, they are friendly. So there, hope you enjoyed a small ray of sunlight in this negative review..."
5,"On the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I went to Comedor Guadalajara for supper.  I can't pronounce it but I found it.

It doesn't look like much on the outside, but it is quite comfortable and nicely done inside.  From the chips and salsa at the start to the blazing hot main course, the food was great.

I had a burrito, taco and cheese enchilada combo plate with rice and refried beans on the side.  The burrito was huge and tasty, the taco crisp and filled with fresh lettuce, and the rice and refried beans were tasty. The enchilada was so-so and it was the only disappointment.

The service was fair, a little disappointing given that it was not that busy.

The price is excellent for the food you get.  A real value!"
1,"This is an interesting property that is attempting to be nice in an area that is a mixed bag of new/old/and just plain worn out.  The hotel is attempting to remodel and is doing a fair job at it.  The furniture is new, beds new and bathrooms remodeled.  There is a no smoking policy, but the lobby smells like smoke and the manager who talks about the non-smoking policy smells like a giant cigarette.  

The part where this goes bad is the management.  The main manager does not deal well with the public and I'm really not sure how this place is still in business with him running it.  

Pay the extra $40 (I did) and stay at the Marriott (Springhill Suites) one block west on Van Buren.  Quiet, clean, big rooms, hot tub, friendly staff, big breakfast, store on site so you don't have to cross Van Buren and worry about the sketchy Circle K across the street.  I do not recommend this NOT-SUPER 8 motel."
1,"Poor food handling practices!!! I was really excited to try this place as the reviews were excellent. Major disappointment! We arrived just before noon and the place was really busy. They were still serving breakfast but we were interested in lunch. We asked our server to see what the lunch menu to see all our options and she seemed annoyed. We ordered a couple of beers and they were prompt but not really cold. While we waited about 30 minutes in order to be able to order lunch, we had a lot of time to observe things. I was appalled to see the filthy salt, pepper, ketchup, and mustard containers. They looked like they had never been washed. I also watched the bartenders clear dirty dishes off the bar, then dig their hands in the cherry jar. The last straw was watching the woman cooking touch a handful of raw hamburger patties and then immediately touch the buns on the grill. Last I checked, those practices could send someone to the hospital! We will not be going back!"
1,"I used to enjoy coming here as I have enjoyed their food over the past five years. I work nearby and used to recommend this place to new employees and students on rotations at my job site.
The food has remained pretty consistent over the years but the customer service has fallen way below satisfactory. There are a couple of employees that seem pleased to help you as you place your order but the older man who has been there lately is just not friendly. I have tolerated it lately as I've enjoyed the food over the years but today was the last day I'll go back. 
He is rude, unwelcoming and does not understand basic customer service.  Today, after standing in line with six others, he took the orders of the five individuals in front of me. As soon as he took that fifth order he walked around from behind the counter as if I wasn't even there in plain view, walked past me and proceeded to pick up trash off the floor, wipe some tables down, then walked past me once again, never acknowledging me, to grab the trash bin and baskets.
As he approaches the counter once again, I ask if he is going to take my order and he says, ""do you not see I'm doing something?""  I ask again what he said in case I heard him incorrectly and he repeats himself asking if I did not see him doing something then proceeds to tell me I am rude. I say you clearly don't want my business and I left. 
This is no way to treat a loyal customer of five years with many referrals to your business. Very unfortunate."
5,"bought a camera and a lens here a few weeks ago and i am nothing more than 100% pleased with everything about this place. Judith is amazing and so knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Morgan is very helpful and knowledgeable as well....both have been a great help to me in the process of getting my new camera.
they have a wide selection of camera bags and accessories, filters, tripods etc...everything really that may need is there. They dont have a whole lot of cameras but they do have lenses you can choose from new and used :-) 
if youre in scottsdale or looking for a great photo store....DEFINITELY CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!"
5,"Our new favorite place to dine! We have a difficult  time deciding what to order on the large and tempting Southwestern menu. The appetizers are also fabulous...the fried calamari is the best, served with a creamy spicy dipping sauce... large portion....enough for two as a meal. The prices are reasonable and the staff have become our friends. The surrounding outdoor area is beautiful, with fountains and twinkly lit trees. The cafe is located in the Arizona Center so a nice place to walk and shop after dinner.
Ask any ASK ME AMBASSADOR (those guys in orange are great and know what's best in Phoenix) and they will direct you to Sam's."
5,"I crave this place, I dream of their Peking Duck. Better than sex, well maybe not better, but a close runner up. Went here with J.W. and a number of other friends for my birthday; great fun, fantastic food! Don't let the hoody decor scare you off, experience the Gourmet House!"
5,"Awesome place to go. Their motto says it all, ""little place, big flavors"" or something like that. It's just really really good."
1,Absolutely the worst service I've ever seen. We waited for a half hour before grabbing a waitress.
5,"Buck's is our go-to pizza place in Madison.  Super thin crust that is simply delicious.  No frills (no seating), just fast, good, tasty pizza.  Good price too.  We are never disappointed."
5,Great hospital!!! Been here with my boyfriend for 3 days now for seizures and they are doing there best to figure out why it's happening. The nurses are amazing especially his night nurse Karen. The doctors are doing their best that they can to help him. I will definitely come back to this hospital.
1,Wings were old and dry and gross. Burger was burnt to a crispy and loaded with beyond old lettuce.They forgot the zucchini and mushrooms but im sure they would have been equally gross like everything else. This place is disgusting. If you wouldn't eat this food yourself then don't serve it to your customers.
1,Went with a friend who remembered it being good from years ago. The service was barely adequate. I ordered the $10 Asado burrito. I kid you not there was 8-10 small peices of cut up steak. That was it. The rest of the burrito was onion. It was so bad I actually got sick and threw it up when I got home. I can't believe the ridiculous prices for a small amount of food. I could have made that entire meal for less than $3 at home. I'll never go back. And I'll make sure to let all my friends know not to bother going at all. Very Disappointing!
1,"DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING TO THIS PLACE TO BE REPAIRED. THEY ARE THIEVES. I took my Honda push lawnmower there because it would not start. They ended up putting a new carburetor on it and said it was fixed. I took it home it sat in the garage. I did not use it because I just moved and planted grass. I took it out of the garage to use a month later only to find out it would not start. I took it back called a few days later and they said water was in the gas but, it was fine now to come get it. I travel alot so, I had hired a landscaper to do my yard. I left the mower there for a couple of months they called, I said I would get it picked up. My son went to pick it up last week only to be told it was thrown away because it had a bad crankshaft that we must have hit a rock or something with it. So, since we took so long to get it they threw the mower away."
5,"i love this church!! I found it before i moved to phx and saw that pope john paul went here, how many churches have been visited by the pope in america not many!! Made my three wishes, and love that the door is always open to pray. Also the stained glass windows are amazing!! I go here after my downtown hospital rotations or if I'm in the area!! I also like that they have afternoon mass at 12 and a mass for the deaf how great is that!! love this place a must see phx jem!"
5,"I recommend you stay here if you need a hotel in the area. Comfortable and clean. Stayed here two nights. Breakfast is always really good and really well stocked and FREE. On certain weeknights they serve FREE BEER. FREE BEER. 

The service at Staybridge is always stellar and this location did not disappoint. Kenny deserves major props. He was really cool.

Internet worked great (free too) and everything in the room was in working condition and clean. 

The sitting area in the lobby was a happening place and very relaxing to kick it and watch sports. Nice place."
1,No one cleaned our room. And it reeks like cigerate smoke. Will NEVER stay here again!!!
5,"Now called 'Moka' I believe, new management, they cleaned up a lot of the menu and consolidated it. Not nearly as many choices as when it was Java Detour. That said... 

Absolutely love this place! Sadly it is on the other side of town so we seldom get there but the quality is fantastic. High quality coffee, quick and easy to grab and go. Not expensive at all, I would go there every day if it didn't take me half an hour out of my way."
5,"The BEST macaroni and cheese anywhere. It doesn't seem possible that a classy upscale place like this with a fabulous wine and cheese list would have incredible macaroni and cheese. Ken knows what he is doing here and even though the food is every bit as good as the food I have had in Paris, his desserts will cause you to give in and forget about your diet for the day.
Ask your server which cheeses are at their best and simply have a glass of wine to go with it if you like.
If you order coffee it may take a bit as they always make it fresh when I am there.
Worth the drive, wait or ruining your diet for."
5,"Two Words. Holy Basil !!!
p.s  thai spicy..."
5,"Screw the dealership! Bavarian is where it's at. 1/3 the cost, friendly, and BMW parts. They replaced an ignition coil for my 325 and had it done by the end of the day. I'll be getting my service done at Bavarian from now on."
5,"My favorite lunch spot. Fresh food, amazing fruit, great fries and friendly service!"
5,This is one of my favorite lunch spots. I have gone here regularly for a couple years and always order from the specials. Try the shrimp enchiladas or the fried red snapper. They are great!  Some of my friends drive all the way across the valley to eat here.
5,"I've been going to this Mexican food restaurant for years! This place has by far the best green chili in phoenix! Also the staff, and service is excellent! One more thing, if you like menudo... The red menudo is by far the best I've ever had!!! This place is a staple!"
5,"Harbor Athletic Club is great.  We use it all the time - swimming classes for the boys and yoga, pilates, and cardio classes for my wife.  No classes for me, but I still enjoy the club.

Membership dues are right in line with other major clubs in the area.

Highly recommended!"
1,"My words in this review will most likely not convey my disappointment with this establishment.  However, I will try my best.  I dropped off a prescription Tuesday evening.  I pulled up to the drive-thru and waited at the window for over 5 minutes without being acknowledged.  Not a ""hi, we'll be right with you"" Nothing.  I wasn't in a hurry and understand that these places can get crazy busy so I waited this time without pressing the ""Call for service"" button and when I finally did, waited another several minutes before I was rudely greeted by a younger girl who looked like she would rather be doing anything at that moment besides helping me.  I then gave her the prescription and it took her another several minutes to tell me that they would have to order it and it wouldn't be available for me to pick up until that Friday!  I was a little upset that I needed my medication and would not be able to obtain it until then, but I figured what can I do, and agreed to be there Friday to pick it up.  Upon arriving Friday after work, I was in a hurry to get home and figured they had plenty of time to get it good and ready for me by Friday afternoon and assumed it wouldn't take more than a couple minutes.  First off, they only had one of what I had been expecting three of, THEN they wanted to charge me over 80 dollars for something that has always cost me 10.  I said that there must be some mistake and the ""kid"" behind the counter said he didn't know what to tell me except this is what they are supposed to charge according to my insurance company.  So I left, extremely upset, without my medication.  Then I called my Insurance company and I was told that CVS was wrong and I was only supposed to pay the 10 dollars as usual.  When I went back, I was prepared to sit and wait as long as it took in order to get my medication at the price I was supposed to be charged.  I ended up spending over an hour in the CVS this time until they finally figured out they were wrong.  I ended up leaving that day with my medication which I paid the amount expected from the beginning and left with a smile on my face and at no time was rude to the ""less than educated"" workers behind the counter because while I waited for them to fix their mix up, there were several customers who were presented with similar situations, all of which were not nice to the staff.  This however is no excuse for them to be little punks and not give a crap about people, this is our health we're talking about and it should not be dealt with by a bunch of dumb dumbs...  I will most likely be going elsewhere next time I need a prescription filled."
5,"Grab lunch with M.  Our second time together here, and I have gotten togo before too.  LOVE this little cozy place.  The customer service is wonderful.  I got the terriyaki chicken bowl, gyoza, and an ice green tea.  The owner lady, we call ""mama san"", always out to greet us and make sure our drinks are topped off before we leave.  

I need to come back to try something else beside the terriyaki chicken!"
1,"Still on the quest for good Mexican food, I tried this place with a coworker who swore that I would love it.  Not so.

We went at lunch and the waiting area was packed!  We put our names down and they called us 10 minutes later (not bad for how many people were waiting).  They have a large dining area and lots of parking.

When we sat down, they brought us chips and salsa and soup.  The soup was yummy.  The chips were disgusting -- you could taste the grease that they were fried in (YUCK!).  

I ordered the beef taco and cheese enchilada lunch special.  The taco was decent (very small) and the cheese enchilada had onions in it which were crunchy when you bit into them.  I thought I ordered a cheese enchilada but I guess they forgot to put cheese AND onion enchilada on the menu.  I still judge a place by it's beans and these were nasty.  You could taste the lard.  My coworker ordered the chile relleno and chicken enchilada lunch special.  She didn't like her food either.  

After we left, she apologized and admitted she would probably never go there again either."
1,"I didn't spend quite enough time in here to give this a totally legit review, but when me and my friend walked in, it was darker than most clubs inside, the place was very small and very packed with creepers, and the girls didn't take their tops off. They just wore what looked like bikinis. 

I just think if you go to a strip club, they should show you their boobs. Maybe they do and we just didn't stay long enough to see it, but until I see different this place gets a 1."
5,"This is just another diner with good breakfast food. The real value is the view. This diner sits right along the runway of a small airport.

I ordered the Chili Cheese omelet w/ hash browns. I recommend paying the upcharge to get cheese and peppers tossed into your hash browns. 

I loved the view and would go back the next time I'm in Wisconsin."
5,"Comedor Guadalajara is probably one of, if not, our favorite Mexican traditional Mexican places.  We don't usually order the regular Mexican food you can get at any place, we tend to order their specials.  Those dishes might be a little more exotic than most people are use to, but they always leave us full and delighted.  When the Mrs & I go, we often get the Tres Carnes platter or order of the specials for dinner.  When my cousin  and I go, I almost always order the Tripas de Leche......nothing better!!!!!   I have never seen them on a menu anywhere else.!  Gotta try them!"
5,"I will never lie to you yelpers about what is great and what isn't.  The Antiques Mall of Madison is great.

First of all, you have to WANT to be there, because I doubt you would be driving to that crappy strip mall for anything else.  (I do like that chinese place out front though).

The owners leave you alone as you browse, an you could be in there all day!  It's my one stop shop for rolling pins, doilies, vintage easter decorations and old chairs.  Because, you know, I'm usually out looking for that stuff."
1,"This place sucks, no other reason to come here cept maybe for at t shirt other than that not worth a trip here, did I say it sucked?"
1,"While this CPK is largely like the others, it does have one thing to distinguish it: really terrible service. 

I was here for lunch the other day and noticed they have lunch specials where you get a soup or salad and one of a selected number of small pizzas. I ordered one but asked if I could substitute the soup offered for another kind of soup that was on the menu. I told the waitress that I had noted that the soup I wished to substitute cost $0.50 more and that I would gladly pay the additional charge.

She said she could not do that. No substitutions.

So, I asked ""why?"" esp. as I was willing to pay the difference.

Her reply (it's a classic): I might tell other people.

Huh? What? I might tell other people I got what I wanted? That CPK allowed substitutions? That they, too, could get what they want at CPK?And does she really think I have long ranging discussions about my lunch soup choices?

I tried to argue my point, but, quickly, realized that there is no arguing with that sort of unassailable logic.

Yep, I might tell other people."
5,"Love coming to the Herberger. this is definitely one of the best places for an amazing dose of art, culture & entertainment in downtown Phoenix!  Performances for all tastes, ages and interests.  Affordable and all seating is good seating - a rarity in theaters.   This is definitely a gem of Central Phoenix."
5,"Went here for the first time last night. Thought i'd give it try based on the ratings. Im originally from the south so i was a little aprehensive about trying it, but thankfully i was totally suprised! Husband had the red beans n rice with smoked sausage, i had the shrimp creole and we got a half order of wings. Everything was excellent and very authentic. Although i will warn you, it is not for those with sensitive mouths! Cajun is spicy food and this def lived up to that! Will be going back"
1,"I live in a town that has a half a dozen of the finest record stores in the country, so I'm spoiled.  But I always enjoy seeing what other places have to offer, so when I spotted Circles while riding the light rail, I knew I had to check it out.  This is by far the worst record store I've ever been in.

They do have tapes, so if you're coming here in your time machine from 1985, I guess you're in luck.  Or they do seem to specialize in hip-hop vinyl.  Not that they have a lot of it, but it is the only vinyl they have.  The rest of the store is a misorganized mish mash of overpriced CDs.  The store is huge, it could be a kick ass store, especially given the location.  Unfortunately as it stands, I see no reason for anyone from music snob to casual CD buyer to ever shop here.  Unless all you have is a tape player."
5,"Staff know their stuff, excellent coffee and food just one door down, family-friendly. Foosball, couches, toys, choices, choices, choices."
5,"This may be the nicest, most relaxing B&B my wife and I have ever stayed in.  We have stayed there about three times when we make an annual pilgrimage to Madison for a gardening conference at Olbrich.

It's in a farm house lovingly converted to a B&B.  The owners are lovely, friendly people and excellent cooks too!  One morning we were the only couple at breakfast and the food was fabulous!!!

Their dog was present while we had breakfast; that makes it seem more like home.  I wish that the llamas would come over to the fence so I could pet them.

Check out their web site at speckledheninn.com"
5,"Fun, Festive, Inexpensive, Selection, Culture, Taste, Energetic....

The Ranch is a great place, but be prepared for crowds, I don't know of a time we have been there that it hasn't been busy, but Christmas time ... Ay Carumba!  The produce, the meats, the Cocina, the Bakery, the selection is all amazing... even if you don't live close, bring a cooler with some ice in your car to get what you want/need and then feel better about taking it home!  

Be sure to try their resturant (on West end of the building) Tradiciones!"
1,"Fate has great food, but lacks on every other level. I live three blocks away so its upsetting to see a place with so much potential fail."
1,"My part Jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out. Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here...diarrhea lots, shit my pants once... anyway, i like to eat in divey non-american cuisine. This place aint seedy enough for me, I suppose.

I did not get ill from the food here

However....

 $12.95 for a sandwich, fries, and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ???

I kept hearing from my friend, his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE.
nope.

Thought we might split one.
nope.

My sandwich was flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread.

$29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!). I only had $40 (only ?)

Left the waitress $5.

Gave my friend the other $5 to put toward a plane ticket to New York where he might experience Kosher (and a bit of his heritage) on a more realistic scale.

..the fries were good tho."
1,My friends and I went to Cheuvront's for AZ Restaurant Week and every single one of us was disappointed. The service was terrible; it took 20 minutes for our fourth (who arrived a few minutes late) just to get her water. He disappeared for 15 minute stretches and only asked if needed anything when we were done with our courses. The food was overpriced for the portions--and this is coming from a graduated culinary student who has had it drilled into her that smaller is better--and the flavors were bland. One person's bisque came to the table cold and my creme brulee tasted as if they'd forgotten the sugar. Not to mention that it was so loud we couldn't hear each other. All around disappointing.
5,"This has become one of my favorite spots downtown! I keep going back and probably always will as long as they never change! I've been for late night dinner, Sunday brunch, happy hour. The service has been consistently good and the food is amazing! This is no ordinary bar menu. You can have an actual dinner. Prime rib, chicken, salmon, burgers, wraps. My favorite is the Bourbon Steak Wrap! It's just that it's too big for me to finish! Every day of the week they have specials and they are always hosting parties, events, etc. Guaranteed there is something for everyone. The staff is great! Ray and Jeff the bartenders are professional and still fun! There is a nice patio and I've heard there is also a big upstairs room but I've never been up. Next time. Lots of TVs and plenty of room for large groups. Clean bathrooms, live music some nights and even a DJ on Friday nights I think. Brunch menu is unbelievably good! I had mimosas of course to quench my thirst. : ) Hits the spot-especially after a night of drinking! AND the deserts they have are even delicious! There is a lot more I can say and I am pretty picky about the places I like. Definitely go!"
1,Came here last night; NEVER again! Worse customer service EVER! I rather play music in my car and sit there instead of going to a place where your opinion as a customer means nothing. This place does not care about the people or the service they provide- they rather lose cliental before they satisfy you as a customer.
5,"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. 
Their appetizers are great, their entrees are great, and their chocolate chip cookies are to DIE for.

Yes it is a small place, but we call that atmosphere!"
5,"I work downtown, and this is one of our regular haunts on Fridays when we go out as a group.

I typically get the Skyscraper on an onion roll.  It's piles of corned beef and pastrami, topped with swiss, on an onion roll, then served with french fries and a pickle spear.  The guys and ladies behind the counter are always awesome, and they even come around and pick up your trays when you are finished!

Though it's not the cheapest lunch (around $10-11 for my lunch with a drink), it's not out of the normal range for lunch downtown.  And you will never go away hungry.  This is definitely one of those places you will go and need to take a nap after lunch.

I can't recommend Downtown Deli enough, it's one of my favorite places to eat in Downtown Phoenix."
5,"Saw the Arena Bowl featuring the Rattlers who lost in the last 2 seconds. Even though the event was heart breaking the venue was amazing. It was very clean, the suite we were in was well stocked, had a great view, and made for a very enjoyable time. It's the only Arena we have and it's a great one. We should be thankful that we have such amazing venues to watch our Arizona teams play at. Support Arizona sports!"
5,Foods great!! Try the burrito al pastor with green enchilada sauce!!! Atmosphere is OK but its what you would expect from traditional Mexican food place. Would defiantly go back
5,"I love Cafe Zoma. I just discovered this place about two months ago and have visited about a dozen times since then. I really love the outside yard in the back where there are several tables and a play area for kids. This is very important to me since I have a one year old and a two year old. I also love the access from the bike path. I would highly recommend a smoothie, they are great. However, if I go in before work I usually get a Cubano, cause I need to caffeine to help wake me up in the early mornings. I've also had two different sandwiches and both were very hearty and delicious.

When I go I'm usually there between 7am and 8:30 am and I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for my drink. I will actually come here over Starbucks when I'm in hurry because Zoma is always quicker.

I'm giving five stars even though I have had one problem with a drink I ordered not being hot enough, not even close to the temperature of the times that I ordered the drink before. However, I'm am not counting that against their rating since the employee I talked to about it was great and offered to give me a free drink the next time I came in.

I think that have a great staff and great customer service. If you haven't been I highly suggest you stop by sometime and give it a try."
5,"Hoi Op.

Learn it. Order it. Love it.

It's mussel soup. I don't care if you don't like seafood, you will love this. You might think it's just sauce that the mussels are served in. It's soup. You will drink it, and you will wipe up every last drop with your fingers. There is nothing else like it. I'm serious. This is the stuff late-night cravings are made of. 

The pad thai is good, but you can experiment here, ask the waitress for ideas, and know that you'll end up with something different and exciting. There are a few dishes that are acquired tastes (I'm learning to love wild boar), but because I eat here, I get to say ""I eat wild boar!"" and it makes me sound like a better person. And I'm pretty sure eating wild boar does make me a better person, at least to Lost groupies.

My main criticism is that they can sometimes hold back on the heat. It's not enough to say you want it hot. They'll assume you mean ""American hot."" Make sure to specify ""Thai hot."" The burn is good.

You must save room for dessert. This is essential. It will show you another side of Thai you may not have experienced before. I wouldn't go here just for desert, but drinks + dessert = win.

The inside is white tablecloths and candles. This is where you take a date, where the hostess will make sure you're happy and the waitresses will keep your glass always full. And you can see the kitchen from every table, so it feels like you're taking your date to a favorite neighborhood family restaurant (you are, and it is).  The only problem is the bar, which usually has a few sad people at it. I like to think it just adds to the neighborhood feel.

The patio is fun, with great seating arrangements, misters, and a vibrant atmosphere during the evening (don't sit here for lunch). It can be a little difficult to get service on the patio unless it's already packed. If you're with friends who want to hang out, choose the patio. It's great for spending the evening, with good drink service and lively conversation going on all around you.

Finally, this is on a light rail stop, so there is absolutely no excuse not to make it part of your night out."
5,"This place is cute, very comfortable inside and the staff is really nice :)

I got a breakfast sandwich and a white chocolate mocha both were so delicious!! skip the starbucks and head over here, I would highly recommend this place!"
1,"I've visited this location numerous times. While I understand you need an appointment to get any help at an apple store, this place is always mayhem. The staff member that assigins you an apple member is most likely told to lie to you in order to keep you waiting as long as possible - before you completely lose your patience.
I got to the store at 10am on the dot expecting to simply buy an iPhone 4 and get on my way. The place wasn't busy at all, and I had no questions. Just charge my card $395 for the phone and mobile me, take my info and i'm gone, right? Not so fast.
I walked out at 10:45. They said they would help me right away, and I stood waiting 25 minutes until I could be helped. Three times I was told ""someone will be right with you"". The last guy that helped me was nice ,but that didn't makeup for the experience.
It's sad apple is such a profitable business with such awful, understaffed customer service. If there was another option out there that was comparable, it would be a no brainer to switch."
1,"never again. i've given't tom's two tries - because in fairness, every place has an ""off"" night. tonight was the last time. we were there at least 25 minutes. we ordered drinks. drinks never came. we left."
5,"My husband and I love this little gem of a neighborhood bar. We are constantly on the hunt for best ""bar burger"" (so we have a lame hobby...whatever, it's fun!) and we agree that Villa Tap is one of the best bar burgers in town. Jenny St ground chuck, fresh veggies on the burgs, good bun, also they have good apps (love the cheddar broccoli bites)...all good so far. Good Bloody Mary's too. We haven't tried the fish fry yet, but it's on the to-do list. We actually went there for Valentine's Day - wanted to avoid the crowds, in the mood for a good cheeseburger, etc - had a great time. The burgers were top-notch, jukebox is great (they have a weird abundance of live Dead, which is great). The regular customers are nice and friendly also - it's not an intimidating ""townie-bar"" (hello, Tip Top!) but the regulars are SO nice and fun to talk to. Owner Chico is really nice, and we love that he's going out of his way to buy local ingredients and beer. He's got House of Brews on tap even! Unusual fact - the inside of the bathroom stalls are painted with chalkboard paint and have chalk available to write messages. We really don't have complaints at this point. We're excited to try their brunch soon!"
1,"The wait staff were non-existent, the food was atrocious, the mixed drinks weren't drinkable, and the atmosphere was filthy. What more can I say? Ick."
1,"The owner and her husband are god awful.  We
went for the first time last night and it's pretty obvious that she has a drinking problem/can't hold her liquor.  She ended up calling me a f*cking b*tch.  I'm sorry, but last time I checked- it is NEVER okay to talk to a customer like that. I would steer clear of this place.  I definitely will not be visiting here again.  Which is extremely sad because I really thought the bartenders were very nice."
1,"Grade: F

A complete nightmare. Awful food served by stupid staff. Can I get another helping of second-hand smoke with those stupid mini cheeseburger appetizers?"
1,"Recently, when we've shopped at JSM, we've had the unfortunate experience of returning home, excited to use/or are in the midst of using a product, whereupon we notice one of the following: 1. Far past the expiration date; 2. Poor quality; 3. Stale. Of the expired items I can recall, one was a package of tortillas, purchased in the last few days that expired 12/09/13! Almost a full month past expiration! A month ago, I bought hummus. It didn't look right when I opened it (mold), & of course, it had expired 2 weeks earlier. Fortunately, we didn't eat the hummus. Unfortunately, we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner. 

There've been a handful of instances where rolls/breads are stale, particularly from the bins by the registers. Rolls weren't just hard on the outside or a day past fresh-baked, we're talking inedible. It's incredibly disappointing too, when you're looking forward to good bread. 

Then there's the deli, where there's been a few issues. 

Deli issue #1: My wife bought sliced deli meat, a cut known for being fatty, but this one was overly so. It was slimy, chewy, tough, flavorless, & ultimately inedible. It was the first time I've returned meat. I'm a carnivore. I've had hackepeter, steak tartare, tripe, chitlins, sheep brain, sheep testicle... things most people won't eat. This particular deli meat however, was a few steps beyond. 

Deli issue #2: More an observation, which now prevents me from buying from the previously liked, pre-made deli salad section. One time at the deli counter, I saw a JSM worker ""clean"" the front of the pre-made salad case, from the inside, with a towel. Mind you, none of the salads were taken out of the case or covered for the cleaning process. So when this worker brought the towel back out of the case, I was aghast to see a dirty towel, with all sorts of crumbs, crumbles, food pieces & products, being carried haphazardly, over uncovered salads. I saw some bits fall from the towel, over the salads, as it was brought out of the case. 

Deli issue #3: A JSM worker cut slices of meat & cheese, kindly packaging them with care. However, he did so without gloves & without washing his hands. I was pretty much done with the JSM deli at this point. 

You can have all the locally produced, environmentally friendly, organic, small batch, artisan &/or handmade, gluten-free, nonsense all you want. It does no good however, when it's stored in unclean, unsanitary conditions, &/or expired all together. If I were a ""freegan"" I'd say this place was a rip-off. Everyone knows you can get spoiled foods in dumpsters behind most grocery stores, for free. I'd also make exceptions for small ""mom & pop"" businesses, but I have standards & limits. JSM has surpassed both. It's unfortunate since we like the place, or rather, we want to like it, but there are just too many problems."
1,What the hell is that smell inside the store? I was in there at the beginning of June...and it smelled like the sewer came up into the store.....I didn't think much of it...until two nights ago....although the smell was not as strong...its still there! My GF thinks I talked myself into smelling it again.....but I do not think that is the case. Its bad enough I don't feel safe for my GF to shop there....but it has to smell like poo too?
1,Horrible. Don't go to this location. They don't follow the parent company's lead.
1,"This is my uncle's favorite Chinese place in Phoenix...and I have no idea why.

It's a little junk Chinese food spot...but it begs the question: ""Isn't Junk Chinese at least supposed to taste good?""

I mean, I know what I'm putting into my body isn't actually good for me, but Gourmet House of Hong Kong makes the act of eating it not even pleasurable...so what exactly is the point?

The spot isn't very clean (the bathroom=complete ew).  The noodles are gummy, the tofu is rubbery...The sweet and sour sauce was kind of good, but I think it added to my stomach ache (which began mid meal).

The crunchy things they'll give you if you ask--those are good.

Crunchy things and a semi-doable sweet and sour do not a restaurant going experience make."
5,"My parents and I were so satisfied with this restaurant that i don't even know where to begin.  First off the chips and salsa were amazing.  They had three kinds of chips.  Wonton's, Regular chips, and Sweet potato chips. I got the chimichanga and WOW so freaken gooooood!!!  I would definitely get it again! At the end of the meal they give you a corn husk filled with white chocolate(not a tamale, like everyone keeps saying) which was very quite delightful. Also the setting was so beautiful.  I have never been to a place that gorgeous before and to top it off my parents hate sitting outside but this place they rather of sat outside then inside! lol.

P.S. I went in January of 2012 just forgot to finish my review. =]"
5,"Wonderfully charming place filled with attention to detail and comfort food!

It is perfect for large & small groups. The food is very reasonably priced and the environment is appropriate for adults and children alike. 

I love the wooden floors, the cable car that sits in the center (it's a treat to be seated inside!), the separation of dinning areas into different rooms that provide large groups a measure of privacy & the small tables for 2 that all have plush and unique chairs.

This location is on Central, directly across from the light rail. Unlike most restaurants in the area, it has a very large parking lot. Not having to worry about parking makes meals here that much more enjoyable :)"
5,"The Inferno plays goth, industrial, etc music.  Great place to go and dance, and there's plenty of eye candy.  Wednesday nights are nice and small, and Leather and Lace is good if you like dancing around a lot of people.  Sabbat de Sade is fun for public BDSM. Sometimes there are cool live bands."
5,"""The Green"" has the best burgers in the Madison area.  It's simple bar food, but done perfectly.  They know what they are doing here and they are doing it good.  The Nachos are pretty awesome too.  They deep fry tortillas for the chips.  If you can, get a spot at the bar.  It's good times.  

I don't eat fish, but some of my friends and my girlfriend do, and they like the fish fry on Fridays.  I'll stick to my cheeseburger."
1,"Everybody who thinks about coming here should go to the real Giuseppe's, in Scottsdale.

I grew up eating at this location pretty much my whole life. So many great memories of the spot but unfortunately the change in ownership left this place with shoddy food. 

Everyone who rates this place above a two, please do yourselves a favor and try the location in Scottsdale (13610 N Scottsdale Rd). The difference is stark."
5,"Another amazing show from Actor's Theater!  
A terrific story and completely enthralling performances by the cast.  We were lucky enough to see opening night ,and everything was Great. If you are a fan of the arts, love theater, or have been thinking of taking in a live show, this is a must see. You'll be hooked!

5,I treat myself to this every once in a while as an indulgence.  Food is fabulous. Best Philly Cheese steak in Arizona.  Always fresh ingredients and they ship in specialty items in from Pennsylvania.
1,Closed down
5,"We're from the San Francisco Bay Area visiting the Phoenix area.
One of our regular stops is to the Honey Bear BBQ (done this for years).....and it's always the same: great tasting BBQ and friendly service.  We now have all of our friends come here on their visits to Phoenix and they share the same sentiments."
1,"If the stale retirement home setting and stuck-in-the-80's styled menu don't encourage you to leave before ordering, waiting for the amateur service will.

Oh, you're still here? Ok, go ahead and order any of their so-called omelettes. Be sure to also ask for lots of napkins because you'll be crying when you finally see the nonsense that comes out of the kitchen.

The way I see it, cooking omlettes is very simple: you take good ingredients, mix them together, cook it all without burning. Somehow they manage to ignore all of these suggestions. Yes, even the ""mixing"" part. They apparently manufacture a plain omelette on one side of the kitchen, and then lightly sprinkle on whatever ingredients right before serving it.

When paying my bill at the front I was asked, ""How was everything?"".
I replied in a polite tone, ""O.K.""
Cashier boy responds in bewilderment, ""Just 'O.K.'?!?""
I finally leave him with, ""I'm being nice when I say 'O.K.'""

I'm sticking to Taylor's, Matt's and 5th Avenue Cafe for my weekend breakfast."
5,"I go to Blue Fin for lunch with friends almost every other month.  Locally owned and the little Japanese lady (we call her ""mama"" san) thanking everyone for coming and making sure your cup is full is awesome and one of the main reasons I keep going back for more.  Food is great for Japanese fast food.  I just tried their coconut shrimp and it was awesome!  If you are hungry try the terriyaki chicken , rice and salad combo, yum!!"
5,"We tried to go to this place on a Monday; oops, not open. After 10 months of living in the Madison area, we have found THE RIB PLACE. The ribs are great, so is the brisket, the corn, beans...you get the idea. The restaurant is a little small but the service was amazing. Watching my family eat was almost as good as the food, almost. I highly recommend Smoky Jon's #1 BBQ."
1,"Tried to use a BOGO coupon and they ""didn't know how to do it""........ Manager couldn't help either. The girls working there are less than stellar to be there and it shows. I think I have yet to find a decent sally's beauty in phoenix."
5,Great lunch. In and out fast and even ice cream included.
1,So this kid named Brendan I think that was his name anyway he treated me extremely rude and like a common criminal....... being that he was wearing two obscene diamond earrings and wearing a gun on his hip he was obviously compensating for the little man's disease so I should empathetic but whatever he's a complete ass....... He's not Noah that's for sure ( his predecessor I assume)....... As I've said before about other places your money is better spent elsewhere Til next time
5,"OK - Let's be reasonable! 
5 stars is an incredible score, but here is why I gave it.
This diner is a hidden gem. 
I mean hidden, the only reason I went was because someone told me about it. It is located in the Wisconsin Aviation building off of Stoughton Road at the end of Amelia Earhart Dr.
There are no signs outside for this restaurant.
Once inside, it is clean, tastefully decorated, awesome view of the airport, attentive service and finally awesome food. - that's 5 reasons for 5 stars.
I had crab cakes Benedict. Oh yea! That is as good as it sounds baby.
Then I upgraded my hash browns with cheese, onions, and peppers. Well worth the up charge.
It will be hard for me to pick something different from their menu when I go back, AND I WILL BE GOING BACK."
1,"Bed bugs! 2 of us in 2 different rooms, both fairly badly bitten. Property were actually combative, denied they had a problem, accused us both of lying and apart from offering to do our laundry (with a number of caveats attached) did nothing. Miserable customer service from a battered, tired, dirty & old facility."
1,"Wife took our vehicle in today for a wash - said she was thinking of skipping it because it looked like rain.  Hindsight that was a BIG mistake.  Arrived evening - just after 5pm.  Paid for wash that was adequate at best.  They had the drivers door open on the vehicle when she walked out - pretty normal protocol.  She got in and drove home - only to realize the interior driver's side door latch was broken.  She had to power the window down to reach and release the exterior door.  I was jammed up so she drove straight back.  Spoke to manager - Martin Mejia.  He claimed the vehicle was like that when she arrived, which begs the response she provided 'your employees saw me get out of the vehicle - i would have had to roll the window down to do that'.  He was NOT interested in taking any responsibility and said they had looked all over for her - it was 5:20 and my wife and daughter were inside the waiting area and there was only ONE other customer in the building.  None of what he said was true and when my wife looked at the cashier - who had started to speak up - the manager stared her down.  My wife said 'are you going to coax her into lying now because she knows no one came to find us as you are saying'?  Here's the reality - and yeah i watched Columbo as a kid - was after hours, the cleaning guys on the cars were rockin and rollin, blowing over the windows with big damp rags, one of the rags wrapped around the interior plastic door trigger, and some tugged hard.  End of Story.  Now i get to see if there is any integrity in the corporate office.  I'm not optimistic."
1,"This review is for Easytech that's inside Staples. 
Dropped off my laptop to be diagnosed since it I was getting blue screen and error message related to the operating system. Informed technician that was getting OS message and tested computer. Came back after three alleged tests that said it was the DEFINITELY the motherboard. You know, in that know it all kinda way...

Asked 2nd in house technician to test it again and once again came back and said it was motherboard. Offered to send it off to be refurbished for $369.99 and told me that they would do everything that was needed. 

Called me back 2nd day to let me know that they couldn't refub. DEll XPS laptops with video cards and to get someone to replace the MB.  You'd thing that's something they would know. Ordered MB and had it installed by another technician  and it turned out to be the operating system.  Emailed technician regarding the inaccurate diagnosis and never received a reply. Morons. 

Certainly wouldn't assume just because they are working on computers that they know what they are talking about. 

Got me."
1,"The most amazingly bad service I've ever received. Drinks are good enough, but getting one in an hour is ridiculous....

The staff seemed very friendly, but it's hard to make up for the lack of competence Sr. Management or ownership shows to their industry. This is certainly a one and out for our group."
1,Don't go out of your way to get there because they probably won't be open. They were closed early the last two times I went there.
1,Most inefficient place I've been at.  Told it would be 30min and turned out to be an hour.  All I needed to do was replace a carrier clip.  Everyone was pissed off in the store.  You can't get simple service without waiting.  The only positive was the guy who checked us in finally got a clue and got me a new clip before my name was called.  The want personalized service but there only getting pissed off customers once they start to help them out.  Oh yea employees there park in the prime parking in front of the store.  I noticed this while we were waiting.   If you have a lot of spare time on your hands then this is the place for u. I will never go back to this store.
1,I asked the waiter what was gluten free on the menu and he didn't know. He asked the manager and still came back with a weird understanding of what I could order. It's strange that a huge chain like this would not have a gluten free menu or know what on their menu was ok to eat. It's the only restaurant that hasn't been accommodating to my gf lifestyle.
1,"Don't waste your money here. They love to find any reason to charge you extra fees. The front office is rude and doesn't ever return your phone calls or do what you ask them to do. They turn off the heat during summer months and turn off the AC in October even though its still in the 100s out. They had NO heat or AC almost the entire month of November and we still had to pay full rent. That is ILLEGAL. It was 105 and I had no AC, then it got down to 40 degrees at night and there was no heat so I had to keep my oven on to stay warm. I complained to the office and they just made up excuses to why they couldnt turn it on for a month. I was constantly having problems with losing hot water and water pressure. Ive had to call security there because neighbors were outside night after night fighting and hitting each ither and seciurity refused to come because they ""dont deal with violence"". are you kidding me?? whats the point of security?  I've never had such aggravations living at a place. I will never ever recommend this place to anyone. Worst experience ever."
5,"Someone that understands business. I just went in to get a new battery. I didn't have any cash on me so he told me to come back whenever and pay him. I don't often go to watch repair shops, but if I ever need to or someone asks I will certainly send my business to DeChance. I will also be going back tomorrow to pay him."
5,"Cute place, very laid back experience, friendly people! Not to mention my girlfriend's hair looks great! :)"
1,"I don't want to shop for sex toys in A. lights so bright that it makes everything and everyone washed out and pasty, B. a place where the quality of the products is questionable at best, C. where inevitably, a creep will follow me and my girlfriend around, trying to see what we're looking at.
Why does Phoenix not have better sex toy stores??"
1,"DO NOT go to the KFC on 7th ave and Thomas, we didnt learn the first time when they gave us the wrong order, but this time we went again since we were between classes at PC, we ordered our food and Alexander took our order, the chubby hispanic woman was getting it together and was busy talking loud and talking to her co workers, we got our order and decided to eat there, our order was wrong and Alexander tells her hey you got the order wrong, she starts YELLING saying no I didnt you did, we said look on our reciept he got it right, he shows her the screen and says see, then she YELLS well it says 2 3 piece dinner and he goes yeah but it says original and the other grilled, then she YELLS again and says its not my fault HUMMM if you got the wrong order since you were busy talking and not paying attention it IS YOUR FAULT, he says sorry, and she gets our order, we started eating and not even 2 mins go by when someone goes up and says my order is wrong SHE DID IT AGAIN and Alexander tells her hey you got another order wrong and she goes back into her mumbling , the food is good if they get your order right"
5,"Beautiful, thoughtfully arranged and free--can't get any better than this. 

Favorites: Thai Pavilion, Conservatory (smells wonderful), and it being free admission (did I say that already?)"
1,"$7 per slice for a Cheesecake? Okay that's understandable for being at the most expensive commercial real estate on 24st & Camelback in Phoenix. 

What is not excusable is the Moroccan Chicken. The only reason I got in my car a blew $30 on a meal on take out, is because of a video showing how delicious it was. What I got from this location was nothing short of horrible. It looked nothing like what I saw in the video, and on top of that the chicken was so dry I had to chase it down with water just to swallow it. It did not matter that they were generous, giving 3 breasts with the meal, because I could not finish even one. Since I hate wasting food I gave it to my 3 cats, but they would not even eat it, and they love chicken!

I would not have even written this review because I hate bashing businesses, but this place refused to answer my email complaint about the bad meal. At least answer and acknowledge you read it. Next time I'll just go down the road to Chili's. At least they try.."
5,"Fabulous exhibit in a beautiful building at a museum that is a non-profit organization adding so much to our downtown Phoenix!!!  What more can I say....I went to the BodyWorld exhibit early one morning during the week because I heard they can have a long line.  No line and it wasn't overly crowded.  (They only allow so many people in at once.)

I found the exhibit a true art form.  I watched the 5 minute video of how they preserve the bodies and what goes into the poses and am amazed.  I think the audio is a must for $5 more.   I learned a lot and would go back. Oh, that's right.... I am...for the Annual Yelp Party!

I have to say if I had children I would definitely take them to expose them to this amazing insight to our bodies.  A young Mom was there with a 4 year old & was explaining to her daughter what she was seeing, I have great admiration for parents that expose our youth to the arts and sciences, you go MOM!"
5,"I went here yesterday which was fantastic! These markets are huge and the inside is ridiculously fun! 
So I am just going to do a recap on my experience.
*Great prices on authentic products, the cheese counter was insane as was the meat counter!
*The agua counter was really fun and I did love the horchata!
*The area to eat lunch was fun I enjoyed my street tacos and the al pastor tacos were amazing! Yummy plus very inexpensive seriously!
*The bakery well lets just say I just kept staring at it wishing I could have it but I splurged on the tacos and horchata! Though my daughter loved it! :)
*Hehehe I saw a cow's head and it was amazing---kind of creepy but let me just say I want to try cabeza now!
*Jewelry!

Oh gosh there is everything this is a fun place to go especially if you are wanting to try to find some key ingredients to create a great authentic Mexican meal!  Will definitely go again next time I need to take my fiance and son so they can experience it as well!

Definitely a must go in Phoenix it is unique and very large."
5,"Don't let the rough exterior fool you, but this place is great! John and his crew were very honest and personable. Would recommend without hesitation!"
1,"This Michaels is the foundation of my theory that some chains stay in business despite the reality that shoppers loathe them, because there's no adequate substitute. It's the only source of craft supplies that's handy while running errands in central Phoenix, and it's near one of the movie theaters that serves real food, so I shop here occasionally, and I always leave crabby.

Every section is tiny and understocked. If something at another Michaels catches your eye, but you postpone buying it, and you figure, oh, you'll pick it up at this one because you're here... no, you won't. Wood trim, wood embellishments, specific acrylic paint colors, specific scrapbook paper designs, the edgiest floral items... forget it. This Michaels will not carry that. The staff will explain, with varying levels of chagrin, that ""this is the smallest Michaels in the region.""

That much is obvious. It's so small that it's impossible for two carts to pass in most aisles. 

The major reason to set foot in this store is that you're desperate for tacky glue and can't face the chaos of Walmart. It has so far not found an excuse to stop carrying tacky glue. 

There was also a moment of hope when the chain introduced Martha Stewart acrylic paints, which are at least interesting colors. But I'd really like to know whose bright idea it was that, chain-wide, acrylic paints should now be displayed entirely below knee level. Let me give you a hint, gentlemen: the tiny bottles of exotic colors are not bought by children. Nor is there a gigantic acrylic-painting movement among Munchkins. Your acrylic paint buyers are adults, which means we're mostly over 5 feet tall, and depending how the day went and how high of heels we're wearing, our urge to indulge in a series of deep knee bends can vary. A lot. But it's rarely a matter of: ""oh great! I'm going to Michaels so I can skip the squats at the gym!"""
5,"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in all of Phoenix.  I'm never dissappointed with their food regardless of what I order.  It's inexpensive, clean, bright, and delicious.  

It's a restaurant, market and bakery all in one building with a large seating area to enjoy the food on location.  You can buy a beer at the market and drink it along with the food you order which is cool.  And the salsa bar has shades of heat to please everyone.  

The chile rellenos are awesome and I often ordered them when I was a vegetarian.  But, if you're the type who won't eat beans with lard or rice with chicken stock, then you won't be happy here.  Now that I gave up the vegetarianism, I am thoroughly happy with the variety of flavors in the meat items.  The meat is always moist and flavorful."
1,"We were in the mood for wings and their half price reverse happy hour. Everyone was nice, the food was good, we shared the regular boneless wings, barbecue boneless wings, and mozzarella sticks. 

However.

About a half hour, maybe an hour at most, both of us were horribly sick. All last night, and now today too. My girlfriend had to leave work she's so sick (I told her not to go into work with food poisoning...) It was probably the chicken wings. At least its friday now so we can be sick at home and not worry about working."
5,"Sports Illustrated rated this place as one of the twenty best sports bars in the country.  While that's probably a stretch, the food and grog here are very good, and there is always a TV nearby featuring sports.

I'd be torn between 4 and 5 stars for Majerle's, but one time I was here eating a salad at the bar and Thunder Dan himself came up and asked how I was enjoying everything.  Very outgoing and friendly guy, so let's give him 5 stars."
1,Have been for lunch during the week several times and it was worth putting up with the consistently rude and horrible service for the quick and good and cheap food.     Went today for early Sunday dinner and will not go back.   Service was beyond horrible and food just OK at best.   Also too expensive for what you get.    I don't need to spend thirty dollars to be treated.rude.
1,"The carpet is completely unsanitary and a breeding ground for MRSA. The instructor only verbally ran the class, never demonstrated one pose OR even made rounds to correct those doing them wrong. Lots of people that hadn't done yoga before because of the groupon and it's unfortunate they have been thought incorrectly. This instruction method is going to cause people injuries. FYI never do a jerking twisting motion with your upper body to try and square your hips!!! The instructor even told me and another girl NOT to drink water at the moment we did! So not OK, always listen to your bodies needs."
1,"This is one of those places you want to give negative stars to--that's really all you need to glean from this review. 

Are you a lady who hasn't had her fill of being talked down to or hit on by sleazy dudes today? Do you need an oil change but really can't be bothered to find out how much it will cost? Do you like overpaying for a carwash whose end result you could have paid $3 at Clean Freak to achieve? Well, sounds like you want to go to visit the total clowns at Danny's. 

I went here once about a year ago for an oil change and car wash. It took over an hour and I was really annoyed by the clumsy, gross flirting from the guy and that he forgot to give me the free car wash that came with it and how long it took them to give it to me when I pointed out that I was owed one. Don't make my mistake and go back because they happened to by close to your work and open when all other options were closed and you really need an oil change. 

First, I pulled up and waited five minutes for someone to make eye contact so I can figure out what bay to pull up to for an oil change. Seriously, if I'm not supposed to pull up to where the signs say OIL CHANGE to get one then get a sign to tell me where else to go to arrange this. Finally, I'm approached by some guy who stared at my cleavage the whole time he gave me the runaround of what costs what. Oh, you want me to pay $10 so that you CHECK--not act upon--the fluid levels in my car and check the tire pressure? Is this ridiculous upcharge only for ladies who you assume to be total dummies or are you an equal opportunity rip-off artist? 

After about five minutes of conversation, I still have no idea what an oil change costs there, only what extra fees they'd like to charge me for stuff that should be free and I'm pretty sure the employee doesn't either because he wants to be paid under the table. He told me he'd do a full service oil change if I just left $20 in the car. Like, don't exchange money with him out in the open, but leave it in the car, like he's an oil change hooker and I'm the john. I'm assuming your employer isn't keen on you not paying taxes, dude, but thanks for the offer?

I never followed up with these guys to figure out why the employee would tell me that it's $31.95 if I pay inside and $20 if I pay him by just leaving money in the car because I'd rather just stay away from these guys. I got in the car and closed the door on the employee while he was still trying to give me the hard sell because he wouldn't take no for an answer, which is every woman's dream, isn't it?

Oh, and the car wash I got last year with the oil change sucked, too. There's nothing to make a girl feel more self conscious about her reliable yet boring Toyota like watching her car get ignored and left with water spots drying on it while all the guys working gather around to take pictures of themselves cleaning a Lamborghini."
5,I shopped in the downtown store last July and found that the lady that worked there had a lot of hisotical knowlege to share.  I loved the shop and the fact that I learned a little about the area.  She didn't have the item in the color I wanted so she directed me to the Gainey Ranch location and they had it.  That is also a lovely shop and the owners were there.  They were also happy to share some history with us which was great.  Both shops are a great place to visit when visiting the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.
5,"Great meat counter for Beef, Pork and deli meats. solid produce, bulk nuts and dried fruits, and spices sections for a corner store. support this place. The've been open for 25+ years supporting local farmers and the community."
1,"This review is just about the paint department, only.  The workers in that department there are phenomenal but the lack of staffing in the paint department is ridiculous.  You can count on them to do their best,  but it is hard to deal with.  I used to be in there a lot.  All of the workers bust their guts trying to get the orders out and correct.  They are exceptionally helpful and try their best.  Apparently, the management (or corporate) doesn't care, or doesn't want to retrain and hire more workers to cover the paint department, or doesn't want to pay, or doesn't care if they have workers comp claims or whatever.  That is a tough department with high volume.  If you go for paint, try for Friday nights or some other off time, due to the backlog.  Whenever possible,  I have moved my purchases over to another specialty paint store only due to the lack of staffing at Home Depot on Thomas Road."
5,"great donuts. great gyros.
and the most adorable owners ever.
just make sure you aren't in any rush, if you think about ordering food here. still worth visiting."
5,"Doughnuts are bomb. 
Coffee is weak, so deal with it and get a large.  
Next to the doughnuts are instant rame cups and assorted treats that somehow someone must buy.
While having coffee a street character rolled up on a bike and had some serious street survival gear, backpack loaded and 3 shopping bags with extra clothes in them attached around his waist to his belt. And HE bought 2 old fashions. 
The workers sound like ""Tammy"" from the nail salon comedy bit. 
They sell Oreo cookies by the roll they just took out of the box, no packaged for re-sale here. 
Ok now Tammy is speaking good broken Spanish. 
Man I Iike it here, you won't get that ""mas puto!"" vibe you get at Starbucks or Fair Trade when your lady drags you into places like that."
1,"New location needs better ventilation. Awkward layout reeks of musty clothes.  Odor persists into breezeway. 

Organization not clear. I sincerely hope this is a temporary location."
1,Arrived there at 3:48PM today.  Had the VIP done with some detailing and was told it should take around 45 minutes.  Left there at 5:52PM.  They did a good job with the actual cleaning of the vehicle but being grossly mislead on the turn around time was inexcusable and enough to prevent me from coming back or recommending the company to anyone.
1,"I generally like Best Buy and have always had very good luck with them.  I recently moved just a few blocks away from the 20th St and Camelback store -- This has got to be the nastiest and most disorganized Best Buy I have ever been to. 

Last week I was there to purchase a tv bracket -- 70% of the items were out of stock.  The next day I went to purchase a simple cable for my phone -- out of stock.  Last night I went to return an item -- no one was in line, however it took close to 20 minutes for someone to come to the customer service desk.  Once she was there, she didn't know how to use the register, then register ran out of paper once she was ready to process my return and took another 10 minutes for her to find a manger to change the receipt paper.  Employees are rude and mostly brain dead at this store.  I'd rather drive 20-30 minutes to Fry's Electronics in Tempe than ever return to this store again. The manager of this store needs to be fired."
5,"This place is yummy, cute and very comfortable...been on a date, with parents, with my friends and for special events.  You can't go wrong here - and I don't want it to be overlooked!  Go try it!"
5,I recently spoke with the manager regarding extended stays at this location and he provided a tour of the facilities and a couple rooms. I'm extremely impressed with the service and facilities and plan to go here for future visits while in the Madison area.
5,This is a great place to eat authentic Mexican food! Your server always bring out chips and salsa first thing while you look over the menu (salsa is spicy and really good).  The dinner combos are very reasonable and you get a good portion size.  My boyfriend and I usually go once a week to eat here.
1,"What happened to this place? I used to go here quite often, but I am thinking twice before returning. I waited to update this review until I had 3 negative experiences because I wanted to give Zoe's the benefit of the doubt, but things have not improved. First off, there has been water covering the floor of the left side of the restaurant the past 3 times I have been there. I think they have a leaky roof, but it has been weeks, maybe even months, and there is still water. This is hazardous and just plain disgusting. Also, the restaurant is just dirty. I had to ask to have 2 different tables wiped down, and the crumbs from the table were wiped onto the chairs. There were 5 of us in for lunch last week, and every chair was covered in crumbs from the previous diners. So gross! I am sad this place has gone downhill; Zoe's has always been a staple for my friends and me, and now we will have to find a replacement."
5,"I went here yesterday for the first time and was very pleasantly surprised! They have a huge selection of shellac colors and she did a very careful and thorough job painting my nails. The girls were very sweet and pampering, and I even got paraffin included with my mani! I'll be back very soon for a pedicure. I saw someone getting one there yesterday and it looks like they spend lots of time on the massage."
5,"I have not Yelped in quite a while and to all my fans (all none of you)...sorry.  So I will start on a positive note...

So I have been to the Beach House so many times I feel dumb reviewing it but I am so deal with it and go there.

If you are going for drinks...do it.  The clientele is awesome and you will always hear some great stories.  But this review is for the food.  ALWAYS AMAZING!  We went for breakfast the other day for the first time in a long time and it was as good as I remember.  The Eggs Benedict are just delicious and something I could eat every day and they make one hell of a Bloody Mary (so I am told by my wife since I do not like them) if your interest in that.

So if you want some good breakfast on the weekend and in the McFarland area...Breach House it is!"
1,"John S, I appreciate your interest in making people think T Cooks is a great place, and I also appreciate your attempt to get me back in to waste money.  However, I just explained that your waiter was trying to run up the bill and your food was salty.  And your response was ""sorry...hope you come back."". Well sorry John S, not good enough. I am actively encouraging others to avoid your restaurant.  At your prices, you should know better."
1,"hey fate.  you were better when you were that hole in the wall on university called lucky dragon.


boo.

nastiest food ever."
1,I should have read all the reviews before sitting down to eat.  Well it was 5:30pm on a Sat night so you would assume that everything would be fresh.    Shame on me for assuming things.   The soups were horrible and looked they had being sitting there all week.  The pizza wasn't even pizza but crust with sauce on it.   The iceberg lettuce was a mixture of lettuce with chunks not even cut up yet.  I love Souplantation/ Sweet Tomatoes and I have high standards for anyone else tryiing to be a Salad Buffet.      I would have given this place a half a star but the manager was nice enough to refund my money so it gets one star.
1,"I write this as I sit awaiting for my food.  I've been waiting for an hour now.  At a table with 10 other people, and the food is brought out 1 or 2 at a time.  This will be my last visit."
5,"It's 2012, and for the third year in a row, I saw Duane and his staff, and what can I say?  The service was absolutely superb.  

If you're looking for qualified people to prepare your tax returns, look no further.  They are extremely friendly - Duane gave me a warm and friendly greeting when I saw him in the hall, even though he was on the phone.  They are precise with their preparation, and the fees are BEYOND reasonable - I literally pay 1/3 of what I used to pay to the ""big green-box tax company.""

Don't bother with DIY tax return software; go see Duane and his group.  You'll enjoy your time with them, and they'll take great care of you.  I was reminded that they provide year-round service; if I receive any communications from the State or IRS, I'm told Duane and his crew will be there to help.  I used to pay extra for that service with the othHeR guys.

So.. I know I'm gushing, but I really do appreciate Duane and his company.  I'm certain I'll visit them again next year - you should visit them this year.

Go.  Go now."
5,"I have always been a home depot fan, myself, but have recently started to visit Menards more frequently in recent months per request of my handy-man boyfriend. They have always had the products we are in search of and often have great sales that I have taken advantage of from time to time. Recently we went shopping for a project and I picked up a poinsettia for the holidays. When we were checking out the woman at the register asked if I have a cat (I do!) and let me know that poinsettias are very poisonous to cats if they eat them and she would have for my cat to get sick..or worse..because of my holiday decorating. I couldn't be more appreciative! She truly went above and beyond the assistance I usually find at hardware/home improvement stores. Thank you, Thank you!"
5,"They do a fantastic job here- fast, efficient and inexpensive. My car is always sparkling. They sell booklets of basic washes plus some extra (rain-x, under flush, matt cleaning, etc) that my dad always gets my brother, me, and our significant others for Christmas- it's really useful for getting the salt off in the winter"
5,"Don't be fooled into thinking the Arizona Science Center is just for kids. I've been both with my nephew and with fellow ""big kids"" aka adults. Every time I go, I have a blast and it's not necessary to borrow your friend's child in order to find an excuse to go. The Science Center is equivalent to some of finest science centers across the nation with their state of the art technology, interactive exhibits and activities for all ages. 

During past visits, I've enjoyed traveling exhibits like the Titanic exhibit years ago. As you entered, they gave you a piece of paper with a name on it. As you walked through the exhibit you looked for the name and learned about who the person was. Then at the very end, there was a wall full of names and you got to see if the name they gave you survived or not. Even though I was a history major in college, I learned several new facts in this exhibit and it was extremely interactive and educational with fun mixed in! 

Currently, they have an exhibit called ""Forces of Nature"" where you can learn about different weather patterns, climates and how weather happens. In the middle of the exhibit you can walk up onto a stage-like area where you experience different weather patterns interactively. I won't give it away, but you could get stuck in some rainy weather! 

Just recently, I was giving a super secret sneak peak into the brand new exhibit launching on 9/27 called ""All About Me."" They've been working on this exhibit for at least a year if not longer and it certainly shows! The amount of thought and energy they put into each exhibit is incredible and it's an extremely dynamic experience. Throughout the exhibit, I ""x-rayed"" a body and learned about different body parts, I entered a stomach and discovered the ins and outs of the digestive system (no pun intended) and there was even an intestine slide to take a ride down. I placed my hands hands on a censored area and a drum beat to the rate of my heart! Needless to say, the exhibit excited me and while I definitely am still a kid at heart, it was the adult in me who couldn't wait to come back and explore some more. 

Before I go, I want to share some other favorites that the Science Center offers...the Imax and Adults Night Out! They have a state of the art, full size Imax theater on site and they show movies like Under the Sea. I am a big fan of the Imax and have been swept away into different worlds many times here. Adults Night Out is just that, where you can explore the exhibits, attend an Imax show and have a fun night out sans any children! I also heard a rumor that they might be bringing alcohol back during these nights! Let's wait and see. :)"
5,"Can't say enough wonderful things about
This place The owner Salem is a gentlemen 
And a half  Mark and Zack are great Guys too ... It's my go to place in the neighborhood for everything !!!!!!!"
5,"I've long been searching for the best camarones diabla and have found that gem here in their camarones endiablados offering. This spicy seafood dish hit all the right notes!  

My husband also loved their cheese crisp and cheese enchiladas. 

I've not been to Mexico but I would bet this is real deal Mexican cuisine."
1,"The single most disgusting sushi experience I've ever had. Asian nachos were burned and tasteless, April and Toosties rolls were totally bland and the texture was way off, the crab wontons came with some funky nasty sauce.. Blahhhh. $50 down the toilet."
1,"Lame, I didnt have very high expectations but had heard a very good things and I was not impressed.  The bartender told me everything was fresh and prepared in house and made to order.  After I ordered the food came out literally within 1-3 mins so I know for a fact that it was not fresh or made to order.  To be honest I would have been more satisfied with food court chinese/asian food.  Sad comparison i know, but true. I would not eat there again."
5,"I've always loved this theater. Big enough and still be intimate. There are no bad seats on the main floor. I love the feeling of grandeur once you enter this theater. I always feel like whatever I'm watching is going to be good otherwise it wouldn't be performing at the Herberger. I also love their location, 5 min walking distance from the Arizona Center so we can have a great dinner before a show at a nice restaurant without having to stress out about driving and the need to find parking twice!"
5,"Told them to replace my belt tensioner due to frequent squeaking after replacing my belt.. They looked around and said ,""nope, take the belt back and ask for a new one under warranty"".. Charged be $12, and after installing a new belt, turns out they were right. Honest guys."
5,"This place is legit. They practically spit shined my car for under 20 bucks. Get the basic wash and you won't be disappointed. They clean it inside and out. 

also if you check in on yelp, you get 2 bucks off. You're welcome."
1,They like to nickel and dime you with everything. You bring your cat/dog in for a check up and later you get a call for something else that is wrong with them or they need some sort of medication. Also they only have women as vets which is kind of strange
5,"This ""bar"" is a model of simplicity. A converted old house that serves more as a halfway house to Pizzeria Bianco, where patrons sip on beer and wine while waiting for a table at the heavenly pizza joint. There is plenty of charm in the setting and service only builds upon that foundation. The wodden porch offers a wonderful perch to people watch or gather around with friends. Each time I have been to Pizzeria Bianco, I have been with a large group - thus making a visit to Bar Bianco a perfect place to pass the wait for a table. And each of those occasions has been a lovely experience, where the wait flew on by. BB features great wine supported by even better atmosphere and service!"
1,"This has always been one of our go too restaurants.  On our last visit as we were enjoying the last bit of a bottle of wine.  Servers picked up 1/2 full water glasses, and swarmed our table, they wanted us out.  we were a party of 4 had enjoyed our dinner and we were just finishing up.  This was just flat out rude and very disappointing.  Since when should you feel rushed to finish your bottle of wine.  Not sure we will go back.  I expect great service.  There are plenty of great restaurants here in Scottsdale."
5,"Best BBQ in Madison! Ribs are amazing, and the fried sweet rolls melt in your mouth. They basically the best beignets I have ever had. I stop here almost every time on my way to the airport."
5,"There aren't enough words!  Alice's restaurant is THE place to go in Phoenix!  Outstanding food, friendly and helpful wait staff....super décor, decent prices...and it's a wonderful place for kids too.  Not too many of those.  Cooperstown has seen us before and will see us again and again."
5,This place is amazing and the service they provide is top notch. Staff is very sweet and the 3D pictures you get of your baby are amazing. The price is very affordable and if your thinking about going..... Do it!
5,"Great service, great food!  One dish was too spicy. They immediately took it back and fixed it. The Tom Ga Kai was very good. They have this rated with '$$' but the quality exceeded the price!"
5,"I just flew into Phoenix for a night to catch Game 4 of the WNBA Finals. 
The venue is great to catch a ballgame.  It's clean, people are friendly and every section has a great view of the court.

I really do enjoy traveling to Phoenix to catch a game.  This is truly a great place to enjoy it all (and it gets you out of the heat).  My partner went to buy a beer and came back with the hugest mug ever! 

No really, I've been to many arenas and this is the most fan friendly place.  You can take a picture next to the life-sized Steve Nash or Diana Taurasi.  The employees are all super friendly and seem to happy working the events.

If you haven't checked out this arena, it's a must!  Every seat makes you feel like you are sitting court-side with the best of the best!"
1,"Trendy spot?  Maybe, if it was 1982.  This place is in need of a serious update, but it looks like most of the customers need one too.  How does it survive in this competitive town?  

I expect it to be shut down when I come back to town.  Good spot for something new."
1,"Best Buy is a necessary evil because I don't know where else to get/do the things they have/can do for me.  But if anyone does know a good local electronics place, let me know.  ASAP.

I took my computer to Best Buy to get it recycled.  Computer parts are super toxic and should NOT be thrown into the trash.  They wanted to charge me $10 to recycle it.  Someone step out there and pass a dammed law saying that recycling charges must be included in purchases, for the love of god.  It doesn't take a genius to determine cause-and-effect incentive structures and figure this out.  Oh, tangent.

But I didn't have to pay $10, because they were going to charge me $20 to remove my harddrive, and that apparently trumps the recycling charge.  $20.  TWENTY.  It's 4 screws.  That's it.  That's $5 per screw.  I asked him if i could just borrow a screwdriver and I'd do it right there.  He said no.  So I went to try and find a screwdriver for purchase in the store.  The only one came in a $30 computer toolkit set.  Defeated, i retreated back to the Thief Squad and paid them $5 per screw, which took them all of 40 seconds, and left harddrive in hand and $20 lighter.

Best Buy, I hate you."
5,"Buck's is my favorite pizza.  Ever.  Fortunately, we live a block away and can walk down whenever we want, which is often.  This is thin crust, no-frills pizza.  It is sold out of what used to be a car wash, next to a VFW that has Happy Hour from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (support our troops!).  There is no seating; pizza is take out only.  They even sell cans of pop!  I love cans of pop, because I drink soda about once every two months and don't need a bucket of it.  Sometimes when I drive by, I think Buck's has gone out of business.  But then I call and they answer, and everything is okay.  Buck's is perfect for a night in.  Order it if you don't want to fill up on bready crust.  My boyfriend and I split a large pizza (no, we aren't obese), so order a few if you are dining with friends.  They don't have extras like bread sticks, etc, but they will make you a pizza without sauce, which I call cheese bread and dip in sauce."
1,"I went into the Scottsdale location yesterday.  I was going to be seated right by the kitchen by the host when the restaurant was 20% full and then asked to be seated in another area where there were more people around and better lighting.  The waiter never cleared our plates, and I had to order 3 meals before I could even eat anything.  This restaurant had dirty menus dirty plates/glasses, slow waiters, the food was unedible and the kitchen was slow...  I think this time I am calling the food inspector.  I am sure that there are many violations happening in this restaurant.  I tried to give them feedback, however, they  did not recieve it well.

Please don't waste your money.  This is such a poor example of no service and bad food.  I expected to get food poisoning after this experience."
5,"This was a fresh take and a nice change from the ""normal"" fast lunches I am used to. One my first visit I asked the lady helping me what she recommended. She said the steak kabobs are excellent and so are the chicken. My partner and I got one of each, lets just say this has become a regular stop for us. Food was fresh and tasty and the staff have always been very pleasant."
5,"Seriously good coffee.  I'm not really a coffee drinker, but even I can tell the difference between Johnson Bros. and whatever starbucks crap I usually drink."
1,"DOUBLE-X BLACKLIST. Three years since my last visit (not long enough apparently), and it's time I updated and upgraded Macayo's to DOUBLE-X. See you in 2014 beeyotches.

Where oh where have your owners gone, Macayo's? What happened to the quality of food with which you opened and on which your franchise and brand name are founded?

FIRE your kitchen staff, FIRE your kitchen manager, and FIRE your general manager.

Mediocre, bland, sometimes scary, late, cold, not clean, goopy, old and stale.

--cardboard menu cards are wet and starting to mildew from days and days of moisture;
--salsa 4 to 5 days old. the salt has made it briney, the green chilis are fermenting it into vinegar;
--special ""top shelf"" fresh-fruit texas margarita is a swirl of gatorade-colored syrup and a complete waste of grand marnier; head to Quick Trip instead;
--rice from weeks ago, reheated, refrigerated, reheated, refrigerated, microwaved and then served from oblivion; dry, cakey gloopy SHIT. Shame on you!;
--refried beans go the same way. ranch style. they keep for weeks out on the ranch. didn't finish them? no problem. just throw in a bit of lard and put 'em back on the fire. Macayo's clearly has the technique mastered.
--chicken ""guisado"" so old, even cooks from Diamonds wouldn't serve it;
--flour tortillas either not fully cooked, or kept in the same damp room as the menu cards -- they were doughy and starting to ferment;
--sopapillas for shame! looked like fried cowpies. you couldn't force feed me this shit! SEND IT BACK!!!

After dining at the mother restaurant, you can be sure I'll think twice when I see the Macayo bird on something at the grocery. BLECH."
1,"The prices are outrageous.  I went in to mail an 5x8"" envelope with a few CDs in it.  They told me it would be $16.95.  I went to the post office:  $4.95.  

Don't bother unless you like shelling out a few extra bones."
1,"This place is Disgusting!!! Rice is Overcooked, tasted like a baby food 
My California Rolls did not even looked like ones. Lunch menu was way too small for the price. 
All-You-Can eat was a disaster. It took them 45 min to bring second order of rolls which we could not even eat, because they had NO Taste !!! Service is way too slow as well their chefs which I think would make a much better job cooking Salsa. 
Save your time and money and try to stay away from that Sushi JOKE Place!!!"
1,"Are you kidding me with this office staff? The Tempe office wait is NEVER less than 45 minutes. Why have an appointment if it's an hour or more that you sit in the waiting room.
Today, I left after waiting one hour and 15 minutes. RIDICULOUS! Can I bill them for wasting my time?
Dr Carter performed knee surgery. He's a great doctor, but it's not worth putting up with the office staff to see him.
Also, good luck having them fill out leave paperwork for your job in a complete, correct, and timely manner. Because of their errors, my paycheck was held up for a month! AND you get to pay the office $25 each time they fill out paperwork. 

I've been to 3 other orthopedic surgeons over the years in the valley and none with as poorly managed office as this. Do yourself a favor and find a smaller office where you'll be treated like a person rather than a number."
1,"I used this place once, and it will be my last. The place reeked of old urine. I'm not sure if someone has used it as a bathroom, and the place never got cleaned, or what? All I know is that it stinks, and not a good smell at that."
5,"Came in for brunch today and had a very nice experience.  I really like their décor, classic diner style.  I got the Meatloaf and oh my goodness it was so AMAZING! The homemade gravy was to die for!  My friend got the Egg Mornay I didn't try it but it looked delicious.  Our server Eric was also amazing! I will definitely be returning soon, for a first time experience I give five stars! 

As a side note as we were walking out every single employee that we passes said, ""Thank you, have a great day."""
5,"After finding this hotel during a crisis a few years ago, we've continued to make it our home away from home in Madison on several trips. I still can't believe that for $70 you can get such a great suite with a full breakfast."
1,"Really this place was gross.  They need to just scrub the place down.  It is filthy.  I was excited to find a cute little malt shop to take the kids to with a 5o's theme.  I had a Reuben.  The meat was tough, and could not be eaten.  My husband and son had a preformed patty for a burger.    My daughter  had a BLT.  Really?  How can you make a GROSS BLT!  It just made me sick that we spent $50 dollars on such a truly bad meal.  The malts were good.  It took us getting through 3/4 of our meal before they came though.  The wait staff was two college age girls that you could tell didn't give a rip if the customer was getting good service.  Go there for a malt or shake and call it good.  Everything else sucked."
1,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Baja Fresh is a poor man's chipotle, but that's an insult to poor men everywhere.

First off, I think everyone in Phoenix is missing the gene where they actually listen to directions.  When you order something, you shouldn't get ANOTHER.  Totally got that, it ruined the start of my vacation and it made me sick the entire time I was in Phoenix.  Ironically, I never stepped into a Baja before, but I learned my lesson to eat dirt rather than eat here.

I ordered a burrito bowl (I think it's called ""bare"" burrito), and I asked for whatever the hell it was, and you have to special order steak or chicken.  I said neither but Iwanted guac.  No problem they told me.  I hate chicken and I got it anyway.  I didn't know until I got back to my conference.  Note to self: they fuck you in the drive-thru.

Anyway, it wasn't even that GOOD.  And it made me sick.  Did I mention that?  I don't totally blame Baja though.  Chipotle did its part in pissing me off for the whole trip.  Baja unfortunately just fell out of my butt hours later."
1,"Just had the worst customer service from the management at the  Chilis on Camelback and 20th st. As a long time former employee of the company, I'm even more appalled! Sad day :("
5,"I'll write more later... at this moment, I just want to add that Paisley Violin also has FREE WIFI in addition to all the other wonderful things that other reviewers have said."
5,"I heard Maestro Falletta on a radio interview.  She was lucid and deft with her language.  Speaking extemporaneously.  I wondered if she was more truly a verbal maestro than a musical one.  She made me realize how good it is to live a life immersed in music, something redemptive.  Not clogged with bitterness or bottom lines.  Stress?  Sure.  But in the service of something eternal.  The music.  Which lasts when administrations and trends are gone, and flashes in the pan are revealed as pyrite.  Speaking of eternal, the particular piece she was discussing was Beethoven's fifth.  And I learned something!  Real pros don't call it Beethoven's fifth. They call it ""Beethoven Five"".  Can you imagine composing something that the best talents of subsequent ages compete with each other to try to do honor to? She also discussed the ruddy earthy tambre of another piece, and those words resonated because I was careening across a stretch of Arizona's ruddy desert at that point and I felt her words echo the landscape.  She was more lyrical and relevant and hard hitting with her prose than many self-styled prose gurus and 97% of talking heads.  As a Virginian, I was proud to learn that she is a director at the Virginia Symphony Orchestra, also.  Attaboy (or girl) JoAnn!"
5,"Amazing food, great presentation and sleek space - with NO WAIT on a Saturday night!  Huh?  Yes, you read that right.  After taking in the Body Worlds exhibit (What else does someone do after seeing dead bodies?  Have dinner of course!) at the AZ Science Center we headed to Pizzeria Bianco and decided that we really didn't want to wait 3.5 hours (Phoenix's equivalent of Bridge and Tunnel were at PB in full effect) for food, especially when there are so many great restaurants within 1 mile.  So off to Cheuvront it was, and what a great dinner it was.

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 4.75 stars
Service - 3.75 stars
Overall - 4.5 stars

This is my third visit over the past few years, and each time it has been on a weekend night with a surprisingly sparse crowd.  I'm not sure why this is.  I've never heard anything bad about this place, so I suspect AZ State Senator Cheuvront's restaurant must be suffering from light rail construction.  Their loss should be your gain, as diners are rewarded with light crowds and superb food and wine.  Even one of my dining guests visiting from New York City was impressed.

The sexy modern space on the first floor of the Artisan Lofts sets that perfect urban tone that the menu and locale indicate.  We sat at a table towards the back close to the loungey sofa area and curtained bar tables.  Cool touch.  We started out with a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc chilled in a fancy container and noshed on a French charcuterie plate of a pate mousse, cornichons (I have a weakness for salty gherkins), two cheeses, marinated artichokes, asparagus, kalamata olives, smooth spicy mustard and a crusty artisanal sourdough baguette.  What a great way to start a dinner, eh?

Our main entrees continued the pace and didn't disappoint.  I ordered the prosciutto wrapped grilled shrimp and macaroni and cheese.  Those thangs weren't shrimp.  These MOFOS were GIANT tiger prawns, and they were presented on a bed of mango avocado salsa drizzled with a balsamic reduction.  HEAVEN.  The macaroni was impressive as well - and cooked with three fancy cheeses: Quebec cheddar, comte and a dry jack cheese. 

Bonnie shared some of her ahi tuna salad nicoise - and that tuna was seared and seasoned perfectly, and surprisingly fresh.  Additionally I had a taste of the peppercorn filet and was pleased with the marinated tender taste of the meat.  

Price for 3 people (apps, entrees and $40 bottle of wine) - $115.  Average entree - $16.  Not bad, methinks.

My only complaint would be the service.  It was very good for the most part, but started to falter toward the end as our server's attentiveness (which was impressive most of the evening) left us with finished dinner plates on our table for about 15 minutes.  In his defense though, he gave us a very warm and classy (classy with a 'C') welcome and spoke very knowledgeably about the menu and wine when we had questions. Additionally, the hostess and other servers are super friendly and congenial. 

I'm eager for my next visit so I can try some of their martinis and buy cheeses from their retail section, but I would be just as happy enjoying a glass of wine there and soaking the place up."
1,"Went to wear the Free People gauze tiered top I had paid to have CLEANED, and there are STILL spots on the garment.  I had spilled a couple of drops of strawberry milkshake on the bodice and it evidently dripped to the lower tier, unbeknownst to me when I brought in the top to be CLEANED at Fashion Cleaners.  The spot I did point out on the bodice is gone, but Fashion Cleaners did not look for other spots, and three remain.  So I spent about $7.00 for a half-baked job.

Filed complaint with the Better Business Bureau and guess what?  They have ignored it.

The following transpired on 11/9/13, AFTER the BBB closed the complaint because the owner(s) had not responded:

Rec'd response re complaint and DANA still doesn't get it.  No remorse, no apology, no acceptance/admission of mistakes.  A grudging refund with a nasty reply.  Can you say ""pass the buck and blame everything on a customer""?  Fashion Cleaners CAN and DOES!   I sent these people about a dozen pictures of what I was talking about...feel,sorry for the co-owner, who doesn't seem half-bad, but when a person such as his partner presents the way she did with me, I just cannot, in good conscience, revise my rating."
5,"This place is so wonderful.  I purchased a thank you card for my sister, electrical plugs, Haagen Daz, and ground hamburger on my first trip.  

My son went back and purchased a freshly made pastrami sandwich from their little deli. 

Just moved down the street and this will be my go-to place from now on.  If Sunshine doesn't have it then I will go elsewhere."
5,"Great selection of birdseed, birdhouses, books, and other fun wildlife-related gifts. Yes, they may cost more than eBay, but you get great service from the staff who are helpful in answering questions. They are knowledgable and happy to help."
5,"I have been here a bunch of times, thanks to a coworker who recommended it for authentic, good Mexican.  I'm trying to think of everything I've tried here:  the Wednesday lunch special of chicken in a light mole sauce, chicken soup, cheese enchiladas, burrito all delicious.  The service is fast, the food is always good.  Highly recommend."
5,"Amazingly, every year I look forward to doing my taxes and it's all because I can leave everything in Duane's caring and capable hands. His rates beat the big folks and his staff are bi-lingual and extremely accommodating. Duane is smart, quirky, and trustworthy: exactly what I need."
1,Stopped by after I got a flat tire on my way home. Pro - they patched it and it was free. Con - they ruined my tire. I had to get a completely new tire a few days later.
5,Great mexican food and great salsa! They have an excellent breakfast burrito and lots of lunch specials. I love going here but the food is so intense i usually want a nap afterwards.
1,"The misses is a Trader Joe's nut so we're all up in Town & Country bizznaz weekly. So there we were Sunday night in great need of sustenance. We had a choice between the new Grassroots place & this one. I saw the sign out front for their special that night, a feta burger. The lady said fine with me, I've had their chicken souvlaki & it was good. Alas we have found refuge on this long day of errands & chores.

To take the edge off I ordered a sangria. It was fine. The prices were very affordable so I didn't expect anything heavenly. Just honest food for an honest price.

The food came & looked fine. I took a bite of the burger & it was very dry. I had a few fries which were good. After seeing the Misses dissect her chicken souvlaki & placing a piece of undercooked chicken on the spare plate between us I noticed something was just not right here. I opened the bun on my burger. What I saw was fresh lettuce, tomato & a mediocre bun...but it was the burger took me back in time to when I was in 3rd grade in the cafeteria sitting next to my buddy Jimmy. It was about half a centimeter thin & could potentially have many uses as a coaster, a mini Frisbee, an eye patch, heat shield tiles on the next shuttle to Mars, skeet shooting - altho I recommend a 12 gauge to take this thing down. 

The misses noticed the dazed look on my face and says, ""Honey?""

""Yeah Jimmy, what's up?"" I reply..

She gave me that look & I snapped back into reality but was still in disbelief at this burger patty. I ate 2 bites & left it dismantled. I finished my fries & her charred chicken. The raw portion of her chicken ruined it for her. She ate her rice & salad, which were good.

The server was very nice & I told her what I thought of the food. I think this was the first place I've ever complained about the food at a restaurant, I just never go back. This meal was.....just very insulting. I am not an 8 year old kid anymore!

In hindsight I thought, maybe I was partially to blame ordering a burger at a Mediterranean joint but c'mon, it was the special that night!

The server seemed surprised when I showed her the brown disc. She informed me they ran out of fresh ground beef so I got a frozen one. Shame. I truly hope the next time this happens they just 86 their special & not serve garbage. I've had a better burger at a hospital at 3am. 

We will not be back.

Ps. Jimmy, I miss you bro :("
1,"The place was pretty deserted...I discovered  why. The inside has a slightly funky odor, like spoiled cheese and cheap wine. The owner was a sour faced jerk who demanded to know what I wanted. I'm assuming he was the owner because he had a European accent and his clothes were better than mine. And he had an aura of arrogance and authority.

That's all it took for me to turn around and walk out the door. If all French bistros are like this one, then I'm steering clear of them in general. Sophie's really sucks."
1,"About 7 years ago I purchased one of their mix-n-match 99.00 deals for my spare bedroom! After the set-up, I noticed that the box spring was completely made of cardboard!! The mattress was not much better and the WHOLE thing was thrown out in about 6 months! Well, I figured, you get what you paid for..my bad!! About 9 months ago I was back at Sleep America....thinking it was my mistake the last time...this time I spent almost 900.00 for a queen set for my teenage son. Every morning I have noticed a really funny sound when he is getting out of bed, and low and behold ...the box spring is CARDBOARD!!! MY BAD AGAIN for not inspecting, but I feel SOOO CHEATED!!! The mattress isn't that great either!! I will be replacing shortly and I can ASSURE you that I will NEVER step foor in a Sleep America again!! ughhh..BTW...it was not at this store...the store I purchased from was in Gilbert and is no longer there!"
5,"Went here for the first time today and I have to say that they have the best menudo I've had so far in the valley.

Service is a little slow but I kinda like that for a Saturday morning breakfast place... never feel like you are being rushed out the door.

I would like to come back and try some of their other food but for now I'll be coming back for the menudo"
5,"Went to Wild Thaiger for the first time last night and enjoyed every aspect.  Had the Wild Wrap and Dragon Eggs for appetizers.  Both had a really good bite to them without losing all of the different flavors in the dish.  That is something that gets lost at many Thai places, everything is so hot you lose the flavor.  Two of us had the Beef Panang for dinner and our friend had the Salmon dish.  All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.  

The restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.  Extremely rare to find in a Thai concept.  Love knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept.  We will definitely be back as this will be our new home for Thai in the valley."
1,Terrible customer service. Was denied the option to return items out of return window that was easily taken back and reimbursed at an alternate location. Was not allowed to talk to a manager when requested.  Disappointed this represents the LOFTs brand.
5,This is truly the best A/V company in the country. Their prices can't be beat by and far. Their sales reps are great and treat their customers great. I can't stop recommending this place to everyone that comes in to my office. If you need anything from a microphone to a full sound system give these guys a call.
5,"Killer Mexican Food! The chips 'n salsa kicks ass! You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip! Hellava start! A kick-butt margarita! Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST! Cannot wait to return! Great ambiance. Move Over, Manuels & TEE PEE....ew!"
1,"Who Owns This Franchise??  

The female manager (approx age 28) Dark Hair Sets a  Very Poor Example of Professional Leadership.
We were at this location recently late March on a Saturday at 2pm. Only staffed by one high school male,, he was doing his best to work with each person standing in line. 
A line of 10 at this point. 
I noticed a woman, man and a baby sitting at the back table. She caught my eye because all of sudden she went into the back and retrieved a frozen cake and walked it to the front where a customer was waiting. After handing it off she then walk back through our line and sat down again with the man and baby. The employee called out to her to ask a question. She yelled back the answer. After 17 minutes in line for two pints we asked the employee if that was his Manager (embarrassingly) he replied yes. We suggested he get another job and fast!! Gosh,,, Sam Fox is all over the place!!
This Managers choice, behavior, lack of leadership and responsibility is a disgrace to the working world. Many people would love to have her job and ""actually"" work instead of spend time not helping out when needed. 
                                     NEVER AGAIN WILL WE SHOP HERE!!"
5,"Best chips and salsa ever! Variety of chips.
Our favorites are the wontons and sweet potato chips Favorite margarita. Grand Canyon margarita the best ever! Only $4 during happy hour."
5,"Easily one of my favorite, authentic Mexican food spots.The menu has everything one could ever crave and the salsa bar provides a wide range of choices.  I have been looking for a great, down-home, authentic Mexican joint for three years--I finally found it. Perfect."
1,"Here is what I can legally say:

My brand new truck went in with flawless factory chrome wheels.  My brand new truck came out with a chunk taken out of the factory chrome wheels.

Also, they didn't dry the thing - I had the attendant come back twice to dry it but gave up with water spots on my car.

The manager, Andy, will most likely raise his voice to you and deny responsibility for the damage you receive, if he treats you the way he treated me.

I have been going to this car wash for years, and it has usually been nearly flawless.  Now the one time something bad happens for me there, they stand behind their ""flawless reputation"" and, in the words of their manager Andy, they are perfect and all the others who have said they damaged their vehicles are wrong... Strange.

I am waiting for the general managers response."
1,"Awful greasy Mexican food; margaritas from mix; no decor

Don't understand what restaurant the other reviewers went to."
1,Nice people. Not enough staff to accommodate walk-ins that they advertise for. Pretty sure Andy (technician) does not know how to do shellac. Didn't have all the bottled products. But said each product line is different. Placed my hands in the drier and the polish bubbled and my hands began to sting. I said I don't think this right seeing that I've had shellac done before. He said just put the tips of your fingers in. Still in pain I declined to go further and asked to have it removed.
1,"The decor was ok. Nothing special but there were some odd mylar stars and hot air balloons hanging from the ceiling

Came in for dinner and there are two other tables at 8:00 on a Thursday night.  I wonder if people go to bed early around this neighborhood or if this place just isn't that popular.

Coconut soup was weird .  A mix of hot coconut milk that's been watered down and then laden with sweetened baking coconut from a bag.  This was definitely not fresh coconut in any way and I found this soup to be disapointing.   

Lamb Saag was about as much lamb as you might expect for a dish costing 12.95. It's uniform liquidey sludge was a little too reminiscent of diarrhea for me and I lost a little of my appetite, though the lamb was tender and cooked well.  The overall dish was very very salty with no special taste.  Just a little spicy, a little Indian, and a little lamb.  They are probably using curry paste from a jar, or there is just not a very imaginative cook in the kitchen because the whole dish was lacking in flavor (besides salt).  A whole cardamom pod was left hidden in the diarrhea sludge, which led to an unpleasant burst of cardamom in one bite.

Rice had clearly been sitting around for awhile and was very dry throughout with crunchy bits and very chewy bits.  I just don't see how this is acceptable to serve someone in a restaurant.  Rice is one of the cheapest ingredients out there.  If the rice has been sitting for too long, throw it out and make more.  

I tried the saag with the rice and the oily mess of lamb Saag rehydrated the rice somewhat, and the rice's absorption of the Saag took away some of its saltiness.

Three sauces or chutneys that came with the papadom were not very good at all. 

Had to ask to have my water glass filled every single time I finished it. (this is a major pet peeve)"
5,"The Madison Mallards really understand how to throw a party. The  minor league franchise only offers big league thrills.They realize that the college-level baseball talent alone will not entertain most people; it's old school baseball -- low power numbers and high strategy (like sacrifices and manufacturing runs). As a result, they focus on value and entertainment. 

Inexpensive tickets, good and reasonable food/beverages are a Godsend. I just came from Milwaukee -- three tickets with views that do not require binoculars will run you over $100. A crap beer (Miller brands) in a plastic bottle runs another $6.50. The food is overrated and also price-inflated. At the warm Warner Park, I was able to get a seat right behind the dugout (word is that they are County Stadium relics) for $10! They offer 18 different beers including incredible Microbrews collectible plastic cups for $3.50 or less! Besides great beer, there were funnel cakes, TURKEY LEGS, burgers, brats and MUCH MORE. Their wait staff (yes, wait staff) is friendly and efficient with your orders, so you can enjoy the show. 

Four mascots are always running around the stadium rally-mongering and adding to the enjoyment. In between innings, the festivities including a t-shirt toss, bat spin, children and mascot races and more. The PA announcer consistently appeals to the good-natured (but peculiar) kitsch that fills a family-oriented outing (refers to foul balls as wieners or frankfurters for no particular reason). Check their web site -- their dates are chock-full of promos including autographed balls, celebrities (like the Fridge, Webster, Chewbacca and more) and post game events. 

Attending the Duck Pond (Mallards' park) re-energized my interest in baseball. The gurus behind the franchise understand the importance of the fan and do not take patronage for granted. Re-invest in America's past time without losing your wallet!"
5,Great food and service
5,"With so many places to eat Mexican food in Phoenix, this is my absolute favorite for Mexican casual dining. The staff is friendly and remembered me the 2nd time I ever came in, and every time since.  The ambiance and decor is fun and the food - oh the food is amazing!  I have brought several people here who doubted my claim of ""best in Phoenix"" and they all left agreeing with me.

I confess that I tend to stick to a few favorites and always over-order, but it's all so tasty!  Their super nachos are much more ""super"" if you put carne asada on them instead of the standard ground beef.  I had never had elotes con todos (corn with everything) before coming here, but somehow, steamed corn on a stick with mayo, chili powder and cheese is a winning combination. Who knew?  There is no way to eat this corn daintily but it's so good that I don't care.  I can floss later.

The carne asada or carnitas soft tacos are consistently high quality but the real reason I pilgrimage here from clear across town is the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi is perfectly seasoned and flaky, with homemade tartar sauce and queso fresco.  I personally skip the rice and beans because they do use lard in the beans and that doesn't always sit well with me.  The salsa verde from the always well stocked salsa bar is noteworthy and good on nearly everything and just a few drops of habanero salsa on my fish taco is enough for great flavor and a little kick without totally setting my insides on fire. If you like ceviche, try the tostada de ceviche - a great little value for the price - shrimp, avocado, onion, tomato and lime for under $3?  I couldn't make it for that cheap!

The latest development at La Tolteca is the construction of an outdoor BBQ grill just outside the entrance closest to the parking lot. Perhaps this will reduce smokiness inside from the somewhat poorly ventilated indoor grill.  That would be great.

Before you leave, be sure to pick up some churros and a fruit empanada or two, or even some arroz con leche (rice pudding) at the panaderia (bakery). Even if you (like me) ordered too much and don't have any room left for sweets, they're just as good as a late-night snack once you get home."
5,"We live just down from the Beach House.  We love going there. They are super friendly. We usually do not have to wait to be seated. The weekend breakfasts are the best. Bloody Marys are outstanding. Love the crab cakes eggs Benedict. Yum! Huge portion of walleye with your eggs which is one of my friends favs when they come visit. It is a great local hangout too, beautiful view, easy parking for your boat from lake waubesa. We recommend it always!"
1,"Got some take-out from there based on the reviews on this site.  Quite expensive and very low quality, like what one would expect from the crummy delivery places around here but not delivered and costing as much a a nice meal other places.  I usually think the 'good' chinese places have decent hot and sour soup, this stuff was the thick inedible slop straight out of a cheap buffet.

I dunno if I was expecting too much but this certainly did not deliver."
5,"We went back here this past Saturday night with a friend from out of town and liked it just as much as we did when we tried it a few months ago. My Cosmopolitan was just as big and tasty as it was last time, and the service was still attentive and friendly. My friend is a pescetarian/flexitarian (doesn't eat meat except for fish), and we were really pleased to find that all of the dishes we ordered that we usually get with meat were still absolutely delicious. Specifically, the Pad See Ew (which we usually get with chicken or beef) was still savory with just the fried tofu and perhaps even more amazing, the Mussaman curry (which usually comes with a deliciously braised beef) was still really flavorful and was complimented nicely by the tofu. Even after trying a decent number of other Thai places in Phoenix, we like Wild Thaiger for the full bar, consistently good flavors, great service, and fun atmosphere, and we will definitely continue to come here often."
5,"Stopped in this morning for breakfast and pie. They make great corned beef hash and home fries. The meat is hand cut from locally sourced beef, and all the ingredients are fresh and tasty. 
For pie my server Kim surprised me with strawberry rhubarb ala mode. Again fresh and delightful.  
Monty's offers fantastic diner food and a wide range of fruit and cream pies. You can't go wrong here."
1,"I would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone. Several negatives affect this review:

1. My car was broken into! This is a ""gated"" community where the gate doesn't work half of the time!
2. The apartment staff don't seem to care about their renters. Maintenance is a second thought, with little to no urgency. When asking about a piece of mail that was delivered to the office, they seemed to have no idea where it could have gone and keep no log of incoming or outgoing mail. On top of that, they didn't care enough to find the mail!
3. Grounds are kept at a minimum. Dog bags are refilled occasionally, bushes are cut haphazardly. Overall, just unkempt.

I'd say stay away from this place!!"
5,"I was in Madison overnight and ate at Monty's not once but twice.  The vegetarian food was that good.  Madison does not seem to have much in the way of vegetarian restaurants.  Monty's was at the top of the list when I did my research.  But the vegetarian menu at Monty's is pretty hard to beat, especially for a place that caters to carnivores as well (unusual).   About half of the menu is vegetarian-friendly, with a couple of vegan items as well.  The veggie meatloaf was the best of the food we ate (not including the pie), but the tempeh in the veggie BLT was nicely prepared too.  We didn't try breakfast items, but tofu scrambler was available and looked great.  The food was delicious, the desserts were enormous and divine, and we thought the service was fast and friendly.  We were there on a Sunday evening and a Monday lunch, and neither time did we wait for a table.  I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a restaurant for both the carnivores and the herbivores, while satisfying both groups.  That's not easy to do, and Monty's did it well."
1,I was terribly upset with this restaurant. Their prices are absurd for the casual dining experience which made their disinterest in pleasing their customers even more inexcusable. They serve a Caesar salad which is served as a whole leaf. I do not enjoy cutting it up at the table with lettuce sliding off the plate and messing the table area. I requested as I ordered it that it be cut before serving it. They refused saying it doesn't look as good. When I said that i didn't mind if the presentation was compromised and I would enjoy it more cut up. They again said no. They were too busy. Additionally they took some old standbys off the menu. High prices and no regard for customer satisfaction is a bad combination.
1,"I take my BBQ seriously and because of that I researched on-line via Yelp and other sites various reviews of BBQ places in Madison, finally deciding on Smoky Jon's No 1 B-B-Q.  Clearly the ribs have been highly reviewed so I actually went for the full slab.  Then it was a choice between the chopped pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich, I went for the pork sandwich from my fond memories of the same in Alabama.  Ordering over the phone, everything seemed to go well.  I then arrived about a half hour later.  There was 1 person in front of me who paid and was getting ready to leave when they brought my order to the counter and it was clearly wrong.  They had given my order to the man before me and I had his.  Apparently we both had the same first name.  Now this I was not perturbed by and was okay with, it was what followed that made me give this place 1 star.  So the counter lady tells me she'll take care of me first before resolving his issue, great!  So she charges my card for 64.66 which was clearly way more than I should have paid for 1 slab dinner and 1 pork sandwich + 1 side of fried dough.  Should have been 1/2 that.  I told her and she couldn't understand what I was talking about, I had to over-explain what I ordered and finally got through to her.  She took the bag back to the kitchen area saying some guy would have to deal with fixing this problem.  Now I was getting irritated.  She refunds me around 32 bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge.  I get a new bag of food and am finally done with the transaction, took about 15 mins to resolve.  Fine, I was happy in knowing I had a great dinner to enjoy soon.

So I come back and begin with the ribs, 1/2 a slab.  From the first taste I was not impressed.  I've had better ribs all over the country from Los Angeles to Alabama to Texas and Chicago.  Seriously?  This place has won all kinds of awards, I don't get it.  Almost every other place I've eaten ribs in my 40+ years of life has been better than this place.  The ""sugar-fried"" biscuits are nothing with nothing, you can get better donuts nearly anywhere, seriously (again).  The fries dipped in the BBQ sauce were the best part by far.  The corn was pretty good too, but still a little over the top on the taste, hard to describe.  So after being disappointed, I checked out the pork sandwich, and oddly enough there were 3 small containers with the sandwich, and somehow it didn't look like pork either.  I examined further, it was chicken, yet another screw-up with my order, wow!  And I ordered fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which was included.  Instead I found off-the-shelf beans, apple sauce (why?) which is not homemade, just spooned out of the jar, and the third container was BBQ sauce, which I didn't need since I bought a whole bottle.  So the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect.  And note, the chicken was not anything to write home about either.  I drove to the other side of Madison, which was a fairly pleasant 1/2 hour drive, paid around 33 bucks for a very disappointing experience.

I strongly recommend NOT going to this place, unless you like to take risks, maybe you'll like what you find, I know that if this is the best in Madison, I'll have to go elsewhere in the world to find good BBQ.

Oh well..."
5,"Best food, best service, great prices!"
1,eh.
5,"Went here with a friend of mine that has been here quite often in the past. I can see why he likes it. I had two soft tacos, a carne asada and a grilled chicken. They both tasted great, had fresh garnishes, and a good amount of cheese without being overwhelming like some places are. Free salsa bar with good choices, and if you're a drinker they also serve margaritas and had several varieties of beer for sale. Planning to take my daughter here in a few weeks when I'm up this way again."
1,"I've never had a hard time at a sonic before, except for this location. They barely speak English, they don't know their own menu, and they messed up my order 2 times. Come on, your job can not be that confusing..."
5,"We held a brunch at Coach and Willies for family memebrs on sunday after our wedding. The manager Kevin had been in touch with me and had reserved us a private room just off the dining room for some privacy(at no extra charge)!!!! The service was excellent and the food was greatly enjoyed by everybody. We had people in from St Louis, Lexington, KY, Chattanoga, TN and everyone raved about the food. My wife and I eat there often for lunch and Sunday brunch. Food is always good and atmosphere is great with all the TV's. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone needing a great place to entertain."
5,"Much favor has been heaped in previous reviews and no dissent here. This place is great; eaten here many a time. Easy to get to from anywhere in the valley, at corner of I-17 and Central Ave. 

Excellent food, great service--even for a party of 22. Nice beverage assortment. Try a cold Carta Blanca, instead of a Modelo or that shite that begins with the third letter of the alphabet. 
And, by all means, order a Vampiro, if you've not tried one. Tequila, Sangrita, and Squirt soda pop--muy rico!"
5,I really like both Chinese restaurants in town.  This one has outstanding crab rangoon.  Love the chicken with snow peas and mushrooms and General Tso Chicken.  Food is always ready in 10 minutes which is accurate.  Good place and they give you free pop.
5,"When it comes to activities for kids, this is one of the best. We had a great time here, spent about 4 hours just roaming all the floors of the various science fields. 

We went on Veterans Day and the had a poster for the kids to sign for our Military services men and women."
5,"Go home with fresh tortillas, warm off the stone, and stuff your face with cafeteria-style food.  This place is proof that there is a God, and He loves Mexican food."
5,"Located within walking distance of Bank One Ballpark (MLB's Diamondbacks) and US Airways Center (NBA's Phoenix Suns) Majerle's (owned by three-time NBA all-star and local icon Dan Majerle) is a great place to go before and after a game. 

Weekend afternoons--game day or not--are relatively quiet, which means quick service and an attentive wait staff.  And while the food is typical of most sports grills (burgers, sandwiches, and fried appetizers, for example), it's a great place to unwind or to escape the Phoenix heat.  There are the requisite large televisions tuned to the day's sporting events and plenty of memorabilia lining the walls.  Despite these sports bar staples, the place is actually quite cozy and quaint.

But while Majerle's is good in the afternoons, it absolutely rocks after Suns or D-Backs games.  The place is typically packed and it's not uncommon to find local or visiting athletes sipping beers on the narrow sidewalk patio.  The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).  The spontaneity of patrons singing duets with the bartender or serenading their dates to late-'80s pop ballads makes for a great party-like atmosphere."
1,"Wow..never thought there is a difference between dive bars and found out there is a big difference.  This place should be categorize as a shit bar instead of a dive bar! 

Called about 1:30 and ask about employment there and was told by some bitch working there said ""no we are not hiring"" and then with her stupid uneducated trailer trash bitch attitude ass added ""if you are in the business,  you should know not to call during lunch!"" 

Its 1:30, past lunch time ""rush"" and this bitch had to open her probably fat, pimple faced mouth and give this rude comment?! This was so uncalled for!!

So I went in this shitty place to complain (so glad I did not applied at this nasty ass place-which I did not understand why anybody else did not smell or see how nasty this place really is!) and asked for the manager. This  nasty toothless so called""waitress"" said he was bartending and was busy! I still spoke to this (piece of shit Is way too much nice of a word for this asshole!)manager and was treated again like a piece shit and he bitched me out saying ""if you are not a customer, I don't have time for your shit and come back later!!"" 

Well the only time I would come back to this shitty bar if I ever wanted a staff infection or hepatitis from the gross bathrooms! 

How can anybody eat at a place where the management treats anyone this way??!!  I would never eat here and wouldn't anyone else eat at this place!!"
1,"Let me preface this review by saying two things: 1. if there was an option for negative stars, I'd give it and 2. I just ate there about 20 minutes ago and am still feeling pissed off. My husband and I were in the mood for a good breakfast this morning, so we got to thinking...Matt's? Matt's is always awesome, but we didn't feel like waiting out in the rain for over an hour. The Original Pancake House? It's a close second so we opted for that and headed out. Once we got there, we realized 350 other people had the same idea as us and the wait would be about an hour. Not feeling like waiting, we hopped back in the car and jumped on our phones to check out what Yelp thought would be good nearby. Linda's was one of the places that popped up along our drive and we had both passed it a few times, always talking about wanting to try it. We looked at the reviews and there were lots of good ones raving about the food (Really? Guy who said it was Matt's with pie? Really? I don't know where the hell you get off, but I'm holding you partially responsible for totally jacking up my Sunday breakfast). We got inside and the place is a real shithole. I don't mind, because I typically love eating at shady looking places and drinking in dive bars. It's like a real ""slice of life"" type of thing and I find the experience usually excels where the decor is lacking. Everything was blue and mauve...I haven't seen this much mauve since the late 80's. And again, that would usually be fine, except in this case, it doesn't look like anyone has cleaned the place since then either. Everywhere I looked, things were grimy and just not...clean. We sat at the counter (first mistake) and both ordered the JJ's Special (second mistake). Sitting at the counter was like having a backstage pass to a Michael Bolton show...or some other really shitty person you would never want to see backstage. We could see the entire operation and hear the cook bitching the whole time. That's right, I said cook. Singular. One person working in the kitchen. She came out a few times to yell at our server, called Linda (I sincerely hope it was not the owner Linda). She looked like the grandma from Napolean Dynamite. For those of you that get the reference, enough said. We could hear the dinging of microwave ovens and the grumbling of Napolean Dynamite's grandma in the weeds with tickets that she couldn't read due to Linda's supposedly shitty handwriting. We waited over a half hour for our food. Granted, we didn't have to wait to sit but seriously, a half hour for eggs, bacon and pancakes. When the food came out I was already over it. I took one look at the plate and knew this was not going to be good. My ""over-easy"" egg had totally runny whites and looked more like a sunny-side-up gone wrong. My bacon looked like it came from Fry's and the pancakes were the only edible thing on my plate. I don't know if they were edible because everything else was so totally shitty or if it was because I am 9 months pregnant and would have eaten shit cakes at that point. Nevertheless, the ambiance combined with the service and the food made for the absolute worst $28 I've ever spent on breakfast. $28 dollars!! For me and my husband to have pancakes, eggs, bacon and coffee. That did NOT include toast or potatoes and half the plate was inedible. It makes my blood boil just thinking of it and as I sit here writing, I am still starving. We should have just gone to the brass rail. Better service, better food quality (I am not joking) and it would have been $5.50 a person for the same meal. You fooled me once Linda. Shame on me. You won't be fooling me again!"
5,"Kind of a sketchy area and older machines (similar to the ones I had my old apartment complexes in Berkeley), but I give this place 5 stars.

1.  Soap, bleach, and detergent dispenser ($0.50) each 
2.  Change machine
3.  Regular washers for $1.50 a load
4.  Oversize washers for $3.00 a load
5. Convenience store right next door if you are hungry or thirsty
6. Huge dryers $0.25 for 9 minutes
7. THIS PLACE HAS WIFI!!!

And the wifi is way faster than my stupid AT&T Uverse internet at home."
5,"This is one my favorites. It's huge, the staff is far to nice, it's organized, high quality merchandise, and gasp its CLEAN. When I lived in Madison I scored tons and tons of awesome things from this store, it was magical. Their furniture is second to none. Its farther away than other thrift store from UW so its harder for the kids to get to. (ie  NOT PICKED OVER)"
5,Great place and beautiful patio!  Adovo Chicken Pasta and Poblano Chicken Chowder are favorites!
1,Had this for lunch one day before work - bad move. I was totally useless all afternoon as I felt like I had a brick of acid eating away at my stomach lining.
1,"CLICKS IS CLOSED.

GOOD LUCK to the great staff who worked so hard!  RIP Click's Billiards!"
1,"I really enjoy applebees but this one did not mix my perfect margarita correctly.   I drove 20 minutes so I could have my perfect and an decent meal to receive a bitter drink not mixed to the recipe and not measured correctly. 

Consistency is everything."
5,Surprised I never found this place.. The place was pretty good couldn't think of a complaint
5,"I love this library. Love it. It is beautiful and quite large with a quiet room full of magazines (you can check out the ones from the previous months), piles of documentary DVDs, quiet corners to sit/hide in, screened porches that are open during the non-winter months, four self-check stations, an open area where you can fetch your own holds (and thanks to the wonders of technology you don't have to worry about somebody snaking your long-awaited stuff away from you), bunches of computers with access to the internet (even if you had to bring your impatient 3-year-old who thinks the word 'quiet' means 'be louder'), and a great used-book store run by some very sweet retirees. And that's just the stuff I've used. 

There are two different graphic novel sections: one for adults and one for kids. Finally, maybe my *most* favorite thing, is the Staff Picks section. It's mostly books but with a few DVDs too; I've found some worthy stuff there. 

There are dedicated children's librarians, friendly people at the information/reference desk (with little plaques that say please interrupt us), and book returns both inside and out. I've always been pro-library, but this place is just unbelievable. I feel so lucky to live near it."
1,"This store discriminates against customers who may have problems carrying items since you are not allowed to take a cart out.  Why is that?  Target next door lets you take your cart to your car, are they discriminating against the Ross clientele (I've seen a review calling this store ""ghetto."" I see no difference in Target and Fry's customer base and Ross'.  I did go there because a friend had gotten a good deal on a furniture accessory but then realized I couldn't carry it to my car because of back issues.   I did mention this to security..he said I could drive up (that's a very busy area),I also mentioned it to the cashier and when a very nice man heard me he offered to carry it out to the car.  Also the wait was long because they shut down one register so the cashier could stack up hangars!  so hangars are more important than a line of customers. most of the store was dirty, disorganized, lacking price tags, etc.  never again!"
5,"We've been customers for years, and this is a great place to go for wine. The owners not only know their stock, once they get to know you they always have a recommendation for you. It's also a cigar bar with an extensive selection. 

I've found some lovely wines here. When I want an absolutely excellent bottle of wine for a special occasion, this is the place I go."
5,"Dear That's A Wrap,

I've only met you once, but it was love at first sight... I found you easily - on 7th street just north of McDowell and lots of parking in your private lot made me happy. I walked in and felt comfortable immediately - very casual, laid back atmosphere and welcoming staff. Since my lunch companion was a little late, I had time to observe the place, the menu, and even read a New Times that was out for your patrons. A few things I noticed during my wait:

1 - you are incredibly fast and efficient!
2 - you have smoothies on the back of the menu and they look delicious!
3 - you don't mind when people special order
4 - I didn't hear any whining or complaining at all while I was there

The list could go on, but my friend arrived and we ordered.  I had the 'Veggie Jackson' wrap - no onions or rice, add tofu with a side of fresh fruit. My friend had the 'Very Brady Clubster' with a side of fruit as well. We both commented how delicious our wraps were and the fruit was good too! The veggies in my sandwich were grilled to perfection and the combination of flavors from the feta and balsamic salsa blended just right.  I felt like each bite was a party in my mouth.  Sounds cheesy, but I swear, it's true!  Serving size was perfect and so was the price!  (Everything on the menu is $6.95 or less and even if you add chicken or tofu, it's less than $1).

It's going to be kind of a hike for me since I'm moving further north, but I will be back for sure...

See you soon, my new love!

:)Gabi"
1,Very frustrating experience.  Our order was very simple but the cashier couldn't get it right.  While waiting for our food I watched the beleaguered manager apologizing to every table.  Every customer had a problem with their food or order.  We waited twenty minutes for our food and decided to leave.   I have never experienced more incompetence.  Never again.....
5,"they have the best ice cream ever. it is better than any ice cream or gelato shop i've ever been too.

i'm addicted to the bubblegum, which is labeled something like chiclet or chica. it is bright blue. and it is heaven in my mouth."
5,"BEST. ITALIAN BEEF. EVER!  

AND, Samantha ROCKS!!!"
5,"Bossman has been whining ever since Shogun Express on Camelback closed a few years ago. Yogi's and Yoshi's and wherever else we tried never really cut it. A Yelp search brought up Blue Fin, and although it's a little further than normal to fetch lunch, I mentioned it to him and he agreed to try it. And glad we were! 

We had the daily special ($7.29), which consisted of teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, 2 spring rolls and drink, and an order of sunomono ($1.29). Opt for all white meat (+$0.75) and brown rice (+$0.30). It was a lot of food. The salad was meh, and in the same box as the teriyaki, so it was kinda warm by the time I got back to the office (at least the dressing was in a separate container). Probably won't order the special again, just to avoid the salad. The rice was perfect, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic. Thinly sliced (not in chunks like all the other joints) and no yucky gristle or fat hanging off. If anything, maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce. The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked, but still good. The sweet & sour sauce looked kinda grainy, but tasted just fine. Sunomono was great. Overall, the best teriyaki bowl in the area!

I picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible, based on other reviews. But there were only a couple other cars in their small lot. There were 25-30 people scattered around the inside & outside tables, so I'm guessing they either foot it, or take the light rail, which stops just out front. Also, they have a drive up window. I'm not sure if you can order it there or if it's just for pickup, but it'd be convenient with a phone-in order next time! The staff was SUPER friendly, to boot! 

P.S. They accept Visa & Mastercard, but not AmEx or Discover."
5,"Wow! All I can say is WOW! From January to May 2013, I used MariLuz (sp?) as my brow stylist. She really brought out the best in my brows, making them perfect over time. Now that I've left PHX and moved to ABQ, I sure do miss her! I wish I could take her with me. Here in PHX, my eye brows have been murdered and skin pulled off of my eye lids. (Yes, I was at an Aveda concept salon) Once they grow out, if I can afford it, I'll fly to PHX for the day to have MariLuz fix them for me."
1,"This restaurant would've received four stars because the chicken red curry was spicy and tasty, the happy hour cocktail was great, and the edamame was perfectly salted. And even though our server was a newbie, she was still attentive and got answers to all our happy hour and menu Qs.

Unfortunately, none of this matters because I got food poisoning. I'm guessing from the chicken because no one else in my party got ill and I was the only one who ordered chicken. Worst 48 hours of my life. I'll never return."
1,"I went in to have cateract eye surgery in both of my eyes which began in Nov. 2012.  The two surgeries were done 2 weeks apart.  I was sold for an additional $7000.- above Medicare and Blue Cross charges to have  lens implants that would not require me to wear glasses after the surgeries.  One of the lens's that was implanted in my eye was not centered and 3 weeks later, it had to be removed and replaced with a different lens.  Both eyes had laser surgeries.  My left eye also had retina work after the initial implant (supposedly my retina was torn in 3 places.  Also in my left eye, I had to have cornea surgery on my eyelids.  Finally after 7 months of office visits and surgeries, I decided to get a second opinion from an outside opthamoligist.  He explained to me that the LensX ($7000.-) should NOT have been used for me due to my stigmatisms.  I asked why Dr Perkins recommended it to me, and was told that it was all about additional money.  To date, my vision has become alot worse prior to going in to Barnet Dulaney Perkins.   NOW, I have eye glasses for both reading and distance.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY- THEY ARE A TOTAL BUNCH OF CROOKS AND NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL."
1,"I am an avid Chiptole fan, but never have I had as terrible service as I did today at this location. 

I used the online ordering method to order my food for my lunch. My email confirmation said that my food would be ready at 2:45. We arrived at 2:45 on the dot, ready to pick up our food. Upon telling the cashier that we ordered online, she argued with me saying there was no online order in her system. I then told her I had an email confirmation. She then ""went to the back"" and appeared with none other than my order sheet that had not been fulfilled. She then handed it to the person at the beginning of the assembly line to start making it and asked me if I was ready to pay, after I had already told her I had paid for it online. 

The person making our order made the first thing wrong and we asked him to correct it, that was actually the least of my concerns, that happens, I get that. So then we just asked him if it would be easier for us to just tell him what we ordered. They then went through the line to make our order but for some reason were moving at the slowest pace I have ever seen at any Chiptole location, there was no sense of urgency and I had placed my order over a half hour before arriving, mind you, there was no line, which is rare for any Chiptole, so it really made no sense that our service was this poor. 

We asked the girl at the cashier what we could do differently so that this wouldn't happen again and her response was that sometimes their system doesn't link up to whatever system is in the back and that was why our order wasn't ready. We left at 3:07. 

So an order I placed at 2:20, was supposed to be ready at 2:45, and we left at 3:07. That is 22 minutes for an order that was placed online. 

I will not be going to that Chiptole ever again. And will defintely think twice before ordering online with you guys, very disappointing. :("
1,"Booked online for an 8:15 a.m. ride to the airport.  The site gave me a confirmation number.  At 8:18 a.m., we called in, and an automated message said a cab had been assigned and was on its way.  At 8:30 a.m., we called in again and noticed that the automated message said that ""cab zero"" was assigned, which didn't sound good, so we spoke with a human who said that the online submission had not specified a regular or special cab.  I was pretty sure I had specified ""regular cab""--but if there was some uncertainty, why not call me at the phone number provided, before the time I was expecting a ride?  We ended up having to drive to the airport and park in short-term parking for a week in order to catch our flight.  Discount Cab, by contrast, has always shown up reliably on time when booked via their website, and I will use them from now on."
5,"Friday = Great Fish Fry.  All you can eat ocean perch.  Big bowls of slaw, tartar sauce, and lemon chunks on the table.  Dignified and refined, I wouldn't eat perch anywhere else in Madison."
5,"I have been going to the Matador since I was little when it was a little hole in the wall on 2nd Street.  They have always had great Sonoran style Mexican food!  It's always our go to place when we attend events downtown or have business to attend to. They also have the best hot sauce in town!  As far as the service,  the food comes out quickly and we never really have to wait long.  If you're downtown and looking for great food I would highly recommend this place."
5,Needed a place to eat before departure and stumbled on this place. Very  nice people and the food was delish. We ordered tacos and quesadilla - fresh tortillas and fresh meat and huge portions for a very low price ! We were very amazed and left extremely full and satisfied with the service and hospitality we received. I would totally come again!
5,"At a recent game 3 of the 5 people in my party (myself included)  were stung by hornets.  I can't say enough good about the staff response. The medics took great care of us. They cheered up our kid really well and then the manager gave us all new seats behind home plate with food and beverage too. We really enjoyed the rest of the game. Also they did deal with the hornets I promise. 

I have been to a bunch of other Mallards games too, and I always have a blast."
1,"Ya know, I've come to this Denny's on and off since moving to Phoenix several years ago.  I usually only frequent this location and one in Tempe.  I'm not really sure when it changed.

Hubs and I stopped for breakfast.  We looked at the line @ Matt's (I know there IS no comparison but the line was SOOOOOOOOOOOO long) and turned around to get one of the worst tasting meals and worst service experiences I've had in a long time.  

Now, I understand something going wrong with your order now and again.  But seriously, our waitress was training someone!!!!!  An order was taken and then we were left to fend for ourselves.  Finally another waitress named Crystal (ask for HER if you dare go) stopped by and filled our coffee.  We then waited...and waited.  We saw the cooks working and putting food out that just sat under the lamps.  When we got our grand slams the only thing slightly warm were the eggs.  Sausage?  Stone cold.  Bacon: frigid.  Pancakes, laughable.

And when the manager stopped by?  Let's just say that he had a very condescending attitude.  He was basically like; ""well, what do you want me to do about it?""  Um, manage your people effectively!  Live up to the customer service standards expected of you!  Figure it out.  My husband pretty much put him in his place by giving a detailed description of several things he'd seen done wrong since our arrival.

He offered us ONE comped meal.  Bill still came to $15 for one breakfast and drinks.  Yikes.  For this kind of money I will stand in line at Matt's and know that eventually I'll get food worth having!"
5,"What an amazing organization for empowering women. 

They have a really amazing mentor program. The program starts in some coursework and sociology to sort of prepare us. The classes were a blast and quite useful. The Mentor I met was incredibly helpful warm and kind and had great insight. I really miss our visits since I moved away because she was a wise lady with clear perspective. I really think that the Fresh Start staff went an extra mile and a half by placing me with a mentor who really was perfect for the path that I am on.

Fresh Start also brought in some business training associates and gave out scholarships for them. I might have participated had I not been working at the time and had conflicting hours. I was offered a scholarship at the time and I think that any woman who applied herself would qualify.

Fresh start has an impressive job database.

They always had so many wonderful energetic staff who really transmitted a lot of information and light.

Really wonderful organization.

A+++"
5,"Excellent coffee, quick and friendly service and fair prices. There should be more of these places around. Like the little stickers on the lids too. I think mine said ""bean juice"" today."
1,"I'm on the hated-it scale of the Honey Bear love fest.  

We ordered the bbq ribs and a beef sandwich with cole slaw and cowbro beans on the side.  Thought the meal was on the below average scale for tastiness...the beef sandwich meat suffered from not being marinated, and it was bone dry...the bbq rib was more of the same...so this would have been a 2 star review...BUT what pushed it down to 1 star for me was that my ribs were ""bloody""...No not pink, but actually bloody with the jelly-like texture of raw meat...great when I'm eating sushi, but not so much for bbq pork

I actually returned the bloody thing to the counter person who agreed that it was bloody and made me a new plate...unfortunately, it was a new plate of the same bloody ribs, I gave up and just trashed the bloody plate....so no, I won't be back for another try

If you're looking for tasty bbq sandwich...try TEXAZ for lunch...that's where I'd be the next time I have a craving"
5,"We drove 45 minutes through rain and rush hour darkness to get here, but were not disappointed. Service was fast and we had two great beers and our soup before we knew it. One of the best beer lists in town too! Great homemade chips and french onion dip and a locally made pretzel with great dips came next. Smelt fry was great! Very lightly breaded as advertised (nothing like the pre breaded frozen kind) and great tartar sauce. Pizza had great thin crust. We would definitely come back again for many reasons."
1,"We came out on a Saturday night. We understand it is busy and there is going to be a wait. We checked in with our name, party of two, was told it was going to be about a 30 min wait, got our pager, and waited outside since the lobby/foyer was crowded. There were a few parties waiting outside too. 

40 minutes have passed, we came inside and checked to see the status of where our name was. Apparently our pager was dead, they called our name 10-15 minutes ago. We were put off by the manager/supervisor's attitude, he was really rude.  He made it seem like it was our fault we didn't hear our names called because we were standing right outside and that our pager was dead. I saw that they were calling names inside and outside, but the only called outside every other time. 

This kind customer service at the beginning set the mood for the evening...not fun. We always try to have a positive attitude, but it was kind of sad when someone that is representing the restaurant is not welcoming, we didn't really want to be there anymore. We stayed though because we are not rude. 

They did seat us about a minute after.

Our waiter was awkward too, but he tried. 

We always like to come out here to have our favorite appetizer and dessert. We live 30 min away, so we like to make night of it when we decide to come out."
1,"the bakery is okay but the service is terrible; went in on Saturday to pick up a cake I paid for and ordered on Tuesday; Waited 40 minutes and then when they finally got to me they said they had not started on the cake yet! I waited 40 minutes and there were only 2 people ahead of me. 3 employees walked by and did not aknowledge the wait; They told me to come back (too bad I pre-paid for the cake) and did not apologize, just went to the next customer; there are much better European bakeries in N. Central such as Karl's or Jana's that are better bakeries and better in service"
5,"I am a huge fan of MCM, so it's no surprise that I am now a big fan of Red Modern Furniture.  The space is lovely and large.  And it is filled with beautifully maintained vintage pieces.  I was charmed when the sales person (owner?) walked up to me and said ""May I help you find something?  Each piece has a story.""  Indeed.  In my mind I purchased a desk (circa 1930), a walnut platform bed (danish, circa 1960), 2 oversized lamps, and a coffee table that wouldn't fit anywhere in my house.  As I sadly walked to the door, I noticed a take-out box stamped ""Lola Tapas"" next to the register.  ""Oh, is Lola good? I've been meaning to check it out.""  ""Well, I'm a little biased.  My brother owns Lola.  He also opened a coffee shop called Lux.  And he is opening a cafe next to Lola soon.""  That opened the door.  We proceeded to discuss the various independent restaurants of the Phoenix-metro for the next several minutes.  Kindred spirits, for sure.  

(Side note:  The store also carries art and a small selection of vintage clothing and accessories.)"
5,"I hadn't checked Yelp before going here, but it's on the light rail and I've been wanting to eat here for weeks. It just so happened that I was split between two offices today and Blue Fin was in the middle. So, I exited off McDowell and was treated to the amazing aromas of BF. 

Upon entering, I'm greeted by the nicest lady I might have ever met. She admires my plaid jacket. (BTW, there's a Yelp sticker on the door!) After reviewing the menu--which has a good selection of choices--I decide on the panko fish over white rice. That wonderfully kind lady was sad to see me leave because she wouldn't get to see if I liked my food. Waiting at the LR station, I was glad I picked up an extra pair of chop sticks because some crazy-eyed man was looking at my bag. Although it had been about 10 minutes from the time I received my food to the time I walked back into my office, the food hadn't really cooled down all that much. Nice! The fish was super crispy on the outside yet marvelously moist inside. And the rice was good too. 

I'll definitely be back, kind lady. And hopefully I'll be able to eat there with you so you know how much I appreciate great food and expectational service."
1,"Ok Im giveing Del Taco one more chance....

I go in what is your best chicken Idem....

um Burrito or taco? he asks

Have you had the Burrito?

no....I haven't had ethier...

Have any one eaten anything here? I ask the rest of the resturant crew....they All shake there heads no....

ok so even if the food was discounted or free no one should ever eat del taco.....regardless I did eat a burrito.....

and my worst fears where confirmed....I could have dumpster dove at a taco bell and gotten better food......

Feed me bad food once, shame on you.....Feed me bad food 4 times Shame on ME...."
5,My baby turned me on to this place.  I love it so much. Such a good place to eat
5,"Pizza very good, mike the bartender was awesome. Keep up great work."
1,"I never thought any fast food (outside of In N Out) would get more than 4 stars. Besides the fact that their food tastes like roadkill, I'm still amazed. Only in Phoenix."
1,I avoid this place!  They play extrememly loud music on Saturday nights till 2am. I will not go there until they change their practices.
1,"Avoid this corrupt company... terrible! 
I sent my wife in for an oil change and to get the brakes looked at because they were squeeking.
They did the oil change and told her that the rotors would have to be ground down or replaced and the rear brakes needed to be cleaned, the bill would be about $400.00
I said no, bought $18.00 brake pads from another company, and did the repair myself in about an hour
When I looked at the rotors, they were LIKE GLASS, in immaculate condition, absolutely did not require any grinding/replacement...  (the vehicle is only a few years old, with low mileage) 
They completely tried to take advantage of my wife, fabricated a completely false story about the vehicle to try to make a quick buck... they should be shut down... 
You've been warned!!"
1,"Bad wash as usual and NO customer service. Now they expect you to do what they can do in 30 seconds (change my new license plate number in their system) - now the customer has to go online and do it. Convenient yes - but never going back!!! The good news is they get you in and out quickly, the bad news is the quality of the wash leaves little to be desired and they beat you up for everything from windshield repair to oil changes to details and so on. After many years, I have had enough!!!"
1,Thats not BBQ...its meat with BBQ sauce :(((
1,"This is probably the worst Ulta when it comes to customer service. I am not a needy customer and more often than not I prefer to be left alone to do my shopping. However, I do appreciate being acknowledged and I am even more a fan of having my questions answered in the event that I do need some assistance. This is not the case at this location. The salesgirls seem unfriendly and completely uninterested in helping/recommending/selling. I honestly wonder if being as unhelpful as possible is part of their job description. If it is, then they are doing stellar!"
5,I can't decide which is better the Philly cheesesteak or the onion rings...both are delicious! If i worked in Phoenix I would eat here all the time.
1,"Went by this place last week and it is now closed down..

Looked like they are preparing to raze the building."
5,"What an amazing night! Exactly what every theater experience should be :)

The seats are comfortable, I had a great view of the stage, the show (Daddy Long Legs) was one of the best musicals I have ever seen. Seriously. It was put on by the Arizona Theater Company & from casting to sets, it was impeccable. You will not see traveling shows here & that, in a way, makes it even more fun. 

If you like supporting local businesses & you love the theater, you can't do better than this place!"
5,"Fun, cheap, challenging course. It is my favorite in Madison for the price. Not sure why anybody would pay $16 to walk 9 at a city course when you can do the same here. 

It's a unique course, not links style but has plenty of marsh/ native grass. If you hit an errant tee shot you will be punished. 

Often times you will see cool wildlife. One time I saw about 7 muskrats. Another time I saw 7 deer."
5,"Love the food, staff, and atmosphere for games! Salmon salad is great, along with their wings. Recommend this place for a laid back and hometown experience."
1,"I go to Hooter's every now and then with the husband to get some drinks and appetizers. The food is never why we go here so I am not going to comment on it in this review, it is neither good or bad, just average.

What was hard to take were the girls they have working here. In any other eating place I could care less about appearances and focus on cleanliness and friendliness of our server. But this is after all...Hooters.

The uniforms are mentioned in another review and this is what caught my eye as well. Shorts either baggy or just not flattering to the shape that is squeezed into them. Runs in panty hose...very tacky...and the tank tops were dingy.

There was only one cute girl that was serving and the hostess was adorable. The rest were frightening. One girl's face was peeling from what looked to be a horrible sunburn...it was so disturbing. Our waitress had acne all over her face and chest...very unappetizing. The attitudes of these girls brought the mood of the place way down.These girls need to at least smile and try to be friendly.

Needless to say we will most likely not return to this Hooters...sorry ladies."
1,will give you the shits.
5,"I have been to every restaurant in and around Chase Field and the US Airways Center and Coach and Willies is hands down the best.

We went there a few days ago.  I ordered the chicken parm and Roz got the Sherry's Chicken Salad.  The bar is BEAUTIFUL.  It is sunken into the floor and covered in granite.  The patio is huge with a beautiful fountain out front. 

Before the food came out, I looked for the bathroom and found myself upstairs.  They have a ""VIP Lounge"" with a private bar and huge upper-patio.  Fortunately, I found the bathroom too!

I get back downstairs to discover this massive chicken parmesan sandwich.  Roz's salad was beautiful... spinach, with fresh strawberries, almonds, and vinaigrette.  It was SO GOOD!  I got STUFFED on my sandwich.  I don't know how people eat it all.

We had to run to the game and unfortunately the D-Back lost!!!!  Coach and Willies is a great find.  We had a great tasting meal, in a beautiful place, that was enormous!!!  I found my new lunch spot!!!!"
5,"Part of the charm of this place is that it is in a poor residential neighborhood in downtown Phoenix, not far from 7th St.  Also, you could easily drive by and not even notice it exists.  So charming and the loveliest of dives you will ever visit (or shizzhoels as I call them).

Now, about the food and experience.  When you walk inside there is only about 8 or so counter seats in what looks like a converted studio home/living room.  The feeling when you walk in however, is that someone beamed you into the 1950's.  Authentic and totally retro.

Now, the best for last... the food is not your typical diner food.  Much more creative and original than any diner I have ever been to.  And being from NY I KNOW diners!  Practically grew up in them.  This diner, while having a VERY limited menu (when compared to any NY diner), each and every dish is incredible.  Try the Big Jim!  It will wow you... Fried Chicken breast  with cheddar, bacon, homemade biscuit buns and gravy.  Wowah!  (Oh, and definitely not the dish or the place to be if you wanna eat healthy!  More the once in a blue moon calorie splurge place... at least for me.)

Oh and order off the menu the ""Cannibal Fries"".  Simply off the chain.  Fresh cut potato fries with caramelized onions, cheddar and homemade russian dressing.  (Deep Breath!)"
5,"Welcome Diner has become one of my Phoenix favorites. 

It's hard to tell which stands out the most, their amazing food preparations or their welcoming staff. 

1st patronage: we were able to sit inside the tiny trailer and the guys who were working that day were awesome. Great customer service, made us feel known and welcomed! That day I enjoyed the Welcome Burger with no regrets! Husband got the Big Jim & was very satisfied! 

2nd patronage: I popped by for an iced coffee (they serve Lux brew) , and the gal working (can't remember her name now, but she's got blue hair ;) was super friendly! She even hooked me up with a refill for the price of free, I was like wow, these folks are nice :)

3rd patronage: we weren't feeling meat, so we tried the Vegan Po' Boy...was surprised at what a delicious sandwich it was, nothing poor about it! 

Their fries are the best around. Their coleslaw is distinct. Their service is appreciated. I'm looking forward to enjoying more meals here. 

I'm busy and really don't have time to write reviews, but I'll type one up for a local business I want to support! They also use all local AZ grown ingredients folks. 

Don't be intimidated by the humble surroundings from the outdoor seating area. It's comfortable and unpretentious, a sweet little spot to enjoy some real good food."
5,Awesome BBQ! Great price for great food! Best in Madison. I highly recommend the garlic mashed potatoes and sugar fried biscuits! I got the pulled pork and loved the sauce. Sauce was slightly sweet with a great balance of hers and spices. Service was LIGHTNING fast and extremely friendly. I wish we ha this kind of place down in Chicago!
1,"Nuh uh. Nope. No no no. My daughter wanted to eat here for her birthday this year, having eaten at the one downtown successfully 4 years ago. Her birthday, her pick. Plus, she delights in the free mug of soda and balloon. She's a birthday sell-out and I think that must be how they suck you in. 
But, I digress. Our order took an aggravatingly long time to arrive and our glasses remained empty after having drunk their contents while waiting. There was a Packers game on and many of the wait staff were watching that. I don't know if that was the hold up, but it was a bit irritating. 
When our meals finally arrived, my children discovered that the insides of their burgers were very pink. Waaaaay too pink for medium well, which they ordered. It was scary pink and super soft--like raw hamburger generally is. When I told our waiter about it, he was completely uninterested in helping fix the situation, and instead, argued with me about it for quite a while, finally saying, ""That's what medium well looks like"" in a tone that suggested that I was simply too stupid to know the difference. I'm not. Finally I convinced him to humor me and take them back to be cooked through. He did so with a smidgen of contempt.
As a side-note, my husband's burger was to be well done and was also pink, though not raw.
Still no drink refills.
No one offered a discount, a refund, a free soda while we waited, and especially not an apology. Obviously we won't be back."
5,"I only drink their teas and they are fine. The nice aspect of this store is the employees. They make the difference between this coffee shop and other places. Case in point, I was in line when a woman handed the barista a card with her order. The barista read the card, rang her up, took payment, smiled and then gave the hand sign for 'thank you'. Super sweet."
5,My wife and I went here after reading the reviews and were not disappointed. Bethany did our taxes right in front of us within 30 minutes and explained everything clearly and concisely throughout. The rate of $80 was extremely reasonable and actually paid for itself as she found a couple of deductions that I had missed while entering everything in to TurboTax.
1,"I have eaten here many times and have not been impressed with the taste of the food or the prices compared to other places. 

Today we went for lunch. 

My veggie burrito was almost $6 and not very appetizing. 

A co-worker was very disappointed also. She ordered a side salad for $3.99 and what she got was a side of shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, cilantro/onion (which we would have told them to leave off had we known they were going to put it on a salad), cheese, tortilla chips and a packet of ranch.  It seemed like a bunch of toppings thrown together with chips and ranch dressing. 

I would recommend Ranch Market (16th St./Roosevelt), Ritos (14th St/Roosevelt) or Los Charros (10th St/VanBuren) instead."
1,"DIRTY CAR EVEN AFTER MOST EXPENSIVE CARWASH. 

This has happened to me three times there now. Each time, I get a car wash/oil change with the most expensive wash. Each time they leave my cup-holders, parts of windshield, and inside of doors/dash DIRTY... even though I reminded them that I would like them cleaned. This last time, it really looked like they just vacuumed my car. Also, they are really too expensive for what you get. They also get mad/rude if you don't upgrade to all the things they offer you. The sales guy at the beginning got grouchy with me and literally stopped talking to me as soon as I said, ""No thank you"" to a filter change."
5,"Always a family favorite!  Tastes great, cheap, and filling!"
1,"This place has really gone downhill in the last few years. 

When I first moved to the area it seemed like a cool place to go to. Lately the prices for their events have really gone up, the entertainment is trying to be shocking (but lame) and it just is starting to get sticky. The crowd thinks they are artsy but it is more like a half-assed S+M club in someones back yard. 

After going here about 15 times since 2004 I do not think I will go back. 

oh and be careful about where you park. The neighborhood has gotten shady."
5,"My kids and I love this place. We have visited this location three or four times and the Chandler location once. We even turned my mom and stepdad into fans who visit the Chandler location often. We always get great service and tons of food. Tonight was no exception. My son had the Chicken Parmigiana and was extremely happy. My daughter chose the Cheese Mannicotti and Spaghetti, while I had the Meat Lover's plate with 2 huge meatballs and an Italian sausage with spaghetti and meat sauce. We each sampled each others and loved the delicious flavors. We don't get downtown very often, but when we can this is our restaurant of choice."
1,The delived plant bowl did not resemble the picture on the website.  The plants were looking very sickly and it made the arrangement look cheep and unattractive.  I can't believe they would send this out.   It is embarrassing to know that something like that arrived.. looked like a small child put it together.
5,"Ordered online and picked up...20 mins later, I was enjoying deep dish and artisan style pizzas.  Pizzas were great and affordable...will def order again. Glad it's very close to me."
1,"I went in to do some enlarging at 3AM as the FedEx Office is 24 hrs. There were 3 individuals sleeping at the computers and 1 sleeping next to the register. 1 had an IV drug needle on the desk by the computers. I spoke with the FedEx employee who indicated she knew the person and he was diabetic. Now I am sympathetic to both the homeless and handicap but 1) I dont care if he is diabetic and 2) I dont need to see a needle, used or otherwise, on the desk AND 3) the needle was put in a regular garbage can, not a biohazard can like at a hospital. This not only puts workers at risk but is pretty scummy too. The employee seemed to know that these people were sleeping in her store but didnt seem to care when I mentioned it. 

Basically if this is what FedEx Office wants to be known as, a homeless shelter, than fine. But I never associated FedEx with this kind of situation and I am very hesitant to go back or recommend this location to anyone. I could handle the sleeping but the IV needle on the desk was too much."
5,Food was amazing! I don't eat red meat and they made me a special chicken burger with cajun avocado!! So fulfilling!
5,"This historic deli is one of a handful of places Downtown where I've never had a bad experience. The pastrami and corned beef are the best in town and the French fries and chicken noodle soup are brilliant co-stars. 

Downtown Deli is definitely a place to go if you're eating in because the walls are covered with interesting pieces of Phoenix memorabilia and it's always busy at noon, making you feel as though you're smack dab in the middle of a bustling urban environment. 

One tip: You'll want to bank on taking an extended lunch because digesting a Downtown Deli sandwiches is a real chore. Of course I mean that in the very best way."
5,"Out of all the wine bars I've been to in the Phoenix area (not counting Divine Wine in Mesa), this is my favorite! Hands down. The people are friendly, the room is spacious, the wine selection is supple & the atmosphere is cozy. 

The last time I went was after dinner at Panino on Central. My date and I went into the wine bar to sample a selection. He chose his with cheese. I did not. My wine was incredible. We were able to relax on the couch, continue our conversation while having amazing wine at our fingertips. I was giddy with pleasure. 

To top it off, the bathroom is unisex... and sneaky. Behind a wall without a handle, you almost have to tipsily stumble into it to find your way. While waiting for an open room (there are two private bathrooms once you're inside), a couple men profusely apologized. Evidently, they thought they were in the wrong bathroom. Little did they know. 

I would go back here in a heartbeat. In fact, I've been thinking of going soon - it's a perfect place for a date, since there's plenty of room to sit and an atmosphere conducive to conversation. 

Forget Kaz. Try Cheuvoront instead."
1,"From the other descriptions I am reading, I believe our party had the same blond bartender.  Granted she didn't curse out anyone in our party, but it wasn't a very pleasant experience.  It's like she can't be bothered and perform her job in pleasant manner.  Why employ anyone like that?  Last time I checked, restaurants were in the SERVICE industry, so provide better service or customers won't come back."
1,"Called and specifically asked if they could guarantee delivery between specific times on Valentines Day, once assured I placed my order.  15hrs later I get a voicemail asking if I could move the delivery to today and if so they would throw in a box of chocolates free of charge.  After being put on hold for a total of 30min and hung up on twice they finally found my order and assured me that everything would be delivered today.  Well the flowers were delivered today but no chocolates along with misspelled  and misquoted words on the card.  When you charge $15 for delivery I'd expect some level of professionalism. I will NEVER order from here again.  STAY AWAY and order from 1-800-FLOWERS.  I had wanted to support a local business but in this instance I will stick with a national competitor."
1,"I made the mistake of going here on a whim. Awful, shitty bland Mexican food. A waste of money and my butthole was angry with me."
1,"This has to be the most ghetto and disrespectful dive I've ever been to. I usually don't play the race card, but unless you are a Spanish speaking Latino you will not be treated well by the staff.

As soon as I walked up to the counter, a pregnant cashier rolled her eyes and asked dully what I wanted. I couldn't pronounce the name of the combo I wanted but I blurted out the number associated with it and it had a picture. She looked over her shoulder at one of her associates and said something. The only words I caught were ""token gringo customer.""

They shared a giggle.  They were speaking in that half-assed Spanish that has a little English mixed in. Suffice it to say I was offended and promptly cancelled the order. I have not returned since then"
1,"It's so funny...these people take the time to post the menu for each day online...and then don't have it.   We planned all week to eat Osso Bucco on Saturday, and then they don't have it!  Someone forgot to heat it up...that's what they said!   Service?  Ugh.  Food?  How would I know?  they couldn't come up with my entree!

Now we're down to 2699 OTHER Italian restaurants in this town to try..."
1,"I need to order some more contacts, but it seems my prescription only lasted for a year... so I have to get a new eye exam... so I called Central Phx Eye Care, among others.  They want $175 for a contacts eye exam... highest quote I've gotten so far... just an FYI

So I called Target... long story short, they said come right over, an hour later the exam was over, they confirmed my prescription, acted just as professional as any other eyecare facility I've ever been to (and I've been wearing contacts since 1975)... charged me $95... and I can buy my contacts online at half price now.  FWIW, COSTCO was $79 for the same thing, but they didn't have a doctor to give me an exam for another week."
1,Front Desk was rude and not helpful whatsoever. The rooms were small and when we got to our room there was pee in the toilet still. Would choose a different hotel if I was you.
1,"I think Calamari F. pretty much summed it up. OSF serves absolutely inedible ""Italian"" food that is far worse than the usual Americanized Italian fare you get at chain Italian restaurants like Olive Garden. I would have rather had seafood alfredo from Red Lobster. The prices were also very high. The only good thing about our experience was the ""free"" spumoni ice cream that comes with every entree purchase. Avoid at all costs."
5,"I don't know what else I can say that hasn't already been said about Fate, but here goes. 

The food at Fate is like a warm spicy Asian orgasm on a plate. The martinis send me to another level of heaven. Johnny Chu is a genius and  I will cry if he ever leaves Phoenix.

I think that about covers it."
1,Freaking out a little. Just got finished eating there. Hairs in the food and I saw a cockroach crawl across the kitchen floor. At least if I get sick tonight I will know why!
1,We moved to Madison from Ohio and decided to try these guys for our personal tax preparation. They charged more than twice what we have paid in the past and wouldn't file our taxes until they were paid. They did not listen to us and we had to do some of the work ourselves because of this. They do not take the time to go over your return with you and they can't even be bothered to give you a hard copy of your return for your file. We will never return here.
1,"I recently purchased a Group On for a salon pedicure and called to make the appointment which they were booked two weeks out.  I made the appointment and the day before the appointment they contacted me to  tell me that the nail tech that I was scheduled with called in sick.  When I stated that my appointment was for the next day at 11:30 , they indicated that she was going to be out then as well.  Ok, I was fine with this, and they offered to get me in at 2:00 or 3:00.   I indicated that I would have to check my calendar and would call them right back, but she put me in  for 3:00 temporarly.  I called back 10 minutes later to let them know that I could not make 3:00 work due an appointment I had at work and would need to have my pedicure at 2:00.  This was done via voice mail and asked them to call me back to confirm this was still available.  I did not receive a call back, and followed up with a new call to Tangles the following morning, which was the day of my appointment and I left a new voice mail message to confirm that they received my previous voice mail and please call me back.   I did not receive a call, so one would assume that they had me down for 2:00.  I took a late lunch from work, and drove over to their location on Whitney Way which is a good 20 minute drive and when I arrived, was told they had me down for 3:00 and that they were booked and could not get me at 2:00.   At this point I was very frustrated, due to the lack of not responding to my voice mail messages. The receptionist told me she was aware of my calls, but did not have the time to call me back, since they were so busy.    This took an hour of my day, and a gallon of gas to drive there, and  was not offered any  compensation for their lack of not informing me that they were now booked at 2:00, even though I told them I would call right back to confirm either 2:00 or 3:00.      This is the poorest customer service I have ever recieved by far from a salon!!   I wonder how they plan on staying in business, when they treat clients in this matter and have no regard for their time and money, ($3.80 a gallon for gas).  I understand that sometimes it is necessary to adjust an appointment, but the lack of respect for my time is over the top for me.   Also when a salon signs up to offer a Group On deal, I would assume the goal for  doing this is to try and build their business wth new clients.   If they do not have the capablity to handle new clients, then they should not be offering this type of promotion.     Not A New Client!"
5,I grew up on this food. I even worked here at one point in time. This place is amazing. Eat here or else...
1,I dont get how this place has so many great reviews. Customer service was terrible.  I stopped in to discuss a cake for my housewarming.  I arrived about 45 minutes before closing time but felt like i had completely inconvenienced the woman by stepping through the door.  She seemed completely uninterested in listening to my ideas.  I had the distinct feeling that she just wanted me to leave and quit bothering her.  trying to salvation an unpleasant experience i bought a couple of cupcakes to take home.  They certainly didnt make up for rest of it.  Absolutely nothing special.
1,"What an absolute dive, and not in a good way. The day I was so lucky to have gone there was a show of some kind with twinks bouncing all around on the stage with small briefs on, not attractive at all.  Now when entering it be prepared, it reaks of BO, sewer and garbage. I had to push my way through just to get past the entrance, once standing there trying to get my surrounding's, I'm pushed and bumped into as if I am not there. I cannot stand packed places, especially with shirtless, sweaty, smelly guys rubbing into me...yuck. I be-lined it for the patio for escape and stayed there until my friends were ready to leave. Just a awkward mix of very ""interesting ""people, not the most nice to look at, or trust to leave your drink for any amount of time. It's definitely not worth the olfactory assault to ever go in there again."
5,"The Harmony - or the Har Bar as my friends call it, is always an inviting and friendly place to have a beer.  It's a neighborhood bar in the truest sense of the word, locals walk and bike to the place which is situated in one of the greatest areas of Madison.  The food is really nice, an up-scaled bar menu.  The signature dish, the ""Walnut Burger"" is truly fantastic.  Forget about it as a meat-alternative, this burger is a unique creation all its own that will make you have desperate cravings.  The space is large, divided in two, one half the main bar area and the other a large space with family-style tables where groups gather and bands sometimes play at night.  Here you will find the livers of the pure Madison lifestyle celebrating their lives.  These people are happy and they might just make you happy too."
1,Gotta love when you call the office to ask a question and they act like your interrupting their day! Glad we moved out!
5,I go here all the time (about 4 times a month) and i have never had a bad meal or bad service.
5,"We are staying downtown and had decided to go to Sunday Mass in St. Mary's Basilica, one of the oldest churches in Phoenix.  From the outside, it's an mission style stucco exterior, while inside, all the alters are adorned with statues of the saints, and the pipe organ in the upper balcony is absolutely wonderful to hear.  

Mass was very old school in that it was sung from start to finish.  It lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Considering the Church is downtown, there were a large congregation present and not everyone looked like a tourist.  

It's a beautiful old Church worth taking a look at."
5,"I made my first visit here in November 2013. I found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating. I was very happy with my visit with Dr. Mills. I can tell that he thinks critically about all the information I provide, and when he arrives at a recommendation he is very articulate. His approach made me feel comfortable and at ease."
1,"Martin's auto Repair NOT THAT GREAT!

YELP REVIEWS ON MARTIN'S AUTO - SO POSITIVE, 
BUT THAT'S NOT MY EXPERIENCE

 I called Martin's and a guy asked to call me back.  He had time to research my question, what will an oil change cost?  He called me back and said, ""oil change, with oil weight and model specified, $35.  He told me it would take 30-60 minutes and it would cost $35.  But they took two hours and charged ""$55"".  

I won't/can't dispute the very positive reviews, their lengthy history, hell, these are the actual reviews that led me here.  My experience?  I was overcharged by 57%.  FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT!

As I complained, the owner, I assume he was the owner, came out but there was no give: the bill; was the bill. 

Listen, this was a $55 oil change vs the promised $35 oil change.  It was handled.  But I did my research, I called around, I read all the feel-good reviews Martin's had and they still shived me.

MY ADVICE?  BE CAREFUL WITH MARTIN'S.  I DID NOT FIND THEM TO BE THE RELIABLE, LOVABLE NEIGHBORHOOD-AUTOGUYS.  

THEY OVERCHARGED ME AND KEPT ME WAITING."
5,"I bought a Groupon for Blue Fin a couple of years ago and never used it. However on my last trip into the city I decided that I would go and redeem it for the purchased value while I was out that way. Boy am I happy that I did!!

Quite frankly, this place impressed my socks right off. I had heard that it had some good items however I must say that is quite an understatement. Best Teriyaki in the city by far; their panko chicken is also to die for!

Bottom line: I live in south east Gilbert and have driven to eat here 3 times in the last month. Enough said."
5,"Fun place, a lot of different things to see and touch . My two year old daughter had a great time specially in the water playground. 

This is a perfect place to bring your kids in the summer since is indoor and air conditioned."
5,"If you love steak, you'll love Ken's.  I take that back.  If you love meat PERIOD, you'll love Ken's.  They have the best steaks ever, and the chicken breasts are huge.  Their brats are really good, as are the rubbed pork grillers.
They have a variety of other picnic staples like potato salads and macaroni salads and some produce.  Then, add to all that, they have a convenience store attached so you can buy some pop or beer or whatever.

My personal favorites are the burgandy pepper steaks.  It just doesn't get any better."
1,"I'm so sad. this use to be my favorite car wash. Now it is like walking through a prison yard. The people that work there is why I will not be going back. it use to be the best , with the best car wash and service. I wish Sheriff Joe didn't get rid of all their employees and Danny obviously made a deal with Joe on hiring convicts for a tax break. I had scary men hitting on me while I walked in (that work there) and I mind tattoo people but wow. I also don't think my car was clean when I left. I will not be going back , after 10 years. Danny !! come on."
5,"This place has wonderful, doctors, nurses and staff!  This location is one of several offices in the valley that treats high risk pregnancies pre, post and during :)  This practice has been around for 20+ years and has had a great reputation for quailty care for many years."
5,"Totally unpretentious, totally Wisconsin, and totally cheap. I love hanging out here."
5,"I was VERY impressed with this market. The meats look GREAT and their prices are very reasonable!  When you walk in the place your eyes are filled with colorful decorations and sweet treats!  Yes, I said sweet treats.  Their cakes and danishes and other sweet delectables are so colorful it makes you want to buy the whole case full and not eat them....just look at them!    :)  

Frescas?  Yum!  And fresh fish can be fried right on the spot!  I didn't get a chance to try any of the menu but it all looked good while I was there.   

I wish there were Ranch Markets here in Columbus, Ohio!  I'd visit AND patronize often!"
5,"Alice Cooperstown was Great!  Sports theme along with a musician's twist,  Great!!  The sports vibe was fantastic!  Everywhere you look big screens with the game on.  Platinum and Gold records on the walls!  A very festive atmosphere!  The food was very good!  We had the bases loaded Big Unit.  Worth the $!  Very Big, the dog gone thing was Huge!!  The fries were fresh and crispy.  Bottom line, stop here and ENJOY!!!!!"
1,"This place is an embarrassment to mexican restaurants. The food here is terrible! Here's what we ordered:
Combo taco/enchilada / oily taco, diarrhea enchilada 
Green chilie burrito / the tortilla was plastic and the filling was gross.
Taco salad / bunch of stuff with zero taste. Should have grazed in the planter.
The beans and rice? Really? They couldn't even get that right. Under cooked bland rice and under cooked beans.
This place sux!
Beer is good."
5,"Bought three guns from there.  The owner, Trig, probably not a coincidence to trigger, ws very helpful everytime.  Very legit and better prices than the Gander Mountain down the Road.  Would recommend!"
5,I usually have a Teriyaki or sweet and sour chicken bowl.  The price is good and the food is even better.  I've been going to Blue Fin since 2005.  The personable and quick customer service makes the experience all the better.  It's easily accessible by the lightrail and north from the Central Library.  Love this place.
1,"I am sorry to have to write a review like this for a local restaurant.  I am vegan.  I had a lunch reservation for Coronado Cafe, but decided to call ahead of time to work out any kinks in the preparation (e.g., no butter, no refined sugar, no smuggled in eggs or milk or cheese).  When I called, I thought I was lucky to have reached the owner.  I was quickly disabused.  She quipped that I should have taken the time to look up their menu online.  (By the way, of course I had, but they don't label!)  When I told her that the menu doesn't tell me everything I need to know for my diet (e.g., the butter or sugar issue), she got really exasperated and whined, ""I'm trying to help you.""  I said that was great and I'd like the help.  She then said that they have several vegetarian items, which again I explained might not be vegan (a vegan diet is more restrictive, so just because it's vegetarian does not necessarily mean it's vegan).  I asked her, for example, to ask the chef if the veggie burger was vegan, and she said,  ""I'm the owner and I know everything about the menu.""  So I asked her if the veggie burger was vegan and she said, ""I don't know.  Is a veggie burger vegan?""  I said, ""Some are; some aren't.""  She said, ""I don't think this is a place for you.  Don't come.""  I didn't.  And I won't ever.  

To sum up:  The owner is rude, unhelpful, unknowledgeable about food -- and to top it all off, she refuses to talk to the chef (who could easily answer food prep questions).  Two thumbs down; two thumbs way down."
5,"There will be a wait at Pizza Bianco, and I mean a wait... and yes, it is worth it! So go here for drinks as you to prepare for a pizza masterpiece... Bar Bianco. 

It's right next door across the lawn like the perfect neighbor we all wish we had. A chill and relaxing place, like having beer and wine at a good friend's quaint and warm house equipped with a fireplace, paintings, hardwood floors, dim lighting and great music! It definitely will help pass the hours you could wait for the pizza (pizza that I would book a flight to Phoenix for). Just make your night about the complete experience and throw all caution about time out the window of Bar Bianca! 

Just writing about this has me checking flight times!"
5,"BUCKS is hands down the most delectable addictive amazingly priced pizza anywhere!!  Once you try this perfect thin crust wonder, you will be hooked. There are simply no negatives i can say except i wish there were more locations.  Absolute sheer perfection. trust me."
5,"Sure, you could e-file but then you'd miss out on the pleasant banter and helpful advice I picked up from Duane.  

Reasonable rates that clearly pay for themselves.  Even with my simple filings, he found some things I had missed that bumped up my refund.  Did an even better job with Kate and her new business enterprise.

While not glamorous, it was a pretty excellent way to spend $65."
5,"I'm from out of town and was looking for a place to have some beer and some good food and this place was excellent.  First of all, the waitress was very kind with great service and helpful advice for a couple ""newbies"".  The beer selection was great and we got a pitcher of a microbrew for $10, which I thought was a great price.  The burgers were huge and very tasty along with the cheesecurds and fries.  I will definitely visit this place again next time we're in town."
1,"I am officially boycotting this joint.  I have been shopping here for over 15 years. It was a really cool re-sale store where you good find some nice pieces for a decent price. They now have thrift store quality clothes at retail prices. My last few times in there I spent an hour or so shopping and left empty handed, waste of time, the only decent things I found were way over priced. They need to hire buyers with a better fashion sense, and that don't all look and dress the same."
1,"Stayed at the Biltmore and went here because of an American Express dining certificate.  The experience: a dirty soup spoon, sending back the soup, taking a bite of scallop that made me sick, and terminating the dining experience as a result ... If I could give ""negative stars,"" I would.  This is a nasty, as in dirty-ass nasty, restaurant pretending to be fine dining."
1,"A WRAITH OF AMERICANA LONG UNDEAD, CHURNING OUT CACA AT OUTRAGEOUS PRICES

--$3.50 slice of ham
--$4.00 glass of concentrated OJ
--3am best time to visit; you're going to be sick in an hour anyway from the booze you drank earlier. 
--no ""honey""-calling, gum-chewing flos anywhere to be seen
--only the blur-in-motion Mexican-girl dishwasher/busers who can clear a table in 3.8 seconds
--24-7 operation means this place never gets a deep clean and it shows
--bathroom towels NEVER stocked
--window blinds caked in mud
--buser station crusty with layers of splattered milk and grease

And the food is atrocious. 
Not even grilled cheese makes it past the gag reflex

Get me outa here!!!"
1,"I shop here because, it is the only place to get what I need in biking distance.  9 out of 10 times,  I am overcharged.  On my last 2 visits it was for over $4.  I make it a habit to go over my receipt, near customer service to collect my inevitable refund."
5,"Totally AMAZING pet supply! Wholesale prices to the public and super friendly staff! It's a bit overwhelming the first time you go so expect to spend some time there - you can call to request a catalog or go online to price items since the items in the warehouse are not priced (and yes, they accept credit cards). They are always busy so many times items are missing but they are constantly restocking the shelves. I priced the same items at Petsmart for $220, on Amazon for $125, and paid $85 at Ryan's."
5,"I loved this place. I went alone one day while doing some house searching in downtown Phoenix. I just picked this place randomly not knowing it'd be so yummy! I ordered the salad with chicken, strawberries and panko-crusted goat cheese. It was SO delicious! I ate every bit of it. The chicken was so tender and moist...and sometimes grilled chicken can be quite dry. Not here. The portion size was more than enough for me and the service was great. It was a such a lovely day to boot. I definitely will go back."
5,"I love the Coronado Cafe.  They offer fresh ingredients and a seasonal menu.  The service is phenomenal.  I was but a lonely two top in a sea of large parties, but was paid attention to nonetheless.  My buddy and I made many substitutions and our order came out perfectly; our check was below forty dollars, cocktails included.  I wish I lived closer by because I'd be there every Saturday when I wake up in dire need of eggs and cocktails."
5,"Best TexMex in the valley! The chips and salsa are home made and probably the best I have ever eaten. I had shrimp tacos which were delicious, staff was very friendly and down to earth.....if you ate downtown give them a try."
5,"Another fun wine tasting in the books! The fella that hosted the Arizona Strongold wine tasting was awesome and we want to thank Todd for selecting some fantastic cheeses for us. The tapas plate was pork belly and blue cheese stuffed dates....incredible!  If you haven't tried a wine tasting here yet, put it n your to do list!"
5,"FABULOUS ! 
When i lived in Phx i craved a cheese steak having had some of the best this one is great  . This area is a mixed bag of nuts & NEVER thought I would find this winner in the SW. I miss this area if i ever get back I will be getting a cheesesteak from here ."
1,"I won't be returning. Today, I picked up an order for my friend and I. They read back the order and it was exactly what it should be, but when I got to work, they had not put a rice krispie bar in even though they charged us for it. Additionally, my Japanese Pan noodle bowl left much to be desired. The carrots were uncooked (even though they were supposed to be) and ""topped with cilantro"" means one slimy spring of cilantro with 2 leaves on it. My friend's pasta was burnt. Burnt! While I like Noodles & Company in general, this location is lacking."
1,"the worst hotel ever!!!! warning do not stay here!!!!! moldy sheets , stained sheets, tub felt like water under the plaster! carpet is sickning sheets had hair all over it....crumbs and rubbish pushed on the side of the night stand...we made them change our sheets at 11 o'clock at night and they were all huffy.just filthy......department of health needs to go in their!!!!! if u want to see pictures email me at cnjvape@gmail.com and on the subject line put days inn pictures. i be more than happy to send u photos...its not worth saving money on your trip i am dead serious. i regret stay ing their just to save money , now i have some insect bite on my wrist that is swollen and red....warning!!!!!! if u do belive me i will email u the pictures......"
5,"So much yes. 

I've been here 3 times now, and every time was awesome. The food is bomb, I've had the little birdy (chicken & cheddar cheese on a biscuit), the grilled cheese, & some sort of fries with cole slaw & other delicious stuff on top. Never disappoints. The service is super friendly & the owner came to check up on us & make us feel welcome, always a plus.

The atmosphere is great, super laid back & everyone is friendly. Makes you feel like you have nothing better to do than eat delicious food & drink yummy hurricanes and hang out. 

Yeah, the hurricanes... Get one. So tasty. And I don't even like rum... Or pineapple. 

Enough said, I think I'm a new regular."
5,"Always passed it,but finally stopped,worth it,super traditional sonoran dishes, good service,cold beer,I got the #6 a chicken flauta and taco,the flauta was basically a big rolled taco,I was hoping for the real deal,the did have the best salsa versa I ever had,and im not lying,served hot.go there."
1,"Worst Indian in the entire phoenix valley, the lunch buffet had only one chicken dish, one meat, one daal, one vegetable, are you kidding me and nothing was exceptional, it was just average. Not at all good and value for money, Compare the menu with Chutneys on baseline and Ray.

I will never come back again."
1,I hate you.
5,"After finding Ryan's on yelp I decided to check it out.  First off I was a little thrown off at walking through the warehouse but they have super helpful and friendly staff!  I FINALLY found a leash a collar set I adore and at $15 (after tax) for them you can't beat it!  I scored a great collection of new toys, an AWESOME set of nail clippers and a very useful travel dog water/food dish all for $38!

I will be making trips there regularly."
5,"If you don't like La Tolteca, just go to Taco Bell for the rest of your life, because you obviously don't enjoy food. Your eating privileges should be revoked, in fact. 
 THIS IS MY FAVORITE Mexican place in the ENTIRE COUNTRY, and if you look through my reviews, it's quite obvious that Mexican food is my #1 reason to live. The menu selection is HUGE. My favorites are: The Shrimp Tacos.. SO GOOD. Big hot corn tortillas, with gigantic grilled spicy shrimp, red & green bell pepper, and onions. Their Chile Rellenos are simply the best I've ever had.. They are egg dipped, stuffed with perfectly melted cheese, and the peppers are huge, spicy and ROASTED. *dies* YES. None of that soggy baby food tasting relleno you may find elsewhere. This is the real deal! Papas taco is great, Elotes are awesome, etc etc.. The only let down has been the Fish taco.. it's just kinda dull.. but why eat that when there are the OMFG FALL OVER SO GOOD shrimp tacos. Also the environment is unique, festive, and cheery, and the staff are great too.. the owner is a doll.. I just love her :D Before I forget.. THE SALSA BAR.. Absolutely the best salsa in Phoenix, and if you can't deal with heat, then go cry about it somewhere else.. There are several types and styles ranging from mild to BURN YER TONGUE OFF, and there are also roasted chiles and that marinated trio of carrots, cauliflour and something else I can't remember right now :P  I'm not even going to start about the desserts, cuz they speak for themselves.."
5,"I love this place!

My son and I were driving back from the Wisconsin Dells and decided to pull off for lunch and we found Fat Jacks on my GPS.

The outside of the place isn't very impressive, but some of the best bbq places I've ever been to have been dumps.  The inside is much nicer, decorated with local Wisconsin artifacts and pictures.  My favorite was the old beer bottle collection by the entrance.

Anyway, we got sat and our waitress came over right away....super friendly and super nice lady.  We asked for a recommendation and she basically went over the whole menu and said everything was great, and after eating there, I believe her.

I ordered the pulled pork lunch and my son got the fish fry.  When she brought over the plates, I knew we were in trouble...there was sooo much food! 

My son's fish was very good, not greasy but light and flaky.  My pork was excellent.  The waitress asked if we wanted a hotter bbq sauce, I love spicy, so she brought it.  Excellent!  Smokey, spicy flavor.  The sauces on the table were really good too.

If you are looking for some good, casual, non-pretentious BBQ, Fat Jack's is the place for you!  Don't let the outside fool you, the inside is clean and the food is excellent and they give you a ton of it!"
1,"I hate Fate!  

My fate at Fate has always been to have a mediocre meal that takes too long.  Don't even bother with a group as it only makes the servers even more surly than normal and the food even slower to arrive.

The last time I was there, I was with a group (bad idea, per my comment above).  Several folks asked that their food be prepared mild.  When the food came, every dish on the table was nuclear hot.  I can handle hot food, but this was on par with Los Dos Molinos.  When we mentioned this to our server, she told us that it all has to do with the peppers they have on hand at any given time.  She patiently explained that the heat levels of the peppers vary (Duh!), but the chef always uses the same amount of pepper and never tastes the food.  Therefore, the heat level varies wildly and there is no consistency.  Frankly, any chef who doesn't taste their food needs to get out of the kitchen and into another line of work.

The concept of the menu with the various preparations and the choice of proteins is great.  Sadly, Fate falls apart in its execution.

It's a lot less flashy, but you get a consistent meal at China Chili where they also know how to regulate the heat in their food.  Apparently their chefs actually taste their dishes."
1,"The only good part of this place was the welcoming hostess. after the waiting staff and managerial staff, the waitresses were horrible. I felt disrespected and unwelcomed once I entered the door. Managers were very disgruntled and unhelpful... Anissa and Amy's skills should be in question. As a military service member I have never felt more disrespected when visiting an establishment. I will never talk positive about this bar and grill."
5,"Most of my reviews for Asian restaurants in Phoenix begin with something like, ""it's good...for the area,"" but this place is just plain good. I'm a pretty serious Thai food snob and--even when I lived in Chicago--I only frequented a handful of Thai places.
That being said, I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer at Wild Thaiger.

My husband and I gave it a try for Dining out for Life when our first choice had a long wait. I've never been so happy I couldn't get a table somewhere. 

We sat outside on their patio which I would recommend to anyone. It's open yet cozy and comfortably cool. 

For our appetizer, we had the seafood pancake. I've never had anything like it but the description sounded too good to pass up. It's a crispy pancake full of sprouts, scallions, shrimp, mussels and squid. It was delicious and really unique. 

For dinner, I ordered the Decha Boar. The description listed it as being perfect for the ""true Thai foodie."" With a description like that, I had to order it. The dish was spicy and flavorful. I'd caution anyone not familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods. Different chiles effect people differently. My husband ordered the Ginger Fish. The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack. I could've taken a bath in it. Long story short: it was SO good. 

I'll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items. They have a smaller menu compared to most Thai places and I believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre things with Thai flavors. Check this place out!"
5,"This restaurant is a perfect example of why I give my money to local business owners.

This is a sparsely decorated gem in Midtown Phoenix. In an area full of lunch only, counter order spaces, one would think this wouldn't be welcome. I love a rice bowl every now and then and this one is extremely high quality and stocks every type of rice bowl imaginable. I've had the Oyako and Teriyaki both multiple times and they are delcious. You definitely wait a few minutes for your food, and that is a good thing because it means they are not mass producing food and waiting for people to order it, like Tokyo Express does. 

Good food alone though, won't garner a five-star review for a rice bowl. What pushes Blue Fin over the top is the ownership. The little old Japanese lady who owns and runs the restaurant during lunch time is one of the absolute nicest people I've ever encountered. She welcomes every customer, and speaks to you in a genuine family like manner. She does not come across as fake or ass-kissish. I just get a calm, warm, and welcome feeling from this woman when I come in here.  It's not even just her either. Her staff always looks happy, and has run of the soda fountain, water, lemonade, etc. Everyone just seems to be happy. It's true that if you take care of your staff, they make your customers happy as well.

Many other places make me feel so unwelcome around here at lunch time, but I can always count on Blue Fin to treat me like family and give me a solid rice bowl."
1,"omg. sitting in the bar because they had no seating in main diningroom.  menus flung onto the table, no greeting from server. when i mentioned it to the server. she gets an attitude. food comes out, cold and unappetizing.... having to listen to a guy at the next table scream, use the f bomb every other sentence.
manager did bring our hot food out personally so we got to talk. this is not the place i remember to come and dine and enjoy........"
1,"I will never do business with any Half Price Books store again after my experiences with the staff at this store. I have been here multiple times and have yet to find someone who is polite or pleasant to talk to. When I asked for help trying to find the cooking section I was told ""Why don't you just read the signs?"" I tried to sell a nonfiction manual and was told it was out of date even though it was the most current edition available. When I tried to protest the woman at the counter told me she ""clearly knows more about this"" than I do. I came back a few weeks later to sell another manual that had ICDM on the front and the girl actually tried to tell me that meant there was a CD that was supposed to go with it. I tried one more time to sell some novels and after the clerk gave me a pay slip he threw my book in the garbage right in front of me. I also tried to sell a like new condition $30.00 novel only to be offered a dollar for it. I asked why and was told ""it's a short book."" I have never encountered anyone here who didn't make it very obvious that it is a waste of their time to serve customers. Even when I greet them with a smile and say ""excuse me, could you help me find something?"" They still give me attitude and act as though I am just in their way. It is very clear to me that the people here believe that it would be so much easier to do their job if those damn customers would just stay out of their way. I have already ordered my kindle and whatever books I have left are going to goodwill (which is just around the corner from this store.) I would rather give my books away for free than have an illiterate, incompetent and grossly uneducated person attempt to determine the value of a book they are unable to appreciate."
5,"I've had my car washed at Los Olivos for a few years now and I'm not sure why I've waited to write a great review about them.  They are one of the few HAND car washes in the valley.  I have other car washes much closer to where I live but I will drive out of my way to have my car washed here because I will pass on the flinging rocks stuck in car wash tracks and a sub-par wash from other locations. Listen, my car is not new but I plan on keeping it awhile so I need it to always look like new and avoid dings in my paint or windows.

Bottom line is, you will receive quick wonderful customer service, a detailed wash at a great price...plus they have a punch card which I really appreciate.  Who doesn't want something free at a place you frequent? I also get my mats washed and had to get my head light covers cleared and they did it very well, quickly and again at a great price.  

You should visit!"
5,They do a great job.
1,"I had to go here as a kid. I was busted shoplifting and sent here for a day. It was crazy, I met a guy from my highschool there and we are best-o-friends still. (15yrs later) We were the only ones there that were not drunk, loaded, or in trouble for beating someone up til near death."
5,"I stopped by after visiting my mom in the hospital. It was cold and raining, and I needed comfort food. I knew I had heard of this place but could not recall any reviews specifically. 

As I walked in from the parking area, I laughed and wondered if the side entrance was actually the front door? THAT is how it was back in Michigan, only salesmen used the front. 

I walked in and was greeted by the guy behind the bar. Then greeted by a waiter. They seemed really nice and inviting but the vibe was way off from what I expected. There was no old lady to greet me or ask how my day was. It was a beautiful decor sort of modern and not a cafe at all. I still loved it though. 

I ordered the sliders which really should not be called sliders. They were the best mini burgers I have ever had and I love a burger. They were 1/2 inch thick, with caramelized  onion and some fancy blue cheese. They were served with mac n cheese too. 

I will be back to try the regular burger but if you go for happy hour the sliders are only 7 bucks or so."
1,"Welcome to my exclusive 1-star club, Mr. Roberts.

I went here to see a friend's band play, despite my boyfriend's warning that it was not the greatest bar.  I do so love dive bars--how bad could it be?

Bad.  It's so bad.  It's past the stage of being a fun dive bar, it's just plain frightening.  The people looked like the kind of scary, angry drunks you would only encounter in a movie.  The bathroom stall was so little that had I weighed 20 pounds more, I probably would have gotten wedged in (the door opened inward, not outward).

We did not stay long, I did not regret it, and won't be back.  Ick, yuck, blech, and ptooey.  Why would anyone think this is a good place?!"
1,"I am so confused by all of the ratings. I've tried this place twice now hoping that things would be better and that I just ordered the wrong items but I was, yet again, very disappointed. The only thing this place has going for itself is that they have large portions.

As for the food, it should be called Tex""ass"" Grill!

First time I visited, my boyfriend and I ordered the ribs meal. The ribs were dry and extremely salty. The sides weren't any better either. Their potatoes were bland and coleslaw was over-dressed. 

Seeing the highly rated reviews on their Chicken Fried Steak, I hoped my most recent visit would bring redemption to this restaurant, but, boy was I wrong!

Their Chicken Fried Steak was bland as was their gravy and mashed potatoes! They didn't bother to season the meat and it seems like it was just dredged in season-less flour batter. The gravy was flavorless as well. 

I really wanted to like it but my taste buds fought against me. I felt dirty trying to take another bite because I kept trying to fool myself into thinking I tasted the meat... or the batter... or the gravy... or the potatoes. My last bite of redemption... the biscuit.... which was also flavorless! What happened to buttery, flaky biscuits? They would be well inclined to consult the Pillsbury Dough Boy for some pointers because those taste 100% better.

Disappointment and empty stomachs filled my household for the rest of the evening. At least something was full."
1,"COBBLER FRAUD. Ok, your calling yourself a Cobbler shop (and who does that), yet your admitting to me that your peaches are not fresh, but ""hey it tastes like it does huh"".  I'm glad that I just asked for a taste of the cobbler to avoid getting more riled up and then luckily asked the nice lady about her peaches. How cheap are some places and then it was obvious the sample had been nuked because it was microwave hot and not fresh out of the oven. Then I'm thinking, hmmm I never had a frozen apple before, the apple cobbler must be fresh right - apples are like 10 cents each. But to my horror, those apples are also canned, frozen or otherwise not fresh. All of this could have been avoided if I never stepped foot in the place and just stared at the sign. Karim doesn't make cobbler, Grandma does, Karim just thinks he can call himself whatever he wants - oh its cobbler allright, but granny would be rolling over in her grave at these frozen, canned and nuked frauds."
5,"So I have this terrible addiction. Every time I go anywhere near downtown, I have to go to Zoe's. 
I LOVE their limeade and have often wished I could just order the whole pitcher and leave the place with it. 
I'm a big fan of the chicken pita with loads of Feta, caramelized onions and chicken. 
I know I should probably branch out and try something new, but nothing beats the limeade and chicken pita with pasta salad. 
Oh, and don't even get me started on the chocolate cake!"
1,"I have to search long and hard for things in this store that don't expire the day I'm purchasing them. They don't have a lot of the things they offer in their weekly ad, which I try to plan my grocery list around. The lines are always SUPER long. The store is always dirty. I keep telling myself I'll go to another store but there isn't another one in the 'hood to go to, so I'll need to make a better plan to head further away for a better experience in another chain. I've tried to talk to assistant managers about my issues at the store and have been blown off or they act afraid and stutter a lot. 

The only good news: The gentlemen that bag groceries and collect carts are VERY nice and helpful."
5,"Yeah, for realz... all the awards, accolades, etc., are spot on. Best ribs I can remember having in a very, very, very long time - perhaps ever. I especially liked the end portions of the slab that somehow dodged the sauce and were on the  tougher side (think jerky). That alone was fantastic. Unfortunately, much like the Cookie Monster now says that cookies are sometimes food, these delicious ribs are sometimes food too. Every now and then though, I might have my Cookie Monster moment where sometimes is NOW!"
5,"Once again ... the negative reviews by fellow yelpers ... can be so lame. Talk about first world problems, here. 

News flash: mexican food can be very unhealthy. Especially tortilla chips that arrive to the table so piping hot that you have to wait for them to cool down before indulging. Salty, spicy hot, warm, crunch.

The molé here is the only one that is as delicious as my mom's mole. Seriously that good. The margaritas are stiff and delish. This place is here for the food, not the service ... though the service has always been great.  

This restaurant is one of the best of it's kind. Major bonus: if you want to hear music, play it on the jukebox. Totally off the wall eclectic selection, gotta love it."
5,"I always come here, the owner is very friendly and works really hard to keep a satisfied customer. Great deals and great washes. I can't wash the car this good myself! 
Highly recommend"
5,"This is what I love about Phoenix, you find these little treasures where you expect them the least!

Loved everything about the place. We had a team dinner in one of the rooms and it really felt like we were having dinner in someone's dining room. Super cute atmosphere, loved the pictures from all over Europe. I has the vegetarian rellenos (sp?) and my mouth is still watering just thinking about it. 

We also had the only malbec they have by the bottle and it was delicious!!"
5,"Go Suns!

US Airways has always been a fantastic venue. I have seen concerts and Suns games here. On my most recent visit I attended the Suns/76ers game.On this particular trip the tickets we had enabled us to eat/drink in Blue Moon Lounge which was fun.

It really doesn't matter where you sit as there are a lot of choices for concessions and  the seats are comfortable. Considering the crowd size there is never an overwhelming wait for the ladies room. As others have mentioned, there is no shortage of night life downtown after a game or concert at US airways."
1,"I was raised in Miami with a Cuban mother so I think I have enough grounds to say that if you are looking for good Cuban food...this is not the place.  The food was tasteless, not authentic and way over priced. 3 croquetas (tiny ones and def not Cuabn) were $5.50  Dinner was $63 for my wife and I. we left hungry and dissapointed. :("
5,"Eclectic (but down-to-earth), Upbeat, Friendly, Inexpensive, Near-healthy (see menu), Kid-friendly, Fast, Clean, Variety.

What more could one ask for?"
1,"WOW! That is the first word that comes to mind. I called to make a lunch business meeting reservation and you'd thought I was asking them to sponsor the lunch! I was told that they really don't like business meetings taking place because of shift change and how long they take. I reacted with asking him if I should seek another restaurant to make my reservation that can accommodate the meeting. He rebutted with ""well I have your name down"" and then click. This bothered me so I called back to cancel my lunch meeting with the manager. After being ""disconnected"" once I was finally able to share my story and cancel my reservation with the manager. The manager was really nice though. Yikes, this is not customer service of any kind. It's sad because I really wanted to try something new (sad face)!"
1,"I should have read the reviews Before taking in because they totally Suck!! It's about as clean on the outside as a drive thru car wash and as far as the inside is concerned, well they did not even touch the middle console and they barely got the dust of the dash.  
Now as for those gnat like windshield guys , if I say no then listen to me and if you don't then I should be able to spray you with the liquid of my choice like a cat. 
I'm over this place. Never Again!!"
5,"Loved. Super duper friendly service. The bumble bee was delicious and filling. Chicken was juicy and flavorful. They made me a margarita even though not on the menu. The boyfriend was very pleased they played the pixies. Casual, neighborhood vibe."
1,Avoid avoid avoid. What is this place Japanese? Italian? Do they know who they are? We ordered seaweed salad - I think my frys has better salad for $2; my daughter ordered California rolls - very average; the pad Thai was as bland as I have ever had and the calamari was over fried and zero flavor - no wonder they offer  sauce. Kids liked the cinnamon flavored bread so that accounts for one star.
1,"I love pita, hummus, Mediterranean food and was anxious to try this place. What a huge disappointment. Dressing was over spiced, just burned. Pita was bland. 

Glad to see stable something in Town & Country."
5,"Well to tell you every time I come here is amazingly awesome, never had a problem with there food or service. People just need to chill with the bad reviews.

Also not just the food is great but their deserts are delicious! Mango with white rice and cream is a must try!"
1,"If a restaurant wants to be reviewed on more than the quality of its bathroom, its food shouldn't keep the entire party imprisoned there.

Despite wonderful service, a good price ($10 for dinner), a lot of premium dishes, and fresh sushi, the overall experience was awful. There weren't any standouts among the dishes- most everything was pretty generic. My whole table took turns rotating through the disgusting bathroom... somehow, we were able to time our vomiting. In retrospect, it's kinda impressive.

I think the biggest problem was that the food was kept at room temperature. As others mentioned, the chef spent a lot of time checking on the dishes, but he didn't seem to notice that everything was tepid. 

The food also ruined the after-dinner movie, which effectively doubled the cost of our loss."
5,"This was our first B&B expierence and it was amazing! We stayed here June 2012 for a birthday weekend. The owners made us feel very special and right at home. Our room, the Madison Lakes Room, was huge and the bathroom was spectacular. I loved the steam shower! The property is large and a great place to take a walk during the day. They are also lots of outdoor seating areas to sit and enjoy the scenery or read a book. The breakfast was great, I think we had 3 courses a day of food. Pat makes a great breakfast and Bob provides good company during the meal. Their dog Happy is also a companion while you eat or walk the property.

 They do also have snacks in the lounge area for you to enjoy at anytime. There are sodas in the fridge and sometimes fresh baked cookies!"
1,last ditch Christmas eve take home pizza...ok...I ordered it on line and went and picked it up..they kept me waiting anyway...I asked for extra crisp...might as well have asked for extra raw...just to much dough..ingredients just laid on top of mushy dough...flavors..so so...would never go there again thanks....
5,"Amazing, been twice and would go every week if I lived downtown. The food is incredible, the environment is chill, and the proprietors are super friendly. It's only open Sun.-Tuesday and will close for good 4th of July. Go while you can!!"
1,"Unfortunately, yesterday's visit was one of the worst dining experiences I've had during my 10 years in Phoenix. The food was sub-awful (seriously, a cheese crisp that a 7-year-old deems inedible?), the service was terrible (zero smiles, and I had to basically tackle our server get the check, much less some refills on water glasses), and the atmosphere was equal to that of the third lunch shift at a nursing home.

I won't go back. Ever."
1,"I hate giving 1-star reviews, but I'm not sure how else to rate the overall experience.

The Atlas Court location appears to be quite aged, extremely cramped, and lacks quality customer service. They do have a ton of equipment available, but that's about it.

I arrived on Saturday morning with my reservation for a 17' truck firmly in-hand. There was a line of people waiting to check-in/check-out equipment, and only one person working behind the counter. 

The employee (a younger gentleman) appeared to be struggling with everything he did, and he wasn't shy about hiding his frustrations. After waiting for around 15 minutes, another employee (I believe he's the manager) jumped-in and helped folks. The manager was much more proficient, helpful, and friendly. I was third or fourth in line, and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer.

When I went to get my truck, there was an equipment problem, so they substituted another truck for me. Unfortunately, the truck that I was provided was ancient - it had 204,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, and it ran so poorly that I thought I was going to breakdown at several points along the way. The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time; I could ""saw"" the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my direction/course.

Because of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.

Even more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas. 

Returning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was ""f-ing out of here"" because he had ""the longest f-ing day of his life"" working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation. 

I now remember why I've always used Penske or Budget when moving. It's unlikely I'll use these guys in the future..."
5,"Called in another order earlier this week. It was ready when I got there. As always, the food was amazing. I'm still trying to figure out how they have beef of such incredible quality. They cook it perfectly. Just awesome. One nitpick- dinner costs more than lunch but you don't get a spring roll with it? Come onnnnn! Just throw one in the bag. I won't tell!"
5,"The bar is now called Slice's. Bullit is gone (thank god). Great friendly service, great food and the owner is cute as a button. Justin no longer works there but Kimmy and Brian will treat you right. There mixology is beyond reproach. Great fish fry and even better burgers."
1,"One of the rare times I indulge in restaurant food is for breakfast, and I wanted to try Taco Bell's new breakfast menu. I pulled into the drive-thru at 7:20 a.m., and all the inside and outside lights were on, including the drive-thru menu's, but the only person working was the guy power-washing the sidewalks--nobody home even though there were signs everywhere advertising that the place was now open for breakfast! I headed to my office dejectedly and checked the website to find out this location doesn't open until 9 a.m. If you're going to serve a breakfast menu, please keep breakfast hours that suit the average commuting breakfast eater, especially when you're competing with a dozen other fast food joints in a half-mile radius who are all also serving breakfast but open at 6 if they're not already open 24 hours. I have had other stuff from here since I've worked and lived nearby for the past 10 years, and it's otherwise decent service and passable fast food, but with so many other affordable and decent Mexican joints around with drive-thru windows, this isn't worth it for lunch or dinner, either, unless you're in a real time crunch."
5,Best Sports bar in downtown by a mile. If you are lucky you might even get to meet Alice. The big unit is an amazing dog. As for the rest of the food I have never had anything bad and I have been going since it opened back in the day. Also a fun place to watch a show.
1,"I went in a few weeks ago. I reached into the car when they were done and the cash in my ashtray had been stolen. This is funny only because I was going to give it to them anyway. When I told the Manager, he told me that it had been happening recently and that he would look into it. I never heard anything back. 

I went in again today and when I didn't tip as quickly as they had liked, the staff told me how rude I was for not tipping. 

Car wash is is mediocre on  a good day, but convenient location for me. Too bad the management can't manage the staff. It is a case of the inmates running the prison, if you know what I mean."
5,"Good Thai food is hard to find.

You've found it here!

I went here for lunch today and was blown away. I feel like I've been to so many places around the valley and just haven't found one that I like. I found this place on a whim and decided to try it out. I'm vegan so it's hard for me to find places where I can eat anything. This place had multiple options and everything I tasted was good. I had the Tofu Veggie Pansang. It was delightfully spicy and the tofu was cooked perfectly. My friend had the pad thai and was equally as impressed.

They had good lunch specials and delicious Iced Tea.

I will be going back here again."
1,"I came here hankering for a real deli experience (e.g. chompies/ east coast style), but I was willing to settle for just a decent sandwich.   I ordered a turkey sandwich and got dry bird on a tasteless, tacky bun that induced grade school cafeteria flashbacks. I consoled myself with the fact that I at least had a pickle to munch on.  but alas! I bit into a revoltingly limp, fetid-smelling, gag-inducing gherkin not fit for consumption.   I had to spit it out in my napkin like some priss---a sorry thing for a woman who likes to chow down.   well at least I had some water....

my advice: go an extra mile to steer clear of this glorified cafeteria."
1,"What is the hubub over China Chili?!?! Don't understand the high rating this restaurant is getting?!?

I had not been back to this area for 5+ years and wanted to stay near downtown Phoenix where my friend lives. I looked up high-rated Chinese restaurants in downtown Phoenix and China Chili, of course, came out on top. Well folks, you yelpers here are totally fooled!

First of all when you sit down, the menu gives the impression that this restaurant is a Szechaun or Hunan restaurant. It's NOT! The chefs at this restaurant are Cantonese serving Szechaun and Hunan dishes.

For starters, my friend and I ordered Sizzling Rice Soup. As entrees, we ordered Szechaun Shrimp and Braised Tofu with Beef. I had a hint of what was to come by listening to the waitresses... Surprise! They all were speaking in Cantonese!

The Sizzling Rice Soup was very good. 

The Szechaun Shrimp turned out to be a Sweet and Sour dish...  Shocking! There are almost NO dishes in Szechaun cooking that are Sweet and Sour! It looked nice though, the shrimp was ringed around the plate by thin slices of cucumber. The Braised Tofu with Beef was almost as bad, chemically tenderized beef that probably is used from another dish and dropped in the Braised Tofu. Both dishes were supposed to be HOT... NOT!

The only redeeming thing we got out of this adventure was that our wallets were not affected that much by the experience!

Demographics of Customers @ 6pm - less than 5% Oriental, 40% of capacity.

If you want an authentic Szechaun restaurant, travel down to Tempe to Wong's Place on Baseline Road off of I-60. I will be going there tomorrow night and writing a review which will be more positive than this one!"
5,"We had a wonderful experience at Louisianne's. We had reservations for dinner, but happened to be seated next to a rather loud group of men. Since the restaurant was completely full, we asked if we might be able to be seated in the bar area instead (which was much quieter). They quickly accomodated our request and we had an enjoyable conversation throughout dinner. The food was excellent and a musician softly played piano in the background. The service was prompt, helpful, and friendly. Terrific night out!"
1,This is just very bad bbq and poor service.   I have given it several chances and nothing has changed.   Will not be going back.
1,This place has gone down hill. What used to be in the normal exhibits are now in a paid exhibit hall. It's sad that they have resorted to that to make money. I won't be renewing my membership.
1,"I have always loved this place BUT the last 3 times I have visited I have had TERRIBLE service and last night was the icing on the cake!!!!

Last night (Thursday) we arrived at 10:20 pm for a late dinner after a show. Since they were supposed to close at 11:00 pm we figured it was enough time to eat. When we walked in there were only three other tables of people, one of which was a couple that came in right before us. We waited at the host stand for 3 minutes and finally were greeted by the bartender. He took us to our table and told us our waitress would be with us shortly.  

The only server left (female, dark brown hair) came over and rushed her greeting by acting annoyed that we were there. She took our order and ran off to start doing the close prep. 5 minutes later she came back to our table and said that the bar was closing (10:30 pm) and that we couldn't get frozen drinks. She asked if we were interested in ordering another type of drink but we declined. She then acted annoyed that we didn't want something other than water! 

Our food quickly came out and it was WONDERFUL (thankfully) but our waitress never came back to check on us. I ran out of water and just as I was putting my napkin down she came over with another glass. At that time we asked for our check. We were so mad about the quality of the service that we just wanted to get out of there. We ended up walking out the door at 11:00 pm on the dot! 

My partner and I always tip a min of 20% but often if we like someone we will tip way above. Our service was so terrible that we left her a 15% tip with a note explaining how uncomfortable she made our visit. If she had one ounce of sweetness to her we would've given her 20% BUT she was cold and distant. I understand wanting to get off of work but at least fake a smile and a personality. 

I will not be coming back. Yes, the food was amazing BUT bad service equals a no go in my book. Also, why close the bar 30 minutes early???? The drinks are around $8 so do the math on how much you are losing if our table would've ordered 2-4 drinks. I'm just beyond put off."
1,"This review is about rude, rude Wally. First off, as my 80 year old mother and I were coming in slowly, he said ""hurry up, old lady.""  The food was ok, frankly not one thing to talk about.  A $10 - $14 burgers and salad kind of joint.  My son ordered the halibut special. The bill for a plate with some rice, green beans, and a piece of halibut was $26.95!!!!! I told Wally I thought that was too expensive for a restaurant like his. His response was, ""I guess you haven't eaten in a restaurant lately."" well, Wally, no way am I stepping back in yours."
1,"We like baja Fresh, but this particular location gets 1 Star, due to their crazy unstable hours of being open!  They seem to close whenever they want! If it's not busy, they'll just close! ...esp, on the weekends!, they will close like at 2 PM!!!...I feel this is so stupid, considering that the Light Rail is literally right at their front door & people are getting off it like every 10 mins, so they are just losing money, & with all of the Theatre & Sports Events,...they are totally forgetting all of that, too.   Chipotle is just a few blocks away at Cityscape & they are open til 10 pm,,,,every single night, period!  ...Just go there instead."
5,"I've had BBQ across this great land of ours from Austin to Dallas to NYC to LA to St Louis to New Orleans and places in between and I'm gonna share a secret with you - Smoky Jon's is the best BBQ I've ever had.  The ribs and pulled pork are the most tender, perfectly smoky and best tasting i've had.  I'm not an evangelist for dry rub or wet rub or combo - all I want is good tasting grub.  The sauce here is delicious.  The sides here are also some of the best.  The baked beans have little pieces of pork in em and are super tasty.  

If you're going to the airport its right by the entrance - make a quick stop and you won't be disappointed.

FYI - Jon of Smokey Jon's has won BBQ competitions all over the US.  His BBQ grill is a huge pink pig that he hauls on the back of his truck to competitions.  Jon also is a huge big nice looking man.  He knows his BBQ probably from first hand experience."
5,"Get in your car right now, come downtown and eat here. Awesome funky cool place."
1,"I read the new ass't governor gave a speech there invoking God.  Please, spare me, now I will pass.

Please save that shit for church.  The rest of us will pass on this crap."
5,"Wendy C., how can you review a place that you've never been to? I'm sure the Great Barrier Reef is worth a 5 star review, but I can't give it only 3 stars because its inconvenient (or any review for that matter). 

Anyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. 

I gave it a shot and I was impressed! 

First, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. 

The fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. 

The slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. 

Tarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. 

The bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. 

Everything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.

The service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.

A little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat. 

It's worth it though and I'll be back."
5,"I really don't know what happened with all of the negative reviewers. We've been coming to Imperial Garden since 1997.  We've tried other places, but this place is easily the best  for Chinese food anywhere in the area. Chicken & Broccoli, Beef Lo-mein, Stir fried rice noodles, steamed pot stickers, & the chicken egg foo young are all great! General Tso's is good too.  Staff is very friendly, many have been working there for 10+ years, and we are remembered when we come in- a nice touch. We've been to the westside location as well. Good, but not as good as East, if you ask me. If you don't believe me, take a look at the wall in the lobby. They've won best in Madison nearly every year since 1987! How many restaurants around now can say the same thing??"
5,"I was just  visiting Phoenix over the weekend for the Rock N Roll Marathon on  Jan. 14th. We were staying at the Hyatt Regency on 2nd Street & Monroe, walking distance from the Arizona Center that is blessed with Sam's Cafe! 
I can be a demanding customer due to my dietary needs. I am always in need of altering my menu selection and substituting items. Sam's wait staff & chef were extremely accommodating to me. I had the Fish Tacos on Saturday night with a full serving of steamed vegetables instead of the rice & beans it usually comes with. They also gave me the Chipotle sauce on the side and plenty of salsa... (GOOD salsa)!
We were so pleased with our meal & service that on our last night in town we opted to return to Sam's Cafe knowing we would be satisfied with our meals and the menu has alot of goodies to choose from. I had the Salmon this time on a bed of veggies instead of sweet potatoes. I did let myself indulge in some of their tasty and chips with the chunky & tasteful salsa, (I just ran a marathon)! The chips themselves are very unique mixture of blue corn tortilla, sweet potato chips, and some other varieties...GOOD! 
I will return on any visit to Phoenix!!"
5,"I love going to the Heard especially for their Native + You event every 3rd Friday. The Heard honors the traditions of the past with exhibits such as 'Home' but still allows contemporary Native American artists display their works. It seems their mission is to educate the world of the Native peoples' history as well as their future.  You can not help but appreciate the Native culture, their struggles and accomplishments as you walk through the exhibits especially Boarding School."
1,"i live 4 blocks away from this ""ghetto long line safeway"" (as seen on facebook check-in).  worst customer ""service"" ever.  usually only has 2 lines open, 3 when people start blocking the entire front of the store.  i stopped by tonight to buy a few bottles of my favorite alcoholic beverage, went to the shortest line (the ""express"" line) and was told by the rent-a-cop that this line was closing and that i had to wait in the other line that was 8 carts deep.  

i set my basket down, walked out and drove to Fresh & Easy.  see ya Ghetto Long Line Safeway."
1,We called to confirm price AND went online for estimates. The dispatcher told us it would be less than $15. We got to our destination the clock said 10.50 but they said they had to charge us an additional $12! He blamed it on a new dispatcher. Sorry that is not our problem. We will choose another company next time.
1,"IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT... 
Don't expect customer service! Don't expect them to answer the phone if they're busy during normal Business hours. They won't! And they won't apologize for it either! 

I, along with my co-workers wanted to place over 9 food orders for pick up. After several attempts to call and place our order, Wild Thaiger never picked up their phone. So I drove a few miles to place the order in person only to be told that there was a TWO-HOUR take out waiting time! I wish someone would have picked up the phone at Wild Thaiger instead of wasting my gas and time. 

JUST A LITTLE ADVICE Wild Thaiger, ALL your phone-in customer orders deserve the same respect and assistance as your dine-in customers! If you can't handle the heat, then get out of the kitchen! 

My office and I will be taking our business to Thai Hut and Thai Basil!! Maybe that'll help alleviate some of your stress, Wild Thaiger."
1,"Non attentive staff, VERY rude bartender. Left before getting waited on!"
5,"Love their breakfast menu & they have friendly waitstaff. We go there nearly every Friday for the last 4 yrs.  I love that they don't play any music.  It is quiet, conversational, and comfortable."
1,"Gross, disgusting, rip-off. This place makes me seriously doubt the Madisonian palate. I had a cheeseburger from here a few nights ago. I asked for medium - which to Monty's means completely raw in random spots. Aside from the random rawness, the burger tasted like it was over seasoned with pepper. The meat was of absolute shit quality, the bottom bun was soggy (probably from undercooked meat juices), and I did get it to go. Thanks for the ketchup and mustard packets - now that's classy. I have no reason to set foot in this place. Every experience I've had up to point makes me wonder why I bothered to return one more time. Maybe there's something wrong with my palate, but to be honest, I'm pretty certain that there's not. East side institution? What a joke!"
1,"Most definitely the dirtiest Chili's I've ever experienced, inside and outside. The patio had cigarette butts, a dirty ash tray filled with water from the misters, bits of trash strewn about. Inside tables were left dirty, the bathroom was filthy too.

My food was cold and dried out like it had been made for someone earlier and then left under the warming lights.

Because I was in polite company and we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't sent it back.

I am quite shocked that I didn't get sick after eating there.

Both the health dept and corporate need to make a surprise visit."
5,"I love this place. Every time I go here, I always get entertained by all the cool stuff they offer. You can even get your parking validated for discounted rates. You can learn a lot of stuff by going there. I recommend going to the extra exhibits if you are wiling to shell out a little bit more money. They have a new 4th floor of eco friendly stuff you can explore now too!"
1,"I would give it zero stars if I could. Everything about this place is beyond awful. From the minute I walked into a sub below zero, freezing clinic (Hey you do know people are sick right?) to the doctor who wanted me to tell him what medicine I wanted and diagnose myself, the experience was the worse ever. In fact all of these clinics are terrible. I only go because my insurance contracts with them. I try to avoid going to Urgent Care unless I am dying. The one on Dunlap has a tad better service if you must go. If you can go to another brand of clinics, please do. If you must go to Advanced- ""STAY AWAY"" from this one or the one in Maryvale."
5,"I have always ordered pizza from dominos and the delivery have been so so. I'll get my food and it'll be okay warm and okay good. That's also might be due to the fact that I always get the same stuff. But TONIGHT I got something different. I got a hot sub, bacon and ranch sub. The delivery was really fast for once but the best part was that the food was super hot. It he food was so hot that u couldn't even touch it. Never have I ever gotten delivery that was super hot.  It was SO good ;-) extremely satisfied with the service and food. Thank you."
5,"I've been really happy with All Pets.  They have nice, convenient hours and the staff has always been great.  Being open until 6 p.m. on weekdays is really helpful; the extra hour makes a big difference.  My two cats regularly see  Dr. Haroldson and both have seen Dr. Erickson for injuries/infections. 

I've had no trouble making appointments for regular check ups and vaccinations.  When either cat has had unexpected problems (eye infection, infected cut, etc.) they've been able to get me in within a day, although I was not picky about what vet I saw.  Both Drs. Haroldson and Erickson have patiently and carefully talked me through what I needed to do for home-care and answered all of my questions.  I've never felt rushed or talked down to."
5,"Just had some FANTASTIC pizza at Papa Christos. It's PACKED for lunch every day of the week. There's a reason why locals keep coming back. 

My wife and I had pepperoni and the vegie pizza with spinach, feta and mushrooms. 

Excellent! Very fresh ingredients. Hot out of the oven. Served fast.

Met the owner (Horatio). He's very friendly. From Romania. Family owned."
5,"The fish fry is awesome.  Loved it long time.  The red potatoes with cheese are delish.

It's carry out but that is fine.

Take it out, pop in a movie and have a brandy old fashion.

The latinos working their are hot too."
5,"Joyce was THE BEST! I live in Chicago with only weekends to get the majority of my wedding plans done and she was very helpful about scheduling and working within my time frame.  She made a number of adjustments to the bust of my dress and added a gorgeous bustle.  The work she did was perfect and the amount she charged was amazing!  There have been a couple comments from other reviewers saying she was ""not friendly"" but I did not find that to be the case at all.  I found her to be professional and straightforward. I'm also not looking for people to fawn all over me and treat me like a child.....I would recommend her to anyone for any sort of tailoring or  dress adjustments!"
5,"To keep it short and to the point:
I have a 1999 BMW 323i and have been going to Adam's BMW Repair (Wayne's Auto) for the past 2 years. Adam and his dad, Wayne, are nice, helpful, and very down-to-earth. Adam is a certified BMW mechanic who also worked for Zimbrick BMW. He's honest, respectful, and does great work. Just like the previous reviewer, I am reluctant to share this information but I figured why not."
5,"Let's see, what do I like most about this radio station? hmmmm...

I would have to say, the fact that they pay me. But I should also mention that it's the best country station in the (well) country. 

It also has the best morning show in town: Dave Pratt in the Morning.

Check it out, 5am-9am every weekday."
5,"Starting off with AMAZING BRISKET!!!!

I was walking around this side of town and stumbled upon this deli and I decided to pick up some lunch for myself and my boyfriend who works in this area. Well I walked in and it was empty which usually isn't a good sign but it was 2:00 PM and I figured the lunch rush had come and gone by then. Besides the lack of people I did notice how clean and organized everything was, I liked that! I spoke to the gentleman behind the counter and asked him what the most popular item was and he said the Pastrami or the beef brisket. Since the boyfriend eats anything I got him the Brisket and he offered up some fries with that. I had a hard time understanding much of what he was saying like types of bread for the sandwich or whether I wanted a pickle with the meal but no big deal. Well to put it lightly the Brisket was friggen amazing. I am a very picky eater, I cook well so it is tough for me to eat out because I know I can cook better.... but this sandwich was out of this world tasty. The roll was soft and fresh, the beef was tender, full of flavor and juicy! I will be back!"
1,"really, I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.

my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone ""name please?"", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to ""fit us in"". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.

anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could ""squeeze in"" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,""coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?"". 

the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.

this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred."
5,"Yum, yum, yum.  I felt the need to update the restaurant.  Nothing has changed and that is what I love!

Consistency is appreciate when the quality is so high.  I appreciate that their burgers are as special, juicy and flavorful as always.  They are not trying to dress up the place or make things so fancy.  The truth is, they stick to good, simply and quality food.  So thank you for staying the same and staying fabulous."
5,"I enjoyed the game at US Airways Center; it is a very family and fan friendly arena and sports experience right in Downtown Phoenix.  I have no reason to believe that the franchise will not rebuild and be a contender for the title again in the near future.  --- I went here last month from LA to see my Clippers at Suns!!! This is a first class organization and arena!!! I have been to STAPLES Center many many times; the ushers are very rude even if you have floor seats!!! THE STAFF MEMBERS ON GAME NIGHT AT US AIRWAYS CENTER ARE AMAZING!!!! Great arena, great people, DSLR  camera friendly, fan + family friendly!!! More pics here: http://promotagged.com/?p=966"
1,"Stopped for an early dinner with my wife,she wanted to try the two for twenty special.
As soon as we told the server what we wanted the service went downhill. We did not order any alcohol and we were having the special so this was not going to be a big check for the server but restaruant was not busy so any check should be better than no check.  Used the kiosk to pay for meal since i couldn't get the server to come back to check on us.Discount did not show up on kiosk I shouls have been  more aware since i had heard a similar comment from another table when we came in. Server said not to worry that the amount was correct. I pushed for reciept showing what was actually being charged to ny card. server said she needed my card and would have to talk to the manager. Finally got my paper reciept with correct charges but kiosk on table showed the over charge and had not adjusted. My wife thought we were going to be billed twice for the same meal, so she has been watching the debit card account.
This incident killed my night and the weekend with my wife constantly checking the bank account. This incident is all that my has been talking about to her friends all weekend long, I am sure that this will continue once she gets to work tomorrow."
1,"Alex Optical at Christown/Spectrum has done a few of our glasses. This last time we asked them to do 4 pair of glasses - all but one had to be redone.  They even wanted to charge us for their mistakes.  They finally agreed to fix them for no fee, but why should I have to even ask.

I will use Paris Optical, a little more expensive, but they guarantee their work and give you a free pair of lens within the year after ordering the glasses.  I scratch my glasses and this allows me to get all new lenses (same perscription) within the next year."
1,FYI - this place is closed.  It is for sale.
5,"Clean and friendly, and fresh fare that is always good.  I like the new fuji apple, gorgonzola, grilled chicken topped salad.  Also the Asian chicken and BBQ chopped salads, and lemon, chocolate chip, or snickerdoodle cookies..."
1,"Can I give zero stars? I didn't even get to eat. As soon as we walked in the cashier looked at us and walked in the back and never came back out. The cooks were outside smoking and gossiping about the night before's drunk. This was at 6 pm. Prime dinner time. The tables were all dirty. The visible part of the kitchen was messy and cross contaminated. Overall, we were flagrantly ignored. We left after ten minutes of non-service. I was very sad because I had heard such good reviews and the menu looked good, but the facilities were sketchy."
5,"Dave is a miracle worker. We broke down on Sunday and had our car towed there on the recommendation of a friend. Although we weren't a regular customer, he worked Sunday night (he wasn't supposed to be open) so we could get on our way Monday morning. He did great work for a great price and was completely honest. I couldn't recommend him more highly."
1,"I was visiting Phoenix a few weeks ago and I visited this bookstore. Although they have a nice selection and the prices are fair, I had a disturbing incident with a man I assume was one of the owners. I was looking at a group of books on the shelves and there happened to be a desk nearby which I stayed away from.
I continued looking and the man came running over to me and told me in a very harsh tone that the books in that area were not to be looked at. The area I was in just looked like a regular part of the store and there was nothing stating that the section was off limits. The man was so rude and so hysterical that it completely embarrassed me and made me feel like I was doing something terribly wrong. I told the man that he should rope off any areas he didn't want the customers to look at and he agreed. But I left feeling very angry and embarrassed and didn't purchase the books that I had intended to buy."
1,Horrible bar service... All Draft Beers are out on a SATURDAY! Not worth the stop.
5,"We had a wonderful time at US Airways Center watching a Suns home game. We drove from California and stayed in a hotel in downtown Phoenix...walking distance to the arena. We didn't have to deal with traffic since we were on foot, so I cannot comment on that. We arrived an hour before game time and there was no line at entry. NBA store was stocked and the employees were very helpful. 
As far as food, my husband and I only had a hotdog each (the $3 ones) and they were great! Beers were a little pricey, $11 for a tall can of Dos Equis. 
No lines in the women's restroom, even at half-time!
All in all it was an excellent experience and we will definitely be returning!!"
1,"I am leaving my previous review below, but I subsequently had a terrible experience here.

I needed a new car headlight, and they screwed it up and fried my car.  It took three employees hours to get the headlight changed, and in the process of troubleshooting the damage that their sausage fingers had done in the engine, took out some fuse box thing and put it back upside down.  At that point nothing electronic in my car worked, and the car itself wouldn't start the next day.  A competent mechanic fixed it, but it cost me a significant amount of money and time in towing and mechanic fees.  Autozone was not interested in reimbursing me for the damage they had caused.

Old review:
I just got home from having a new battery put in my car, and I was super happy with my new favorite car store!  

I am incompetent at cars, so I went in saying I thought my battery might be mostly dead.  It was.  Car stuff's expensive.  I'll forgive them.  The Autozone kid was super helpful though.  He spent a good half hour inside car, removing the old battery (my car is the ""labor intensive"" kind of battery holder) and gouging out all the corrosion I had let accumulate.  A half an hour!  He could have easily just told me to do it myself.  

Many a restaurant or retailer could learn from the Autozone business model.  Good service is awesome."
1,"I was excited to work with Carl at my tasting.  I had some issues finding the place and traffic was bad.  My 30 minute trip turned into a 40 minute trip and I was 15 minutes late.  I figured I could talk to him when I got there (rather than try to find his number while driving) and it wouldn't be a big deal.  I got there and was informed he had left for the day.  Ummm ok.  Kind of shady considering he had my number and could have informed me.  I decided I would give it another shot - maybe there was a good reason.  I called a few days later to reschedule and left a message.  Several days passed with no response.  I get that I was late but I am a customer.  I was left feeling he was very stuck up and unprofessional.  He could have said he has a late policy, wasn't available, or said anything at all.  What a waste of time."
5,"This is a great little spot with awesome food, awesome employees who treat everyone like they're friends. The menu is not of the normal run of the mill type but yet a delicious combination that should be tried. As a local business owner and supporter of independent non-chain places to eat, this is a must try! And don't forget that they serve booze! Try the bloody mary or the hurricane!"
1,"Ok, don't get me wrong I have found some unique stuff here, but that was years ago. Now I feel like I'm shopping at a target outlet with awful customer service. Half of the clothes there were shirts from target, and they were maybe 2 dollars cheaper than they were new, which is a bummer when you go in looking for something fun and creative and unique for a good price. 

On another note, the customer service just plain sucked. I don't go in expecting much, but for them to be rude is just such a turn off from the store. I want to love this store, but lately it just seems like a joke. I won't be giving them my business anymore."
1,"Christmas party at Greekfest. I had the steak and my wife had the salmon. I suppose it is possible that they were having a bad night but everything seemed nearly flavorless.

None of it was good.

The desert was about the only thing worth having.

The atmosphere was great and the staff was helpful but they need to rework the kitchen if they want to stay in business."
5,"I used to be an avid food city shopper until I found Ranch market. This store is super clean, organized and has amazingly affordable fresh produce. I literally grocery shop nowhere else. I'm in love."
1,"Stopped by during a brief trip to the area. The food here was very heavy of lard, or whatever they use to cook everything in. Made me slightly ill from sitting in my tummy undigested. Blah. 

I'll pass next time."
1,"Grotesque food, vulgar staff, blech."
5,"I had to write a 5-star review to offset some of the poor reviews.  This is probably the best restaraunt in Madison for vegetarians.  Food is delicious.  I woudn't even know which menu item to review; everything I've had is excellent. 

I'd like to see where some of these other reviewers recommend people eat."
5,"This place is awesome. Even if you don't need anything, just go here and check it out. It's HUGE and filled with every kind of Mexican food you can possibly imagine. Everything is really cheap and they have TONS of fresh produce. They also have a large selection of hot sauces which I love. I haven't eaten there but my roommate used to go all the time and grab food from the little cafeteria looking area. Highly recommended. Need to try the rotisserie chicken that you walk past on your way in one day. Also, look for the gigantic pig head over by the meat. Disgusting, but photo worthy."
1,"Maybe it was because I went on an off night (Tuesday night). Maybe it was because I was there for a company dinner with about 20 people (although the restaurant was empty). Maybe it was because I spent the last three weeks on a whirlwind tour of New York, Philadelphia, and Asheville, NC.

In any case, aside from the service, which was very good, I was deeply unimpressed with the food here. We started off with a plate of gnocchi in an Alfredo sauce and an appetizer of calamari. The gnocchi was completely drenched in Alfredo sauce, which is reminiscent of restaurants that try to hide the quality of their food with excessive sauce, e.g., The Olive Garden. The calamari was a bit rubbery, but otherwise average for a 2-3 star restaurant.

Onto the main course, I opted for the Ossobucco Milanese ($33). Again, this dish was completely covered in sauce. Aside from the bone, I wouldn't have been able to tell what I was eating. The risotto was overcooked, and there was a hint of a taste of dishwater so it was probably diluted to keep it from burning on the stove.

Again, the service was very good. And their bread was probably the best part of the meal. Maybe this place did serve good Italian food at one time, but the oversaucing of the food just killed it for me. For $33, I would like to taste the quality and flavor of the meat. If I wanted to eat gravy, I'd go to Grandy's. And don't get me started on the decor. Wow. Just wow. Think mirrors.

My suggestion would be to skip this place and head over to BLT Steak for their escargot appetizer ($7) during happy hour and then to Beckett's Table for the Pork Osso Bucco Confit ($18). And if you want a cleaner taste, try 5th & Wine. Either way, you'd be spending about $10-$15 less money for much better food and atmosphere."
1,"Horrible service. I bought a $400 belt for a buddy of mine for his birthday and he went the next day to get a bigger size, never wore it or even really touched it. They told him they couldn't exchange it because it seemed a bit bent like if it was worn.

Moreover, the customer ""service"" salesperson brought the belt into the back room and came back with an obvious new hole in the belt. She said that we did it, even though they gift wrap the box and we didn't even touch it after buying it and it was brought back the same day!

Despicable store. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Blatant fraudsters won't even give you any service. I will not let this go lightly."
1,"I went to Guiseppe's February 19th with another person.  It was a disappointing dinner.  Water was served in plastic cups and the napkins were paper.  Both dishes we ordered were tasteless -- adding cheese on top did not help.  The dish I ordered was a mushroom ""stew"" over ravioli dough.  The second time I found myself chewing something very gritty, I called the waitress over and told her the food either had sand or broken glass in it. I gave her a piece of the grit I had taken out of my mouth and, after a long examination by the owner & staff, the owner said he thought it was crystallized sugar.  I think it was dirty mushrooms.  Regardless, I then replaced that dish with pasta fagioli, a little greasy with  90% broth.  Not good. The avocado/tomato salad was delicious.  However, I thought an owner who wanted return business would have comped my meal or, at the least, have offered free coffee or dessert.  Nope!  I will not be back."
5,"So there I was, unknowingly scaling the sometimes greasy, sometimes nasty, always treacherous mountain known as the pinnacle of Mexican Food in Phoenix. And when I finally trudged past the swill near the bottom, (you know who you are, Garcia's, Macayo's, etc) Past the others that were""good"" but not memorable or noteworthy.

There you were, alone at the apex of my appetite of desire... Hello my jewel Rosita's.

Fresh traditional Mexican prepared fast and warm...

Like the menu claims ""Their specialty is good tasting food."" I would swap good with great. And have a margarita too."
5,"We've were in between houses this summer and used the Sun Prairie UPS Store's mailbox for our mail and package deliveries.  I couldn't be more impressed with the staff.  They were always very professional and willing to help out.

As to the reviewer complaining about the shipping prices, UPS prices will always be higher than the post office.  Unless you ship in volume and can negotiate business prices with UPS, they are not the most economical.  However I have far more trust in UPS being able to deliver a package safely and when they say they will than USPS."
1,"If ever there were a real live grinch, It would be the hag (presumably the manager) working 2 days before Christmas.  I was going to buy a bottle of wine, and she came over to let me know in a nasty voice that if I were buying alcohol, I better hurry up.

Well I did, and because the cashier was seriously slow, it was 9:01 when it was my turn at the register.  This woman came over, and snatched the bottle away from the cashier and said something to the effect that I should have hurried up, and they didn't sell alcohol after 9.  The cashier looked really uncomfortable, and mumbled some excuse.  

What is it about the holidays that turns people into complete assholes?"
1,"I was very shocked to see that my review from yesterday had been hidden! What is the point of this website if people can't write their opinion? Obviously whoever is in charge of this restaurant's yelp site didn't want people to see how POORLY my children and I were treated at this establishment. A friend of mine and our 3 little boys (two of them babies) came into eat yesterday when a manager came to us and told us we needed to quiet it down. It was quite ridiculous and offensive, seeing that two of the children are ONE year. Yes sir, let me talk some sense into my baby and tell him that he is being rude. I bring my children out to eat quite often and have never had this issue, my kids are not in any way out of control or bratty. Also, a note to whomever this concerns in management in control of this site: if you take my post down again, I will continue to write this review."
1,The food has no taste.  I went here for my birthday because we saw it on TV.  I have no idea how anyone can give this place a good rating.  If you like tasty food please go somewhere else.  Not even my 3 year old son liked it.
1,"All I can say is thank GOODNESS I paid $15 for this Groupon!  This place does not even deserve a one star! I recently moved to the Phoenix area from California and have been searching for a good yoga studio. I LOVE Groupon and was happy to see several studios I can try out before I purchase a membership.  I have been practicing yoga for several years and have never been so offended during my yoga practice. While I understand that there is a particular flow for Hatha/Bikram yoga (which I prefer Vinyasa Flow), I always try to push myself a little farther with what I have learned in my previous practices at different studios. In the middle of class, I attempted a slightly different pose from what was being taught (without interrupting my fellow yogi's) and the teacher called me out in the middle of class saying ""Can you please do the same pose as the rest of the class?"" (in a derogatory tone) I was absolutely offended by his gesture so I rolled up my mat and walked right out of the class. I sincerely apologize to the other yogi's there for walking out in the middle of class and interrupting their practice but he could have been a bit more tactful with his approach. Perhaps pulling me aside after class and letting me know this was not okay with him would have been more appropriate. So rude! Perhaps it was rude of me to assume I can try and progress my yoga style during his class but I always had encouragment from my previous teachers for pushing myself to evolve in my practice.

In addition, because of the Groupon, the class was extremely packed and there was no room to move or do the poses correctly.  Also, the studio has carpet (which is different than what I am used to) and it is really disgusting! Sweaty, dirty, nasty and probably filled with bacteria. eew! I was already planning on looking for another studio and this incident made me look sooner!

I will never visit this place again and will never recommend this place to anyone. Take my advice and keep looking for another studio!"
1,"Being an Indian i would definitely know what Indian food should taste like, and this one is no way near to the original, Young guy is the son of the actual owner (who is nice guy) is extremely ill-behaved,  gravy we ordered was full of water and tasted like crap. First learn to talk decently with your own country men, later comes serving good  food."
1,"I love Whataburger. The burgers are far and away the best fast food burgers you can get. Don't even say that In-N-Out is better. I always get my burger the same way, #1 Whataburger with sliced jalapeno, grilled onions, bacon, and cheese... yes its indigestion central. The last 3 times I have been there I got home only to realize my burger was not how I ordered it. The first time, they gave me a whole grilled jalapeno. What the hell am I going to do with this other than get a firebomb in my stomach? and the onions weren't grilled. Who goes to Whataburger and orders a side of a giant jalapeno!? 

Second visit, there were no jalapenos to speak of whatsoever, not even the giant grilled one. They got the onions, cheese, and bacon right though.

Third visit, I straight up got someone elses order. I got a friggin chicken sandwich. I'll make the trek to another store from now on. This one is just craptastic."
1,"I like the food okay but the service--geez, very rude girl at bakery counter!  If I hadn't wanted the AZ cookie so badly I would've just walked out.  There's better (and closer) bakeries than this one."
1,Gross hotel!  Nasty carpeting. Very old furniture. Room was wayyyy too hot and moving thermostat didn't help. Dryer air than the dessert. I woke up with a bloody nose due to the lack of humidity. Horrible experience.
1,"I'm so over this place.  Without fail, it is an unpleasant experience.  The upselling is obnoxious and they a half-assed job."
1,"Went to this location today to meet friends because it was the closest to the middle of our houses.... thanks Good Egg for totally ignoring the SW Valley :/

I drove here not expecting much (always known this location as the crappy one), I had been to this location while it was still under the forgotten step-child The Eggery.  I was surprised that they had finally gotten rid of that name and changed the signage to The Good Egg (not sure if this is recent or not, I haven't been down this part of Camelback in a bit of time).  Upon seeing the new signage, I thought perhaps there would be a better experience to be had.... no, nope, not at all.

I met my party that was already seated in the WAAAAAAY outdated restaurant... I mean seriously people, the bakery cases that haven't been used in decades, the wood, the wallpaper, the metal chairs, and all the BRASS... oh my goodness all the brass....YUCK!..... Give this place a little attention Good Egg.

When I sat down I found half of the table wet and no napkins, a little puzzled I asked what the deal was.  Apparently the waiter had spilled the water all over the table and used our napkins to try and wipe it up.... I repeat TRY to clean it up, he didn't succeed. Perhaps if he had went to get a towel he could of gotten all the water up, but apparently he never did (as this happened 10 min. before I got there and there was still puddles all over the table.  Nor did he come back with fresh napkins...nice buddy, nice.

After being there for about 5 minutes the guy came to ask if I wanted anything to drink... Coffee and cream please. And walks away before we can say that we are ready to order... Now I am the ding dong who was a half hour late because my ass slept in, so friends were huunnngggry.....He comes back with coffee (lukewarm at best), no cream, and walks away...AGAIN.  We sit, and sit, and sit.  He finally comes and ask if we are ready to order, umm.. we had been there 45 minutes and 15 minutes...yeah, I think we've got it.   We order and remind him again of the cream and napkins.

He comes back with cream, no napkins.  sigh.

Food finally comes, order is right, but haphazardly prepared.  Maybe the kitchen guy overslept too?  

I have the Monterrey, it is missing tomatoes and you can tell that it was almost forgotten about because the eggs were starting to brown, my english muffin is nearly burnt and looks like it was toasted on a grill that needs some scrubbing, the cook compensated by soaking it in butter. Dollar Pancakes were shaped like road kill, and the side plate they came on was placed on my main plate.  That's no big deal, I don't care.  But as I am going fork to plate the server takes the side plate off the main plate...umm...eew, don't touch my food once it has hit the table.  I worked my way through high school and college waiting tables, I have a high tolerance for eew, but some things just bug me right away... this is one of them.  Dude, if you touch my food while it is in the kitchen, ignorance is bliss, but if you do it in front of me once the food is ON THE TABLE for goodness sake then that shit just be NASTY yo!  I know damn well there is a good chance your hands aren't clean.  Practically no food workers wash their hands as much as they are supposed to unless the health inspector is there....sorry people, its true.

Friend 1 had an even more crispy looking omelet.  Friend 2 got a turkey sandwich.  It was dry, and lacking in well... turkey! It looked as if they had folded up one piece of lunch meat to make it look more substantial.  Her salad was pretty lame looking and had the runniest ranch dressing I had ever seen.  What was even worse is that there was one sad runaway strawberry in her sandwich... wtf? Check your cold storage bins people!  If Friend 1 had been the one to order the sandwich instead of Friend 2 then I wouldn't be writing this review right now because I would be supporting Friend 1 in the HOSPITAL!! Friend 1 has a major strawberry allergy.  i understand shit happens, but how does a STRAWBERRY get put on a TURKEY sandwich and the cook doesn't notice?!??!!!

We could of said something if our server wasn't practicing his disappearing act again. Only time we saw him after he dropped off the food was when he dropped the check, and kindly paused out of his busy day to say ""Everything ok?"" ...kind of waited for a response and walked away.. no ""thank you"" ""have a good day"" ""come again"" ""bugger off"" nothing....  Mind you I use the word ""busy"" lightly, there was about 6 tables in the whole place full at 10am, and at least 4 other servers that I saw.


This was the third time I had been to this location... shitty experience as always, you know what that means people.... three strikes you're out! (oh and the water pitcher that half of which was spilled all over...the water was unfiltered grossness...boo :/ )"
1,Tried the kung pao shrimp and veg chow mien. Nothing great. Service was also not good. Although I did go just before it closes. Even then I asked if you guys are still serving and would have been more than satisfied if they denied service. Looking at all the reviews. I might just try it again. But for now.... NOT Satisfied.
5,"Ever since their renovation, this place has knocked it out of the park.  This is THE place to go for a cold beer after a softball game.  Hungry?  No problem!  Their menu is extensive and everything that I've had has been excellent.

I especially recommend the pizza - you don't expect great pizza from a bowling alley, but they do a great job.  It's a favorite of ours.  Their burgers are top notch as well.  I haven't had the gyros, but a friend of mine raves about them.  The kids menu is great - my little guy destroyed their mini corn dogs.

The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The owners put a lot of hard work and time into this place, and it shows.  On a cool summer evening, you can't beat sitting out on the patio with a cold one."
5,"Darlene can work wonders on clothes that don't fit right. I've been coming to her for 2 years, ever since I moved to Madison, and have never been disappointed. Highly recommend!"
1,They like to run expensive tests and we believe them to be dishonest. We had been going there for years but no more.
5,"Killer Mexican Food! The chips 'n salsa kicks ass! You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip! Hellava start! A kick-butt margarita! Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST! ...Cannot wait to return! Great ambiance.......... Move over, Manuels & TEE PEE....ew!"
5,"Busse's is very much a typical neighborhood tavern, with cheap drinks (cheapest in the city that I've found) and nice down to earth people.  Recent updates have been made as far as tv's, games, sound system, etc., so if you haven't been in a while to catch a game or hear some music (the old juke box was circa 1970's) you might give it another shot.  

If you are into ""bomb"" shots the Chuck Norris shot is something you need to try.  If you like tap beer the selection is limited, but very inexpensive, and the lines are always clean (hint: the owner drinks tap beer).  Cocktails are stiff, and REALLY inexpensive.  

If you're a northsider looking for a new local hangout, or someone heading to a Mallard's game looking for a spot near Warner to hit up before or after the game (they always have Mallard gameday specials) this is the place."
1,"Over the years this place has experienced a sharp decline from a place people used to want to take their kids for birthday parties and dinner after church on Sunday. It now is mostly crowed by those who are just looking for cheap food and a lot of it. Poncho's used to run commercials stating they were an all you can eat buffet but during my last trip I noticed that the eat all you want spirit had been crushed and thrown out the back door with the trash. 

Seriously with as much time as it takes for them to see your little flag on the table and to bring you the food item you requested you will lose intrest or just give up and and hit the taco bell drive through on your way home.

The server I had did her best to keep up with the huge level of requests she was being given but seemed tired and mad most of the time. Kind of made me wish I could just go up there and just get what I wanted just so she would not have to. That is the way it used to be and I wish they would go back to that policy but they will not because they know you will eat less that way. 

The one thing that would make me even want to step foot in the door would be the basket of chips and salsa they give along with the little pillows of goodness also known as sopapillas that are served with honey. To be honest most kids will still like this place as they do serve food that they like such as tacos and also have a sundae bar with soft serve ice cream and tons of toppings. But if you are like me and do not want to have to suffer for cheap food just skip this place on by."
1,"Get your wallet out! This place nickel and dimes you to death and they seem proud of it. 

I buy a room for a night and a conference room for a day. In the lobby and my sleeping room I get free internet but when I walk in the conference room they want to rob me of $50.00. The workers were embarrased to tell me this and when I asked to speak to someone in charge they told me the managers will not discuss it. 

If that is not enough they jab me for another $2.65 for a cup of coffee to include a refill. 

I don't care how nice the place is (and it is nice) I will not come back."
1,"There are ONLY two people who work in this HUGE store today and neither know where lamp oil is or were able to call a manager because the ""manager is busy in a meeting."""
5,"Loved the employees of this store.  I told them I need to get 2 drinks with the hospital, with food, and 2 bags, so they put my drinks in to a carrier and sealed my hot drink with green plug so it does not spill.  SWEET!!!"
5,"Called direct to the flower shop after picking an arrangement that was listed on their website. Person was very professional who took my order. They were able to deliver the same day too! My Mother-in-law was very happy - she sent a picture of what we order- flowers looked fresh, with a nice assortment of flowers. Highly recommend this florist. (Order was placed from Delaware)."
5,"As a student and aficionada of Native American culture, I have to say this is by far and away the best Native American themed museum I've ever seen.  While it isn't that large, it packs a punch with razor sharp exhibitions and a physical plant that is both cutting edge and serene.  Well worth a stop for road-trippers driving between austin and los angeles, or anyone who is doing time in phoenix for whatever reason.  highly, highly recommended."
1,"My bed was infested with some kind of small parasite. I felt crawling on my body all night, and found small bloodstains on my pillow in the morning. Further inspection revealed tiny, blood-engorged bugs. I agree with the manager that they did not appear to be bed bugs, as they were too small and red, not black. They were also not ticks or fleas. Manager comped us the room, but I slept badly and was horrified!
Service was polite, but room was shabby, amenities weak, and lots of construction."
1,"I have been here multiple times and have usually had great experiences, but last night was awful.  We made reservations as they had a promotion for National Cheeseburger Day and there were six of us.  When my friend and I got there, we told the hostess that we were meeting friends and had a reservation under another friend's name, and she shrugged at us three times before asking us how many were in our party and never bothered to find our reservation.  We told her we had an infant with us, and she looked annoyed to have to accommodate a baby.  She eventually asked us if we wanted to wait for the others in our party or sit down, and then walked us to our table and told us nothing about who our server was or ever cracked a smile.  

We sat for at least 10 minutes with no service and eventually flagged down a waiter, who found our server, who arrived about 5 minutes later.  The drink service was incredibly slow, and the food service was okay.  Our burgers were average, which was disappointing since we've come there often and enjoyed the burgers.  It seems their buns and meat have changed and the quality is not as good as it had been.  

A disappointing trip, and we likely won't be back anytime soon."
1,"Everytime I go to this place I wonder why.  Why do I pay for the VIP wash when they do no more than what you get for the basic?  I went this last weekend and my SUV literally went from vacuum to wash to interior in less than 10 minutes. 
Yes, you'd think that would be a good thing.  But there were literally 3 cars ahead of mine in the row it was in.  This place is based on pushing cars through, NOT cleaning them.

They did nothing more than smear their cheap version of armor-all on the tires and wash the windows.  This is VIP?  What a joke.  I told the attendant (who actually spoke english!) to run it through again, this was pathetic, but he said, no I'll clean it, and he took a dirty rag out of the back of his shorts (he might as well have used his tighty-whities, they'd be cleaner) and started rubbing down the console and such.  

Yeah, that's what I want.  Danny, you should be ashamed to put your name on this joke of a car wash.  And I should be double ashamed to have run my car through this place repeatedly over the years.   What am I thinking?  I'm an idiot.  Never again."
1,"Where does one begin?  Sat ourselves at a booth.  Had to wait 15 minutes for someone to ask us if we would like something to drink.  Took for ever to order food.  Food came out individually over the course of 10 minutes....  The food order was wrong and it did not taste that great.

Here are a few things that you will experience when you go if you decided to go at all.

Wait 5 to 10 minutes to be seated......
Wait 5 to 10 minutes to get drinks ordered......
Wait 5 to 10 minutes to get food ordered.....
Wait 5 to 10 minutes before you get all of you food to the table....

Not worth the experience...  Not worth the money....   OverEasy is far far better!"
1,"Go to Lindstroms on Indian School!!!!!!!!

Its been 3 or 4 weeks since I last washed my car, so I took it to Danny's yesterday because the location was more convenient than Lindstroms - Trader Joes was on my to-do list.

I had little mud splatters on one side of the car - somebody must have driven through a puddle while I was parked.  But I was getting the car washed for general reasons, not just because of the mud splatters, so I made the mistake of not looking closely after Danny and his Family were done washing.

When I got back home, I noticed most of the little mud splatters were still there.  My first thought was ""sh%t, its paint and not mud"" but I scraped one with my finger and it came right off.  And there are water spots all over one window, coffee and dust in the cup holder, etc etc.

So now I need to go back and argue with a manager, or pay again at Lindstroms.  I think I will pay again and go to Lindstroms - I've been a big fan ever since they got raided by the Country's Worst Sheriff:)  You get raided by Sheriff Joe, you must be doing something right."
5,I never belonged to another gym.  It's a solid place to work out.  You can get involved or stay solo and no one mind.  The staff is very nice.
1,"Our weekly Empowerment meeting creates around lunch. It seems we are forever looking for a place that has good prices and a quiet place for us to brainstorm and raise our energy. We have stumbled upon Duck and Decanter. 
Finding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose. 

Opening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise! 

Of course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck! 

I quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad. 

You can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational. 

There are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...

I get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting. 

I open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten. 

Too hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff? I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad? 

I was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese?!? Who eats cheese with their tuna? 

The tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic! 

Some restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible. I truly believe this is something Duck and Decanter could adopt. Maybe I was supposed to order dressing, I have no idea. Since I had never been there before and did not know what I was doing. 

I did ask someone else about the ingredients and she took the time to look and confirmed my suspicions-sigh. 

I can't wait until there is a conscious shift to what we are putting in our bodies and those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant can eat without anxiety! 

Is this a place for those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant? 
NO there is not enough awareness of ingredients, and handling of food. 

Bathrooms? yes weird..outside of the building, but clean. 

Would I return? 
No but for the sake of my friends, which is way more important, I will and eat some where else first."
5,"Wonderful food, service & atmosphere at a decent price.  I had the carnitas - the meat was perfectly moist, tender and just enough spice.  Hubby had a chicken burrito - it was thoroughly enjoyed.  House margarita topped the meal wonderfully.  Waitress was very attentive and friendly.  A group of 10 people came in and the staff made sure they were seated promptly.  Couldn't ask for better service."
1,"About 3 weeks ago, I had breakfast at 5&Diner with a colleague, we rarely have a day off together.  It was perfect.  PERFECT!  3 eggs, over medium, and I mean they were perfectly cooked ""medium"", best hashed browns I've had since the Aristocrat in Boulder, awesome!

Went back two weeks ago, ordered the same the same menu; the food came up so quickly, it had to have been just sitting there, an overcook, whatever, it wasn't ""fresh"".  I know this much for sure: it wasn't nearly as good as the first visit.

Today, a late breakfast, I enter about 10:55am and I get the last table.  Now, I've been in the restaurant business and when the hostess fucking apologizes to the waitress for sitting the single patron at the last table, I'm already a little pissed.

I tell the server I heard that comment and ""...I'll TRY to be a good little patron"", kiss my ass.  I order right away, so probably close to 11:00am.  At 11:36, I give her a HUGE EYE-ROLL, ""where is my food"" and she say's she'll check.    She'll check?

[I want to take a moment to talk about CONSISTENCY.  If a restaurant is so prompt so as to have served me almost instantly on my prior visit, you cannot justify a 36-minute PLUS wait for any reason.  More on the ""reason"" why the order was so late in a moment]

I said, ""no thank you.  Allow me to pay for the coffee and OJ and I'll be on my way"".  The server was nice, mgt said no chg for the beverages -- thank you and there shouldn't have been a chg -- I even said to her, ""It's not your fault.  I have no cash, I'll come back with a tip.""  Which I would have done had she not said, ""...it was the 'extra crispy' on the hashed browns.""  In other words, my order was 20 minutes late because I wanted extra crispy hashed browns.  BALDERDASH!  THAT'S B.S

Last, TOO MANY FLIES!  GET A PEST-STRIP. SOMETHING!

I'll never come back.  Ever."
5,"I've been to a lot of bike shops around Madison, and Revolution is my favorite. 

They're approachable and in support of finding you the safest cheap way to stay riding. They also stand by their tune-ups for the whole season. None of the  ""hey we're actually going to charge you another $50 because we didn't tighten your brakes to your liking.""

I had my touring bike built through them last year, and all along the way they had resources and words of encouragement. The staff is amazing too. My only regret is that I always have work when their maintenance classes are."
1,"I went to the Phoenix Hard Rock Cafe for lunch on a Friday. It wasn't very busy, so I figured I would sit at the bar. The two servers/bartenders were super nice and friendly. So was management that I spoke with so I have nothing negative to say about the service. It was quick and friendly. 

But the menu! It sucks! It is way overpriced! And nothing I had was good. For $10 I got the worst plate of nachos I have ever had! Sure it was big and plenty to share and even more to throw out, but it was awful. Glad I didn't pay another $4 for meat because it was so bad that even meat could not improve it! The beans had no flavor, the jalapeno provided the only bit of flavor to the plate. The salsa was pure trash- more live crushed tomatoes and no flavor! You would think in the SW they could at least adapt and go with a better salsa! 

My other pick was potato skins, I love the things. The guy next to me ordered them, $9 for a half plate of the tiny-est potatoes I think anyone could skin! I think there were 6 halves but certainly not more than 8 halves, all the size of a child's palm! 

I had a frozen drink called a Pickled Tink $6.75. Awful! Did not come completely mixed and barely pink. Tasted overwhelmingly of the coconut flavor. It was frozen and slushy and weak enough to feed to a kid. If I had one with me I would have let him/her have it, seriously. 

It was my birthday as was maybe 4 other unfortunate souls to be eating there. They gave us each a Sundae with fudge on the whip cream and a small candle. They shouted at the patrons to to shoot Happy Birthday at each of us at separate times and clap. It was pretty weak by the third attempt to get participation. 
It was nice of my servers to surprise and acknowledge me. Though I was not looking for any handout or commotion. I had a few bites of the sundae and it was even awful! The ice cream was full of ice crystals! 

So over all I will have to disagree with others and say Applebee's food is much, much better and not as expensive! To Applebee's I'll return but to the HRC, this is my last visit. 

Years ago I went to the Phoenix HRC when it was on Camelback, if I remember the street correctly. The building & bar was more impressive as was the decor and so was the food. I went on a birthday then too, I wonder why they moved to this location? The entry is nothing eye catching or grand as it was then. In fact if the Light Rail driver had not announced it i would not have seen it as I had not seen it on previous trips to and pass the area. 

Before this stop at the HRC, I had been a fan of the place for years. Had once spent many evenings at the Boston HRC when I lived in MA and had fond memories of the old Phoenix location as well. But just as the music we call Rock has deteriorated so has this conglomeration! So long fair well HRC, I withdraw my support of you."
5,"Been there twice now.  Great servers and the owner is a sweetheart.  I ate the Pechuga Asada and a pupusa Locoye(sp?) this time.  The chicken was made right, great beans and rice, fresh avocado,  big portions and the salsa and chips are excellent.   I live two blocks from here and I need to wake the eff up and go here more."
5,"This review is for one thing only: iced coffee.

I travel a lot for work and try to seek out a local coffee shop to get my iced coffee fix. Normally, I'm disappointed...not so with Barriques.  The iced coffee (listed as cold brewed for 12 hours) is delicious.  Dark and strong just as I prefer."
1,"All I can say is yuck. I expect a lot from chain/franchises. Maybe the food won't be the highest quality, but the service and cleanliness should be right on. And it should be fast.
I went here a couple of times and was dissapointed every single time. The last time I went, I got a bagel with cream cheese for take out. I got home and started eating it and, would you believe it, it tasted like cigarettes!! Clearly, whoever made it had just been smoking, came back inside, and made my food without washing their hands!!!! Respulsive, I didn't even bother to go back to complain.
I will never give Einsteins my business again.
Looking through Yelp, I see a ton of bad reviews about all of the Einsteins. You would think corporate would take these reviews from the general population into some serious consideration. We may not be official food critics, but we do know what is going on."
5,"For those that are interested, GVSS has been the single most influential change on my daily lifestyle I ever decided to make. It was a low risk decision given that it's non-invasive compared to any type of surgery. However, I did not anticipate how quickly I would experience the positive impacts. I was a soft contact lens wearer and alternated with glasses. Since going to GVSS, I have far less worries including dry or tired eyes from frequent computer use and travel. I also have the freedom of feeling I will never need to wear glasses or travel with them as a back-up ever again. Unexpectedly, the clarity of vision amazes me including night vision. I also appreciate the fabulous team at Brandon Eyes who always manages to impress."
1,"I have been here on multiple occasions and each time the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Their selection in 38s-40s seems pretty limited. 

I've been twice now when I was looking for a particular color / style. When asked if I needed any assistance, the answer to ""yes, I'm looking for x type of jacket in x color"" should not be to say, ""hold on a few minutes while I"" do something and then to leave your customer waiting 10+ min for an answer.

Save yourself the hassle and go check out, pretty much anywhere else. I hear they sell jackets and suits at the thrift stores. At least there I'm expecting to be ignored and have to fend for myself when trying to find something."
1,The drive thru is the issue here.... One word SLOW. I'm a huge Rockys fan but I'll drive to the east side location bc this location is just way too slow! It takes a solid 10-15 min. For the drive thru and sometimes the pizza is old and  nasty bc its sat too long. It's too bad bc there's not alot of competition on the north side.
1,The employees of Best Buy are super shady. Purchased over 2000 laptop out of state. Purchased additional ram to be installed by best buy and their geek squad. I stopped by to pick up and they want to charge another $30 for the install. I can't believe how dishonest this company is. The geek squad manager implied she didn't care what the salesman from another store told me. I guess they are all independent!  Customer service is extremely lacking. I knew I should have went to Fry's Electronics!
1,"The first time I came here something was wrong, they gave me a discount and a stamped card for a free meal. I went back after 6 months to give them a second chance and my biscuits and potatoes where cold upon being served. I noticed discoloration in my scrambled eggs and everyone elses eggs where bright yellow. .The food is over priced, My order was $8.50 and it didnt even include at least two pieces of sausage. the waitress could not do her job and notice that there was 3 of us and only 2 sets of utensils so I had to wave another employee down.  will never eat there again. I dub this place the bad egg"
5,"I went here at the suggestion of several people who told me how great the food was. I admit my experience with Indian cuisine is limited, but for the most part pleasant, so I thought it was worth a try. 

The food was outstanding! I ordered Aloo Ghobi. Really flavorful and spicy. I don't know if this is commonplace everywhere, but since I moved up from Texas it's been really difficult to order a dish and be satisfied with the level of heat. Here they asked if I preferred mild or hot, when I said hot, they asked how hot, I said very and they definitely delivered. My husband ordered the tandoori chicken which is a very generaously sized portion. It comes out on what looks like a small griddle, steaming, with peppers and lemon slices. They also brought out a big bowl of white rice along with some Naan bread that we asked for. All in all, it was a very satisfying experience and we will definitely be going back!

Service can be a little slow, but the staff are very attentive and helpful. They're also really good at refilling drinks, I know it seemed like our server kept refilling my glass every time I took a sip."
1,"I used to go to Ingleside animal hospital for all my pets needs. I had a very sick kitty that they could not figure out what was wrong. The only option was exploratory surgery for an amount that was way out of my budget. I also didn't think my kitty would survive the surgery. They attempted to find every $!00 treatment they could over the course of several years. Never did figure out what ailed him. They got the money in the long run. Once my kitty needed some more antibiotics for an abscess that Dr. Serbin had already seen and prescribed for. The abscess came back. I had recently lost my car and my job and asked if they could just call a script in to a local pharmacy as i didn't have the $ for a cab ride or the visit. It had been 4 months since his last office visit and like i said they had seen this poor kitty dozens of times on deaths door over years. He told me it wasn't ethical to prescribe the meds that i needed to come in. I was irrate. I had just been in there for another cat 2 months prior and had a standing antibiotic script for him so I asked if they could call in the script for the other animal they had just seen. He told me that he wouldnt because he knew I would give it to the other animal.  I ended up having to get my hands on some from someone else. otherwise my poor cat would have went without. I wrote a letter to them of how upset i was and got no reply.

 A few years later after trying many other vets and the sick kitty had passed away the other kitty I had needed a dental cleaning. I had saved adamantly to acquire the funds to get it done over 2 years. (its very expensive. In light of my experiences there I trusted their competency with doing the dental surgery so I returned back money in hand over $400. My anger from previous grievances were furthest from my mind had just about forgotten and just wanted my cats teeth cleaned. On the day of the appt because of my cats age they did pre blood work for the surgery and it came back he was diabetic. I couldn't believe it i had another cat that was diabetic and this one didn't show any of the signs i was shocked so they ran some more tests and loaded me up with insulin and never cleaned his teeth. My bill was just about all of the $400 i had desperately saved. Every time i gave the cat insulin his sugar would crash. I ended up going to a different vet (BLUE CROSS animal hospital) who eventually did the surgery and said that his mouth was causing his diabetes and he just needed it done. I suspect  Ingleside purposely ran my bill up and didn't treat my animal because of past disputes. I have no proof but I will never pass on a chance to warn other cat owners to avoid them I will never return there and am so much happier with BCAC. I live in tempe now but will gladly drive to BCAC."
5,"I was on the east side for the evening and saw Cool Beans. I remembered I had a coupon and decided to try them out. The staff was helpful in making my choice of drink, I got the Turtle latte. It was so amazing and the girl and the guy who were working there were friendly as could be. I will be going back! Worth checking out."
5,So good!!! We went as a group and everyone loved the food they ordered.  The food was very reasonably priced!! Yum!
5,I've been here twice and never been let down. Great food from the chips n salsa to the entree. The margaritas are excellent also.  Must stop if your in the area. Service very good.
1,"Today I happened to stop by at this Old Navy location looking to purchase last clothes and shoes for my little sisters who are going away for summer break abroad with their father.   After deciding what shoes I was happy with I remembered I did not recall my sisters shoe size.  As I searched for my phone I realized I had forgotten it at home. ( oh bummer ) I politely asked to use store phone and was declined the service.   ""But I drove here from a fair distance can I just use it to call and verify the shoe size of the six year old and ten year old"".  ""Can you just make a guess and if they don't fit, you can come back tomorrow"" I was very very upset with the level Of and Lack of Service ."
5,"One of my favorite lunch spots.  Again, a family owned restaurant that I absolutely love!

This is the best Greek in town!  It is authentic, inexpensive and tasty.  It makes that Big Fat place look like Olive Garden. 

My favorites are the gyro feta pita, the hummus, chicken picado pita (add feta), the french fries are probably the best ever, the dolmades are little bites of sunshine.  The portions are huge and they are always generous with the feta (and the onions - who eats that many onions anyway?!).  The onions are easy to pick off though...

They have the best fruit salad bowl I've ever had!

The owners and the staff are the best!  I just wish that I could convince them to open for dinner and for the weekends.  

Plus, I always feel safe with all of the cops who eat there!"
5,"I had a great time at this museum. I normally go through museums pretty quickly, and this place took me about two hours. 

They have a huge collection of local Native American tribal artifacts and some interesting diorama type things (a life sized model of an oven for baking bread, a couple examples of traditional housing etc). Also a few rotating collections. I saw an exhibit about foods/products indigenous to the Americas (chocolate, cochineal, etc) and an exhibit about the boarding schools/ assimilation. 

There is also a small collection of other tribal artifacts from elsewhere in the world. These don't make sense- they should loan to other museums and expand their interactive exhibits."
1,"My husband lived in England and had a strong reccomendation on this place because of the food.  We didn't make it that far.  

When we walked in everything look dirty- the floors, walls, booths, pool tables - and the place was dimly lit!  I could not believe this bar served food.  Nothing about it said restaurant.  The decor was everything British which may have been cute if they took a rag and wipe the dust off.  No one greeted us when we walked in so we just sat down at a table.  There was a waitress wandering around that looked just as lost as we did.  She finally came over and gave us some menus, took our drink order and that was it... we never saw her again.  While we waited we had a while to look over the menu.  All the British food sounded like some type of variation of pot roast.  I guess that's what British cuisine consists of but none of it sounded appealing.  Still waiting it gave me more time to look around and I started to get angry because I couldn't believe I was about to order food from such a dirty establishment (I could only imagine what the kitchen looked like).  I was shocked to see kids running around... I wouldn't take Bebe's kids in there. 

I clocked it; for 15 minutes we sat there without food or drinks, just menus.  Our booth faced the bar and the bartenders looked at us a few times but never sent anyone over to our table. Could I have asked for our server?  Sure.  But by this point I knew I wasn't spending a dime here and wanted to see how long it would take someone to come over to us so I could tell what I thought of their service.  Finally we receded, parched and starving we got up and left the George & Dragon.  What a waste of time!"
1,"Surly, poor service - we spotted a couple of thick gray-white hairs floating on top of my girlfriend's wine. After scowling at us for bringing it up, the new bartender from Flagstaff poured out the wine and then informed us that these were tiny strands of cheese from our con queso, which my girlfrind didn't touch and was about 2 feet away from her. It is obvious when you have hairs in your drink!
In attentive service from that point on, but when we left after awarding the bartender the 5% tip (more than he deserved) he pursued us down the sidewalk to the south, outside the building by walking along the plate glass windows on the inside, banging on them alongside as we walked. 
What a weird experience! Been going here for years and years, some of their dishes are quite good, others not so hot; wine list pretty indifferent and slipping. But this kind of behavior is a game changer. I will never go back."
5,"I've had BBQ all over the country but the sauce here is my kind of flavor. The meat is so tender and juicy it hardly needs sauce, but the sauce is so good I have to get an extra cup on the side! All the sides are tasty so you can't go wrong there."
1,"I'm confused why anyone would choose to go here.  
To be clear, my expectations were that it would be an all Asian version of Noodles & Co.  Cheap, decent, fresh food.  
Cheap - yep
Decent - no
Fresh - maybe at one point
I ordered the Thai curry noodles.  Not impressed.  I've never tasted something that claimed to be curry with so little flavor.  My vegetables were obviously charred and they still sent me the dish.  Yuck.  My boyfriend ordered the teriyaki udon, and the noodles were too skinny to be udon with the same flavor issues.  Not even the chili garlic sauce did much to it.  
Chin's - good concept, but a waste of money even at $6."
5,"I give Cooperstown a five star - based on their pricing alone.  I ate lunch with 2 kids and our bill was $30 with tip.  The food is nothing fancy - just delicious and refreshing on a hot day.  The girls said their chicken fingers and mac and cheese was good and I really enjoyed the Ty Cobb Salad.  Also, love the giant glasses of iced tea.  

The service was attentive and quick for being so busy.  Neat place to go overall."
5,"Absolutely adorable!

This place made our 5 (yep you heard it here...5) hour wait much more enjoyable.  I think it we had to sit in the same building as the pizzas were being made and had to smell the delicious aroma of others pizzas for 5 hours, I may have gone nuts.  Bar Bianco was relaxed and had everything anyone could ask for while waiting for your meal.  We loved the Arizona wine and enjoyed a tasty plate of cheese and meat while lounging in the cozy chairs in the corner.  

Not only is this bar a great 'waiting room' before Pizzeria Bianco, but I would consider coming here just to relax and have a drink.

Cheers!"
5,"There may be equals but not better restaurants than the Wild Thaiger. (Have no idea what a Thaiger is...is there a tame one?)  Anyway, went there today for lunch for thefirst time and was super impressed.  Service by a drop dead georgeous Thai waitress was excellent.  Food was superb...don't see how it could have been better.  Wife had chicke curry which was excellent.  I had pad tai which could not have been better.  Food came immediately.  Steaming hot.  Lovely!!
Hardest part of visit was finding the parking lot.  Once you know where it is, you'll always know.  I parked on right side of the building.  Fortunately there's a sign saying it's on othe other side.  From then on.....a piece of cake.
I'm no stranger to Thai food and Wild Thaiger is one of the best."
1,"We ordered the ""California Vegetarian Burrito w/ enchilada sauce."" Took two bites and asked for our money back. Seemed like the strategy was to hide the taste of old food with onions.  The enchilada sauce was dark brown and had mystery chunks in it, and tasted burnt. 

Three times the price of Taco Bell and half as good."
1,"Seriously, people giving this place high reviews? When we went here last, the chicken was dry and had a burnt coating that slid right off. And it was somewhat temperate in the middle, confirming my suspicion that this was made earlier and then just re-fried, cut, and served. I don't think any restaurant should get any stars when they just open a can or packet (yes, I'm talking about the vegetables and sauces) and mix with pre-cooked meat. That IS NOT good Chinese food. As someone who has lived where there are actual Chinatowns (Boston and San Francisco), I know what very good Chinese food is, and this place certainly is not.

Oh, and the lighting. Who said that bright, overhead lighting creates a pleasant atmosphere for dining? 

I have yet to find a Chinese restaurant here in the Phoenix area that actually puts together fresh ingredients from scratch. If anyone knows of one, please let me know."
5,"Ever just want excellent Mexican food for your party, just like Mama used to make but without the days of preparation and cooking?  We ordered from Comedor's catering menu:  green chicken enchiladas, chicken flautas (substitution of their tacos) and rice for our Halloween party.  Surprisingly, Comedor also included a quart size of guacamole, salsa, sour cream and two big bags of tortilla chips.  Prices were extremely reasonable and the food was amazing!  I'm not a big green chili fan but I am now!  Chunks of fresh green chili on the enchiladas and boy, were the enchiladas plump full of chicken!  

I've decided that I'll never slave over a kitchen stove to prep for a party or get together.  El Comedor's catering menu saved me tons of time and headache AND it was extremely affordable.  I got to enjoy our party and everyone couldn't say enough great things about the food!"
5,"Quick, friendly, helpful service. Love how they have all their repair/installation/service prices posted. Somewhat limited, but quality inventory. Love the cat roaming the establishment too. Any establishment with a cat gets a star automatically."
5,"Dave is an awesome VW sage.  He's helpful, friendly, has prices that are much better than Zimbrick, he is fast and just all around one of the good people.  I just hope this review doesn't cause him to get inundated and wreck his speedy turnaround time!  Seriously, the place is awesome."
1,"I was visiting family and we decided to go out to eat and found this place 5 minutes from my sisters house.  We stood at the front for 15 minutes with no acknowledment from ANY employee (we did show up kind of late so if it was because they were closing soon all they had to do was say so instead of ignoring potential future customers, the restaurant was not packed and there were servers standing inside talking to one another). I also let them know on their Facebook book page and my comment was later deleted. An apology would have been nice along with a ""we hope you would consider giving us a try again"" instead of just, again, ignoring potential future customers. I'm from Arizona but am not currently living there because my husband is in the air force and is stationed in Idaho. I will not recommend this restaurant to any of our friends or service men heading that way because of their sheer lack of consideration of their patrons. I do not want to lead them to a bad experience when there are plenty of great places to eat in phoenix that do not need the help of a ""as seen on food network"" sign to attract business. (We ended up at Tomaso's in Phoenix with great customer service and delicious food!)"
1,"Last night was my first visit to George and Dragon....and unfortunately, it will probably be my last.  My boyfriend, my daughter and I decided to go there for FATHER'S DAY.  We walked in the front door and stood in the middle of the room facing the bar.  There were maybe 6 or 7 occupied tables--it wasn't busy.  So we stood there, unsure of wether we sat ourselves or waited to be seated.  3 servers were present as well as a blonde bartender who totally ignored us.  Finally we asked if we sat ourselves and the bartender said to go right ahead.  We picked a booth facing the bar and sat.  And sat........and sat......and sat.  One male bartender seemed to be working in a back room only.  Another girl stood alongside the bar, staring out @ us, drinking a soda as we sat there with no menus.  The bartender, who was maybe 15 feet from us, would look @ us sideways, and look away.  My boyfriend works for the City of Phoenix.  He's a HUGE tipper.  Maybe we don't look like much, but...??????? We waited 12 minutes (I am a server/bartender myself, so I watch greet times closely).  Finally we stood up and walked out...walked RIGHT past the bartender and she never said a word!!!!!!!!!!  I did call a spoke to a managernamed Bill, who sounded shocked.  I hope he took care of the problem or they will lose a LOT of business =(  We ended up having a very nice Father's Day dinner @ The Black Forest Mill...thumbs up to them!"
1,"I have yet to walk away from this Barriques location NOT disappointed. Horrible, horrible, horrible service. Slow, unfriendly staff who refuse to even talk to you sometimes! I have the unfortunate fate of working in the same business district as this location, and it is the ONLY coffee shop within a reasonable distance. I now drive 10 minutes out of my way to work to get coffee and breakfast because I refuse to give those people any of my money. Please stay away from this location - this warning comes from a girl who has NEVER written a bad review of any place! Boo Barriques! :("
1,"This place has gone downhill since the last owner, Mike, sold the business. Gone are the days of amazing food. The new owner is an a*shole, and the food is terrible. My three year old can make a better sandwich. Will never order again."
1,"Walgreen's=crap.  This particular location has me convinced to avoid Walgreen's altogether for matters of convenience.  Poor service in the pharmacy is common.  This is strange for a place that was built around the pharmacy business.  Pharmacists here=decent people.  The pharmacy techs=overpaid, spoiled pains-in-the-asses.  They consistently act as if they're doing you a favor by filling your prescription for you.  The vagrants here are also a problem  Just drive to new CVS down the street or wait until real stores are open for convenience purposes."
5,Marsala spaghetti-nuff said!
1,"Absolutely terrible, and dangerous!!  Manicurist cut my cuticle and then cut Herself somehow. Didn't see a thing wrong with it. No apology. She didn't put on a glove!! She simply said ""it happens"". Unbelievable! I do not want a bloodborne disease from a salon and if you don't either stay far far away from this place. She was so casual about it!! Also, I left with polish all over my skin and a French manicure that would have been dine better at a $10 Korean nail salon."
1,"Seemed convienent.. owner is rude- really rude and angry.  Her daughter seemed nice though- but she wasnt the one working on me- the owner was.  She cut my toes to the point of bleeding- not once, but three times. She scrubbed my heels- but not on the part that needed it-on the soft skin, so now I have red, raw skin. I turned down the massage, which is saying a lot because I love massages.  Next day I have an ingrown toe nail on the left big toe. I agree with Jenn- stay far away from this place.  I recommend VK Elle Nails at Central and Camelback in the uptown plaza- I have been going there for years and they are wonderful. Worth the extra few minutes to drive!

Epiloge: I got a terrible infection on the toe that I thought was ingrown. Dirty."
5,An Arizona elite institution.  High academic and artistic standards. Quite challenging for students. Teachers are unusually highly communicative.
1,"OK I hated it! I have eaten Mexican food all across North America and this is by far the worst! Seriously I would prefer to eat at Taco Bell than return here!
 
The building is all they have going for them. 

Service is mediocre. If you read the menu you will see at the bottom that they will not split checks for a table and a few other will not rules! Come on people, how tacky and inhospitable can a eatery be!? My waitress was some young girl. She was okay but obviously not to experienced. 

My food, left me dumb founded! I was having lunch. I ordered the steak fajita $11. It was a big meal with rice, beans, guacamole, Pico de Gallo, the fajita had lots of colorful peppers w/ onions and mushrooms! Never have I had mushrooms in a meat fajita, but okay I'll go with it. Then I bit into something that set my mouth a blaze! But beyond all that the food was SALTY! Yes the rice and beans as well! I could not eat it. I set there contemplating my hunger, what set before on the plates and the girth of my waist size, or to doggy bag it for my hound - I was ready to walk away when the waitress showed up and noticed my plate. When presented with the idea of a to go box, I broke down and told her it was to salty. She kindly offered to get me something else. Off the top of my head I said a chicken enchilada. It came out, and it was even worst! When asked if it was to my pleasing, I told a bold face lie! I said it was better, only meaning it was not as salty. Then I asked for a small sour cream, to cover the taste up in an attempt to make it look like I had eaten more of it then I intended. I picked at it but left more than half of it on the plate along with the sour cream (2 Tablespoons) that they charged me $2 for! 
I wanted a Sangria but opt not to attempt that recipe after experiencing the kitchen's recipes. Besides $7 for a glass of Sangria was a bit steep in my mind as well. 

If you know me, you will soon learn I love a happy hour. I read their happy hour brochure and was not impressed. Basically half price on chips & two different dips and $5 drink specials. I'll pass on this as well. 

Wild horses, horny handsome straight men, nor hunger or thirst will get me to return to Ajo Al's or recommend it. 

Oh and it's not cheap for lunch nor dinner either, considering it's Mexican food and awful. Sure glad my Uncle Al could cook better than this."
1,"Absolutely do not stay here! This hotel has bed bugs! I came home with over 30 bites all over. The front desk did not seemed surprised at all when we asked about the bed bugs. We have yet to receive a refund even after contacting corporate customer service. The hotel is dirty, the staff is not too friendly and the hotel is across the street from a strip club.

I would give this place zero stars!"
1,"My wifes combo was okay but my sandwich was so tough I could not eat it! The check out lady kept  tweaking like she was on something.
My wife may go back but I never will! I could see while waiting they got some orders wrong and just dumped the food back into the pot in the kitchen!"
5,"Great local diner, that features lost of creative dishes-like zucchini pancakes.  Awesome bakery and great, home cooking.  While i'm prone to go with breakfast items, the lunch offerings have also always been good.  I don't think you can really go wrong here.  Decor screams old-time diner, maybe even at the expense of feeling a little bit forced.  All the same, this place should be a regular stop for anybody in madison."
1,"Unless you want arrogant PA's telling you what the plan of action is instead of a Doctor, I would not recommend this place.  Ego's the size of a planet.  Dr. Lederman was great, Dr. Cummings and his assistant were not.  I do not hero worship doctors."
5,"Saw a concert here, a Disney show, and a couple of basketball games! Love the spacious venue and every seat In the house seemed like a good seat! Staff is helpful when looking for an exit or the bathrooms, concession is pricey but what do you expect from a big arena like this one? I enjoy coming here, parking is a breeze, wether you park in their garage or an outside lot, it's easy to find and cheap!! :) can't wait for the next event I come here to see!"
5,"Next to Chick-Fil-A, Culver's is my fav fast food chain.  Rarely is a snowboarding trip complete without Culver's to top off the day.

The butter burgers hit the spot (though mine was heavy on the red onions; good thing those are easily removeable), and the fried cheese curds are to die for.  You don't find those floating around just anywhere.  But if there is anything you MUST get, it's a cup of the frozen custard.  Damn, that's good stuff."
1,"Well, I went there earlier tonight with my boyfriend. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and soft taco. He ordered the #6 combo, which is the beef chalupa w/a hardshell taco. The inside of my quesadilla was cold and barely had any chicken in it. I was very disappointed. My boyfriend's chalupas had barely any meat in the inside and it was the same for his hardshell taco. I would expect better service and better preparation. We waited an awfully long time about 15 minutes. I don't recommend this place to anyone. The Taco Bell on East Washington is far better."
5,"*nom nom nom!*  Mm, this place is the perfect eatery for a lazy Sunday, or if you are skipping school or work as it's quite naughty.  One of those mimosas and bloody marys in the morning kind of days.  The Garfield is extremely satisfying and the french toast in a cup is genius, if a bit sticky.  But since we are being naughty eating here a little stickiness is probably appropriate!  It is tiny tiny, but I find it amusing rather than annoying."
1,"No free WiFi, you have to go outside to get to elevators and corridors to rooms are outside as well, which is a ridiculously bad idea in Phoenix's 100 degree heat. Trash in corridors as well. Hotel restaurant is poor as well"
5,Love me some A&W.   Best fast food out there and there needs to be more of them!
1,"All I can say about Fate is 'yuck' 

That's it."
1,"We went to the location on Scottsdale Road last night. My husband went to one in Minneapolis a week ago and raved about how good it was and he wanted to take me to the one here. We were very disappointed in our appetizer and meal. We ordered the scallops entree for our appetizer and they were sandy. Our steaks were just okay and the crab I had on my Filet Oscar was very strong. I am hoping it didn't come out of a can. Our side was creamed spinach but it should have been called garlic spinach because they put a whole bulb of garlic in it. I LOVE spinach and I couldn't eat it. 
I had high hopes of a long over due date night with a delicious meal but we were let down. We won't be giving this restaurant another try; too many mistakes for the price."
5,"One of my favorite places, delicious food that never disappoints. Best fried chicken sandwich!!!"
5,"Unbelievable.      Fantastic experience all around, including the wonderful waiter Ruben who was willing to work with my vegetarian preferences.   My husband (not a veggie) reports that the fish he ate was unbelievable.   And a half dozen mexican beers on draft.  So good!     I can't wait to go back!"
1,"I love cuban food!  And so I take every chance to eat it, so when I saw a cuban very close to our hotel in Scottsdale, I was there!  Unfortunately, the minute I walked in, I should have turned around and walked right back out again.  There was a distinct smell that wasn't clean and wasn't pleasant.  But my interest in  a good cuban meal got the better of me.  Big mistake.

The food was definitely sub-par.  I had the sampler, which included pollo cubano, ropa vieja, and masas de puerco.  Unfortunately, none of the dishes was particularly flavorful, and none were good renditions of the dish.  The pollo was bland other than an overly acidic sauce, the ropa vieja was just lacking in flavor and the vegetables and broth hadn't been blended together, and the masas weren't crispy in the least.  The whole meal was a huge let down."
1,"I had not taken my family to RR in quite some time.  Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.

Our entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.

The fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, ""No, I already got this half full bowl.""

A few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entrée.

$58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?  No thanks RR.  We won't be back."
5,"Wednesday night BINGO is a BLAST. My friends and I go every so often and have so much fun. Cheap food & drinks - plus tons of great people watching and of course - the occasional win! Overall - really cheap, hilariously fun entertainment. Dobbers are $1 each, and cards range from $6 - $18 depending on how many squares you want."
5,"love this place !! myfav bartender is samantha shes quick with a joke and to light upp your smoke :), amy is pretty good bartender as well . great place catch drink any night of the week"
5,"This place was recommended to me as some of the best Chinese food in Madison.  Totally agree!

I went here for a Wednesday lunch at 2 pm and I was the only person there.  I don't mean to be stereotypical, but if you've ever walked into an empty Chinese restaurant in the mid afternoon...you're probably going to have to make your presence known by ringing a bell or yelling an awkward ""hello"" towards the kitchen.  Not in this case, I was promptly greeted and offered to sit anywhere. 

My food was excellent.  Nothing daring, just general tso's chicken. Good sauce, good flavor, good consistency.   

Lunch doesn't get any better at $4.95 which includes an entree, rice, and soup!

Summary: friendly service, awesome food, good prices.  I'll be back."
1,"I went here once for a drag king Contest. All the women were very over weight and not very entertaining. 

The bar itself is the size of a shack and it is definetly for an older male crowd.

If you are a lesbian between the ages of 21-35 this is not your spot"
5,"This place is as exciting as going to Disneyland if you're not used to Hispanic markets! The sights, the smells, the lights, the colors, and the chaos had my head whipping back and forth all evening. 

We started off with dinner in the cafe inside the market - just $5.99 for 3 street tacos, beans, and rice - and it totally filled me up. I washed it down with a Mexican coke in a glass bottle and it took me back to my childhood to the days before corn syrup became the norm. 

After eating, we took our time perusing the aisles and examining the foods foreign to us. They have a beautiful produce department and the prices were great on both the more exotic items like fresh papaya's to the staples like tomatoes and lettuce. 

The meat department is a carnivore's dream come true. Loads of fresh ground beef, pork, and poultry at very fair prices. I had to laugh at the ground pork in the glass case and wish I'd brought my camera. The butcher shaped it into a pig head - complete with a snout - and put cucumber slices for eyes. Not something I'd expect to see at my local gringo Fry's.

Shopping here was a real cultural experience tonight and I can't wait to tuck into the treats we brought home!"
1,"Bad service and even worse ""food.""  I'll never go back while in the area.  I'd rather eat McDonald's or at some other fast food place - they offer about the same number of ""healthy"" options. 

They get 1 star because of all the adorable old people there.  Other than a hospital/old folks' home - I've never seen so many walkers and oxygen tanks in one place!"
1,"Seemed like a nice place. However, after waiting in line for 20 minutes and taking quite a while to give our order (because it was VERY loud) we were told that it would take about 30 minutes to get our food. Not exactly what I wanted to hear after waiting 20 minutes but fine. When I try to pay I am informed that they do not accept debit/credit cards. Cash or check only!! No where on the door or while in line does it say cash or check only! There apparently is a very small sign on the register that says that but there is so much other crap posted in that area 99% of the people there probably never saw the sign. This is just ridiculous in this day and age to not accept cards. Even worse is the BS sign on the register. I will never eat here again just because of this!"
1,"Food mediocre, pastries days old, service lousy (3 other tables arriving after me were served first), dirty dishes, floors, windows, bathroom.  Place is a dump!"
1,"Just read CP's review and I must add my ditto to the 1 star rating.  Of late, I have also been disappointed with the baked goods at La Grande.  Particularly the TC sweets.  After my last visit, where the coffee cake was dried out and what I thought to be ""old"" and the 1/2 frozen cup cake, I said no more.  
I didn't even try to return it, because I felt the superiority vibe of the place and figured they don't need me or my dollars.  The only item they offer that is unique is the english muffins.  Sorry not enough in my book to bother with."
1,"This is really only a half-revue, because I never ended up eating here due to the following:

I got their menu in the mail and it looked good, so I went to see the place. The building exterior should have been a big red warning, it was grungy. Walking up to the front door you notice the absolutely filthy windows that are so dirty and smeared you cant really see through them. I went in and noticed all of the pealing wall paper and filthy floor corners and table feet, then there was the terrible smell permeating the place of rancid fishy frying grease, it almost made me sick--I had to leave.

 This place is dirty!  I have worked in food long enough to know that if the front of the house is this bad then the kitchen is going to be ten times worse. These people clearly have scraped this place together to try and make a buck and nothing else.

I find it mind blowing that this ""restaurant"" can even get a passing score from the Dane Co. Health Dept."
1,"Not a service friendly place. We came in with a group of five to sit at a table surrounded by waitresses who where standing around by the cashier talking, while another waitress sat with a couple of guys. We waited for about 20 minutes and still not one of the waitresses offered us water or any kind of service. I raised my hand hoping to get one of the girls attention and still nothing. We waited a couple more minutes before we decided to go to Tilted Kilt a few blocks away at City Scape. This is not the first bad experience I've had with Hooters but that just solidifies my decision on not visiting Hooters again."
1,"We went to lunch here for the first time after passing by it 100s of times, we went on a tuesday afternoon at 12:30, it was busy but not too crowded. 

This place is NOT vegan friendly in the least, all of the sandwiches have some sort of dairy in them as do the soups. You can make your own sandwiches but I can make a sandwich with cold veggies or sauteed veggies with mustard at home. I would suggest offering grilled zucchini/eggplant with a sauce that is dairy free. 

All of the sandwiches are placed in sacks with plastic utensils and styrofoam cups, even if you eat in. This is not eco friendly, my pasta with marinara (which I can make at home) came in a nice plastic to-go container. While I realize this is not a restaurant per say, it would be nice if they had real forks/knives and plates if you plan to eat in and get something more ecofriendly than styrofoam. 

I did ask if they recycled before we left, and was told that the kitchen does, which is great! However, there is not a recycling container in the restaurant for the sacks/utensils or pasta to-go packages. 

I will not be returning to this non vegan friendly, non planet friendly sandwich shop and would not recommend it."
5,"This great family run restaurant is a fantastic restaurant-- authentic Chinese, served at bargain prices. The decor sucks, the lights are fluorescent, and there is a huge bill board in the parking lot. BUT, if you can look past some of its physical failings, the food is fantastic. Always dependable, always tasty. The menu is HUGE..."
1,"Marriott prices with Motel services-

As an airport Marriott I have a minimum expectation that the shuttle will handle a pick up within the 20 minutes stated at the front desk. Not so much here. Confirmed the shuttle should arrive in 20 minutes( it is a 6 minute drive to the airport from the hotel), and I waited and waited and waited. Only to be told to take a taxi. Could have saved me time but just telling me that in the first place. 

Next up, clean room is a pretty standard expectation when most are paying $200+ a night. Nope not here. Old elevator with disgusting stuff on the floor and stains on my chair in my room. Awesome. 

Finally, a hot shower is a pretty basic amenity. Not here this morning. Whole city block is out of water. Okay that's fine, stuff happens but when I call to inquire, at least offer a bottle of water or something to wash my hands or brush my teeth. 

I'm a Gold member so I had access to the concierge level. I attempted to work up there at 8 but the staff was obviously shutting down and didnt have any more hot water for my tea. 

Save your time and money and try another hotel."
1,"QDOBA on Central, Park Central Mall - 9/24/13, Tues @ 11:30 am... I was waiting in line for over 10 mins, when I finally got to the girl, she told we they we out of chicken! I don't eat meat or pork, so I ONLY wanted chicken. I flat out said, ""Good-Bye!"" to her & walked out,  as I was walking out, I made sure that I told everyone in line that they were out of chicken. I was very upset!  NO restaurant should ever run out of something like chicken! I would think that a restaurant would be or even should be embarrassed to be running out of a 'staple' such as chicken, don't you think? and the girl was so nonchalant about it, too."
1,"Visited them today to spruce up the Tacoma. Filled up the tank and chatted with the attendant, nice guy. Truck went through the wash. While in the drying line the guy that was supposed to be drying my truck spent more time flirting with his co-worker. He barely ran the rag around door jams. When they flagged me down, I walked around the truck. I asked if they were going to actually dry it  or was that extra?  Had to get them to finish washing the spots off. The windshield is still dirty. Had to remind them to put the antenna back on.   Could understand if they were busy,  but it was slow  This place is a joke. Wonder if the owners have any quality control in mind."
5,"My 2011 New Years Resolution was to find the very best mac n' cheese in the Valley.  So far, Cheuvront's is in the lead.  They have 6 varieties, and a wonderful trio option that lets you sample.  Adored the blue cheese, but I think the traditional was reallly the best.  Amazing play on flavors.  

Loved watching the light rail go by, and enjoyed the quiet atmosphere.  Thinking I need to take my dog for patio dining next time."
5,"Love this place! Whether you need a birthday plate with some odd candy on sticks, Pinata whacking sticks, Mexican Sun Hats or Non FDA Approved Drugs this is your place. I have found myself spending a good 30 minutes perusing stuff that any middle aged Irishman needs. I have pleased many family and friends with Pico Rico Birthday Plates!!"
1,"Just Brakes? More like Just Flakes. I went to this place in 2010 and it was horrible. Hopefully, it has improved since then."
5,"Probably the best chicken pad thai I've ever had. I love thai food! But this is the first place I've experienced the pad thai spicy...and might I say, it is amazing! The house salad was pretty good for a salad. The mango with sticky rice hit the spot...and fulfilled my dessert craving. If I'm ever in town again, I'm definitely coming back here!!"
5,Where else can you find a bargain cow head for $32!?!
5,"Another 18 months have passed since my last review, and this place remains unbeatable.  Ka, Raj, Lisa - they're all superb.  If you're looking for one of the best, no-nonsense, conscientious, and professional haircuts you could ever get, go here.  You could pay more at another place, but I guarandamtee you it won't be better.  

Huge thanks to Ka for sneaking me in today; he was busy and didn't have any scheduled openings, but a customer cancelled and he immediately called and got me taken care of.  I'll be a customer (and fan) for life."
1,"I'm sorry, but I just can't give a good review here.  I got two Travelzoo vouchers, which many would argue is an attempt to increase traffic when a business isn't thriving or is in its off-peak season.  

Some friends at work decided to make it a group outing.  There were 14 of us.  I paid $120 for four, so I could bring visiting family.  The original ""value"" of the meal is $240.  What a joke!  It says in the fine print that a gratuity of 15% would be charged at the restaurant on the original ""value"" of the meal.  Not true.  Gratuity of 20% was added to my bill at the end of the night.  This wouldn't be so bad if the server/bartender wasn't so HORRIFICALLY unfriendly, rude, and unprofessional.  Really, dude?!  You made over $200 for the 2 hours you spent serving us!  He would have made more if he had been nice.  It was made clear that we had bought discount vouchers, the gratuity was already included, and our service reflected that.  But guess what?  Those are 14 people that will NEVER patronize your business again.

Let's start from the beginning.  When you park, you are required to valet your car to the tune of $7.  Note to Geordie's.  Every other establishment in town that is doing well offers free valet.  

We arrived 40 minutes early to enjoy the views and a glass of wine on the patio.  I should have known when I went to order wine and was ignored for 10 minutes that the tone for the evening was set.  When I asked for a glass of sweet white for my dining companion and the bartender said ""we don't really have one"" I was officially turned off.  Naturally when we sat for dinner we were offered a wine list boasting hundreds (I think 650) bottles of wine.  Really?!  None of those bottles are white and sweet?  No riesling?  No gewurtstraminer?  

When we finally sat, the server ended up being that very same bartender, who made a huge deal about the check splitting and where we sat.  He actually cussed during the process.  So unbelievably unprofessional.  I have never felt like such an inconvenience at a restaurant.

We all ordered our meal from a pre fix menu of what appeared to be traditional Applebees fare.  When you title your poultry option at a fine dining establishment ""Corn Flake crusted chicken"" you have to know what you're in for.  The portions were decent but I had bland risotto and a confit of vegetables that turned out to be a cold, pasty, flavorless mess.  I tried the chicken bacause I typically order chicken.  It was cooked to chewy and also flavorless except for a mushroom ""sauce"" which I'm guessing came from a Campbell's soup can.

I ordered a bottle of Tempranillo to the tune of $77 which was decent.  Best part of the night, in my opinion.

At the end, the bill came.  $169.  I had already paid for the voucher, so naturally I thought it was a mistake.  No.  I was charged the $77 for the wine.  OK.  $62 gratuity.  That was hard to stomach.  That's 20% of the pre-discounted $240 meal and 20% of the $77 wine.  Sorry, the guy was a jerk and undeserving of 20%.  Especially since the fine print stated that a 15% gratuity would be charged.

The last $30 was tax.  $30 in tax!  Do the math, folks!  They charged me tax on the original $240 price of the meal.  Even though the sales price of the meal vouchers was $120!  I don't even think that's legal!  Charge sales tax on a prediscounted price?  Do you go into a store and buy a $100 sweater on sale for $50 and then pay tax on the original $100 price?  That was ridiculous.  Mind you, I had already bought 4 glasses of wine at the bar and tipped the (lousy) bartender for that.

Sorry for the lengthy review, but I'm gonna bottom line it for you.  I love  dining out.  In this economy, I understand that fine dining establishments have to nickel and dime you to survive.  But Geordie's is NOT fine dining!  It's actually quite awful!  All told, I spent over $300 for a really sub par meal and I was treated poorly to boot.

Get it together!  They either need to hire a real chef and provide a true fine  dining experience, or cater to a different clintele.  Although I can't think of anyone who would enjoy their food.  I would rather eat at TGI Fridays..."
1,"I really want to like this place. Their food is delicious - the crab puffs are addicting and melt in your mouth.

Unfortunately the service is terrible. It takes forever to get a drink at the bar on weekend nights, which is the only time to go since it is dead during the week. On First Fridays they don't take reservations past a certain time and then you have to put your name on a list. Each time I've put my name on this list they have crossed it off without trying to locate me, as I sit waiting for my party's name to be called right in front of the door. I then have to argue with the hostess to get back on the list to wait again."
5,"Wow!  You guys (the earlier reviewers) are prudes!  Naked statues shouldn't even get a mention.  This is a theater, not a Mormon temple.

The seating here was great.  Such a small theater that every seat is great.  (I was in Stage West i believe.)  The acoustics were great and the concessions were fine.  Not excessively priced, but still concessions priced.

Really?  Naked people get you guys that weirded out?!"
5,Old packer is now chiefs tavern. Cleaned up remodeled.great food and beer! Very clean.
1,"I've been to this location more times than I could ever count. It has always been my ""go to""! But $10 for a combo meal?! HOOOLY MOLY prices have gone up and absolutely nothing has changed!!! I truly cant believe how bad this place has become over the years. The young cashier girl was so rude. She was almost annoyed that we were coming in- to spend $24 on lunch! The peach cobbler was TERRIBLE. I had to scrap the bottom of the crock pot thing to get some extra BBQ sauce... I'm SO disappointed. Every time I go in it just gets worse and worse. There are so many other wonderful places to eat in downtown Phoenix. Honey Bears, you're just making it easier and easier to get else where."
5,"We've been bringing our two Treeing Walker Coonhounds here since we added the second dog to our family.  We'd been using a different, more expensive kennel when we had only one dog but needed a more reasonably-priced option with 2.  Hickory Hills has been fantastic for us!

It's a great value, our dogs are EXTREMELY high energy and VERY social with other dogs.  The play times while boarding are perfect and we know they have a GREAT time by how exhausted they are for 2 days afterwards!

We usually end the stay with a bathing.  Coonhounds have short, straight-haired coats but shed terribly.  Baths usually don't hold their good smell on our dogs for long, but usually with these, the smell lasts about a week and shedding is much better in the days immediately following their stay.  They do a good job.

One last instance of AWESOME customer service: we got stuck in traffic on I-94 today but had specifically departed early so as to make it to Suter's by 6 to pick up the dogs.  We knew we'd be late, called ahead to beg them to wait for us, and the girl at the desk agreed to stay 30 minutes after her shift so we could pick up our dogs tonight rather than tomorrow morning.  This has happened on two occasions.

The staff knows our dogs, their quirks and characteristics, and you can tell they love what they do.  We'll be bringing them here for YEARS down the road!!"
1,"This was the worst experience ever in a restaurant!

First, the service was lackadaisical at best.  It was very slow to have our order taken, and it took almost 40 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food. The food itself was tasty enough, once it finally arrived.

However, the worst part about this meal was the COCKROACH that we discovered on the wall over our table.  Immediately, my friend and I began to point at it and talk loudly. We tried to get the attention of waitstaff for several minutes.  Finally, the cockroach fell onto our table. That was it. We leapt out of the booth and exclaimed ""COCKROACH!"" Is this the worst part of the visit?  NO.  Waitstaff then came over, pulled back the table, squashed the cockroach, and then gestured for us to resume our meal and said ""Cockroach gone."" 

At least the manager comped the meal.  But,  if there is one cockroach allowed to crawl around the dining room TABLES, I can only imagine what the kitchen might look like. I definitely can't imagine going back!"
1,"We dropped by this place on a Fish Fry Friday which is a big night for Toby's. The place is so packed that they try to cut back on the time you take up at a table by having you order your food before being seated. You then stand around should to shoulder with other people who are waiting and you all have to work together to let the employees pass through. Our party was seated 20 minutes after ordering. 

My bland plate of fish wasn't something I'll come back for. I'm just too use to food with seasoning on it."
5,"Came here for dinner with the family and I loved it! I think I heard something about new management because you can definitely tell.. The service was outstanding, very kind and friendly staff! The food was great as well. The portions are more plentiful now!! Will definitely be coming more often and recommending it to all my friends!"
1,"I was in town for business and got back to my hotel around 7PM (dinner time). Having work to do for my client, I decided that I would order food to be delivered to my room and chinese food sounded great! 

I ordered General Tso's Chicken, a small Pork Lo Mein, and the fried dumplings. I thought I was in for a treat as I don't often get the chance to have chinese food. Little did I know, that the food about to be delivered from Taste of China @ 5415B Monona Dr, Monona, WI was horrible.

The chicken smelled a little different, but when i tasted it I could tell that it had been left out on the counter for hours instead of being in a cooler prior to preparation. The pork lo mein was OK, so I ate some of it and the dumplings were edible.

The next day, I was sick all day. I called the resteraunt and complained when I got back to the hotel and they offered to replace my order. No way was I going to go for round two of the food poisoning game. Instead I told them that I would be posting this review and reporting them to the health department. DO NOT EAT THERE!! YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY THAT YOU DID!!"
5,"Leaps and bounds better than other chinese food in the Madison area. Their lunch buffet is a great value. The general tsao's is to die for.

Don't miss out on this fantastic food."
5,"One of my favorite sandwich places since the early 80s...it's my NOONER stop any time I am downtown Phoenix, or at the Town and Country area...bread so fresh and such tasty sandwiches for all tastes."
1,"Well, I would love to have tried this wonderful food that I read about in the reviews, but I guess I never will.  King Solomon's Pizza lost my business on the first try by playing a game I absolutely cannot stand.

I ordered my pizza over the phone. I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes, to which I thought was pretty fast.  As the gentleman who was taking my order was ready to hang up, I said ""Don't you need my name and number?"". He replied that it wasn't necessary. That should have clued me in.

So, I drive over to pick up my pizza.  I walk in and I'm greeted by a couple guys behind the counter.  I let them know I'm here to pick up my pizza that I ordered via phone and go on to describe it to them.  One guy tells the other what I ordered, conveniently ducks out as the other guy THEN begins to make it. REALLY?

So I stop him and tell him why did I order over the phone if they had no intention of making it until I got there?  He looks at me and all of a sudden can't seem to understand English and goes back to making the pizza.

Nice try JERKS.  I tell him to forget it as I will take my business elsewhere.

Apparently this is done because they do not trust the customer to show up and pay. This same technique was used on me before a Chinese restaurant in west Phoenix. 

Fool me once shame on me. Fool me twice, screw you!"
5,"The employees here are fantastic! They're always friendly and sweet to me and every time I come in we throw a joke or two at each other. 
They always remember what I want and have it ready for me inside when they see me pulling into the parking lot. That is excellent customer service. I used to live in Coronado and would come in here almost daily. I was so bummed to move out of the neighborhood almost solely because Sunshine Market would no longer be pretty much across the street from me. I still make the drive once a week over here to pick up and few things because their customer service is so good and they have AMAZING deals on beer. I dare you to find a bodega in town with cheaper beer then they have. I DARE YOU!"
1,"I will never set foot in a building where my friends get assaulted. Every venue Snake! Snake! Snakes! has ever played will tell you they arrived on time, brought a good crowd and played a hell of a show. For them to be disrespected is one thing, and it would be enough of a reason for me to tell everyone I know to never put another cent into these people's pocket. But another line was crossed last night. I've played shows at a lot of the same venues as this great band, and I never would have thought any management anywhere would lay hands on the artists that bring business through their door. These guys deserve better than that. Phoenix, Arizona has always stood by Snakes! and we always will!"
5,"I've been here twice so I'll review both.  The first time there was a Tool concert at US Airways that night so this place was packed.  (Is Tool in a similar music genre to Alice Cooper?  I don't know.  Anyway...)  the wait for a table was long, but luckily bar outside served food and the line moved faster than I thought it would.  We ordered the Wildcat sampler and it was delish.  Their fries are and potato skins are crispy and flavorful.  Also, their prices are not bad.

Our second visit was on a Friday night.  Wasn't too busy, which made me happy.  Plus, our waitress was attentive and friendly.  The Mac and cheese was more like a penne with Alfredo sauce, but whatevs.  The food is all around satisfying and I'm definitely making Alice Cooperstown a regular place on my list."
5,"The hubby and I always default to Harmony Bar when we have a craving for a good burger and a local brew (even before noon). My favorite is the blue burger-a burger smothed in blue cheese and all the traditional toppings. The pizzas are worth waiting for-check on the days and times they'll make a pizza for you.
As always a smoke free environment is worth driving to Madison for."
1,"Service-Brand disconnect @Biltmore. Others have commented on the beauty and layout of this store, it's true: very nice. But recent experience not so great. 

Went in to buy a beautiful Chan Luu scarf in orange I saw a week ago. Couldn't stop thinking about it: a good sign I should buy it. It was gone. Seeing my disappointment, the sales woman offered to get it from another store. Perfect. She took me back to the ""behind the wall"" scruffy service area (wow, Saks, might need a paint job back there if you intend customers to see it), and proceeded to take my address info and credit card. At the end of the transaction, I asked her if she was sure she ordered the orange scarf. She assured me yes, although could not show me on the order that it was indeed the orange one. ""Well, it has to be the one they call 'melon.' There really was no other option."" Hmmm. Then, I noticed a $15 ""ground"" charge. This was a shock. ""I'm paying $15 in shipping?"" I asked. ""Yes, unless you use your Saks card, you pay shipping."" A) You've got to be kidding me, I would have gone down to Scottsdale Fashion Mall myself. B) You assess this charge without even letting a customer know that would be the case? C) $15 to ship a wispy scarf?  Not your best, Saks. Definitely a brand disconnect from a customer experience view."
5,"I took advantage of That's A Wrap for their catering services yesterday and once again, was totally impressed!  I called around 10am for a 5pm delivery... I wanted to make sure that those of us who were working at the Phoenix Art Museum all day preparing for the pARTy had some fuel to get us through the evening.  Sure enough, That's A Wrap delivered - literally and figuratively.  

I ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, and bottled water - it was perfect!  Everything was delicious!  It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating.  I had the ""Godfather"" wrap (Salami, ham, and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato, red onion, sun- 
dried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil).  I don't usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason, this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday - and it was!

Thanks That's A Wrap for fueling me and all of the yelper helpers for the pARTy... I'll be back to visit soon!"
1,"My husband and I came into this store on Saturday to upgrade our phones and to add him to my plan. We were put in the queue for a sales associate, and were then called over by a woman with blonde curly hair who basically refused to help us at all.

Here's what happened:
Unbeknownst to me my maiden name was still on my account, so when asked for my ID it didn't match up. 

Me -So how do I change my name on my account?  

Sale associate - Do you have anything on you with your old name on it?

Me - No, that's my old name, everything I have on me now has my new name.
So how do I go about changing my name on my account?

Sales associate - If you don't have anything with your old name on it, I can't help you.

Me - People get married all of the time and change their name, you're telling me I can't change my name on my account?

Sales associate - Not at the store level

Me- Fine, I guess I'll just figure it out myself.....

I then walked out of the store and called their customer number to ask them how to change my name on my account since, the Sales Associate in the store wouldn't tell me how. I was told I just need to bring my marriage license into a STORE, and they could change it there. Um, I was just told in the store that I couldn't change my name there, but I guess that was a lie.

The woman I dealt with clearly had no desire to help me. It's fine if you don't know the answer to something, but at least make the effort to find it out! I don't understand people that work in customer service, and totally lack it at the same time, isn't this your job?

Congrats for earning my first 1 star review!

If you need to go to a Verizon store, drive the 6 miles to the other one on 44th and Thomas where they actually will help you."
1,"Mediocre sushi and god-awful service. My wife and I, both ex-servers from our college years, tried them three times. Every time the service was infuriating and the food bland. Save your money."
1,The pharmacy here is the WORST!  In the last several months the service has gone down the tubes.  Routinely get the wrong medicine (and sit in the store for 10 minutes and listen to how many others this happens to)!!  Service is the worst too!
5,"It was a really cool environment and unique from the vast majority of the Phoenix area. We enjoyed their commitment to fresh and quality ingredients. Everything we ordered was delicious and reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly and prompt. 

HIghly recommend to come after dark in the summer because it is so blazing hot (mostly outdoor seating). We will definitely be returning for more pulled pork fries!"
5,"The Old Spaghetti Factory, was wonderful... Everyone I was with enjoyed their meal. Also the coffe was to die for. I will definitely go back when I am in the area."
1,"I like Dominos when I need cheap, delivery pizza for the kids after a long day and no one wants to cook or go pick up better pizza.  I was quoted 35 minutes for a delivery time on 2 separated occasions now and it actually took 70 minutes.  All i got from the store manager was this, verbatim ""Oh ya we got slammed and the pizza tracker doesn't really work.  I don't know why they even have that.""  What a bunch of inconsiderate assholes.  I will be getting my money back or calling my credit card company and declining the charges."
5,Great work at a fair price. I recommend without hesitation.
1,This is the worst Chinese food I have had could not even finish meal...ordered general tso's chicken with egg roll.  I do not recommend this place.
1,"I went to this salon for a 50 minute full custom facial. What I got was 25 minutes of steam in my face in a loud salon. My appointment was at 1:00 and, at 1:05 I met Dunia, who would be doing my facial. What happened in the next 25 minutes was this: a quick cleansing of my face, some gritty stuff applied and steam in my face for about 15 minutes, a bright light in my face without my eyes covered and a rough rinse off of my face, some really strong (she said it was antiseptic to ""kill bacteria"") stuff applied to my face, followed by sunscreen ... that was it. Oh - and all of this WITH THE DOOR OPEN ... and let me just say it was not quiet in this place (aka: NOT relaxing). I walked out of the salon at 1:30 wishing I hadn't wasted my time and money for something I could have done myself at home."
5,"Truly Great Performances in an intimate theatre setting by wonderful casts and a theatre staff with a very strong Customer Orientation.
We have been season ticket holders for years and there is no better season ticket in Arizona."
5,This place rocks!! It's all about empowering women...non-profit service all about women..check it out!
1,"Attention expectant mothers: DO NOT USE!! I was referred to Southwest Women's Care by a friend who was very impressed by the Ahwatukee office location and staff. This being my second pregnancy, I was prepared for the lengthy initial paperwork, long office waits, and moody receptionists; however, I was not at all prepared for complete and utter incompetence. I left my initial visit feeling ok with my OB selection, but in all honesty, I wasn't super impressed with the doctors or staff.  I rationalized the lackluster feelings as pregnancy hormones and made follow up appointments.  If my friend raved so much about them then how bad could they be? I went through my new patient information packet and realized the PA who examined me failed to provide me a due date. Wow! Completely unbelievable! Everyone knows it's one of the most important components of the initial visit. I was able to figure it out using a pregnancy calculator but I couldn't believe the miss. 

During my visit I also set the expectation I would need FMLA paperwork filled out by 5/29/13--I stressed the importance of the forms and deadlines. The person assisting me said that my deadline wouldn't be an issue and assured me she would personally complete the forms if needed. Well, when I called this morning (5/29/13) to see if the forms were completed the receptionist seemed uninterested in my situation and chose to inform me they had ""7- 10 business days to complete any and all medical forms . . ."" to which I responded ""that is not what I was told at my visit and I need those forms as soon as possible."" She told me she would check into it and call me back. 
 
The receptionist did provide a prompt follow up call to let me know that they would be making an exception for my forms. She set the expectation that I would be able to pick them up after the office lunch break and left it at that. I was pleased with the quick response and went to pick up my forms as soon as I could. When I got to the office the front desk could not locate my paperwork and the lengthy wait time left little time for me to double check the forms. Imagine my dismay when I got back to my office to discover the forms were filled out completely incorrect.  There were contradictories, wrong information, and misspellings galore.  There is absolutely no way a medical professional could have completed the documents. When I checked the back signature, sure enough, it was different from the rest of hand writing on the forms.  I am completely appalled that a doctor or physicians assistant would sign off on forms without insuring they were filled out appropriately. 

There is no way I would let someone who can't even take the time to make sure basic documents are completed properly deliver my child.  An expectant mother needs someone who pays attention to details. If this is how they handle the little parts of pregnancy then I don't even want to think about how they handle the bigger parts. I urge ALL mothers to reflect upon this information when considering Southwest Women's Care as their OB of choice."
5,"The moment you walk in you are transported into another time and place. They had live music that fit the scene, made the atmosphere, and stayed background enough to have a conversation - check it out Tuesdays through Saturdays.

Order the pecan catfish with the crawfish BBQ on top, aka ""Maria's special"". It sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish. The tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable combination but it is soothing, hot soul food at its fanciest. Everything we ate had depth, richness, and finesse. If you are a soup snob, definitely get the soup over the salad option. Presentation was lacking but I don't think that's the point of soul food.  

Service is sassy but whole-hearted. We walked in without reservations at 7pm on a Friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told ""yeah, if you can find seats"".  We found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar. It isn't bend over backwards service, but they are real people and sometimes that's better. Maria, our bartender who's worked there 13 years, gave excellent food and drink recs and was really attentive despite the rush - she basically made our night. 

It's a great place to bring guests if you want to head off to a chill and unexpected place. Even better if you're prepared to stuff your faces with well-executed comfort food. Try the Sazerac if you want a stiff, sweet drink and the Hurricane if you want a fruity, refreshing beverage that punches like a Long Island. The crowd here is mature and casually well-dressed."
5,Brought in my 2012 Passat TDI for its 20k service and received excellent customer service as usual. I even had a last minute change in my schedule that was handled smoothly.
1,"Extremely disappointed.  I have frequented this Rubio's for years.  

On my last visit there ever, I  watched every second of the near Halloween horror:  my carry out order was brought to another table, to an elderly couple who were obviously dining in.  When the front counter guy asked if they were carrying out, they said they didn't care.  

I watched them open the carry out boxes.  I watched them take the boxes to the salsa counter.  I watched them take a bite from the boxes.  I watched them shut the boxes when the counter guy realized that he brought them the wrong order when their order was finally ready and called out at the front counter.  

I WATCHED IN HORROR AS HE RAN OVER TO THEIR TABLE AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY RECEIVED THE WRONG ORDER, AND HE CLOSED  THEIR BOXES AND BROUGHT THEM TO MY TABLE AND HANDED THEM TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was.....horrified.  I was in shock.  I said:  um, I'm not taking that if they put stuff on it, and I know they put stuff on it and took a bite.  
 
The counter guy opened up the box and said, I don't see any stuff on it.  it is fine.
He closed the box and handed it back to me.  
 
Another customer walked passed me and I glanced at him in horror, hoping to get some kind of compassion and sympathy.  He stared back at me with no emotion.
 
I turned to the counter guy and said, I really don't want to take the boxes if they put stuff on it.  He says, I don't see that they put anything on it.  It's fine.  And he laughed.  It doesn't matter to me if he laughed at me or thought it was funny, but it was NOT funny.
 
I walk out of the store DAZED and IN SHOCK with the two boxes.  
 
Never in my life, even in the dirtiest grossest restaurant have I blatantly experienced anything like this.
 
When I got home, I opend the box to microwave the hell out of the plates thinking I would give it to my dogs;  and there was a foot long hair EMBEDDED across both tacos which I slowly pulled out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! 
 
I can not even make this S*IT UP!!!!!!!
 
I will never, ever go back there ever again.  Good luck suckers.  I hope you take your Cipro. You get what you pay for.   Never ever again.  
 
The only plus was that it was free taco weekend, and the counter guy gave me a free taco, which I threw away after gagging pulling out the embedded hair.  
 
For years, the service was friendly and excellent.  What happened?  :(
 
I'm on my way to Baja Loco."
1,"It pains me to write this review as Hillstone, formerly Houston's, has been one of my favorite places to eat for the past 20 years. The food and service have always been delicious and dependable. However, my last visit left me and my boyfriend with such a sour taste in our mouths, I am unsure we will return. 

We arrived on a busy Thursday evening, hoping to sit in the bar area. We enjoy the lively scene and people watching. We figured we'd have to wait a bit, which we have done on countless occasions. There was one seat available so I sat and we were greeted by ""Al."" Seemed like a nice enough guy, very friendly and quickly served us our first round of cocktails. We asked ""Al"" to keep an eye out for us as we were wanting to have dinner at the bar, he said, ""We'll get you seated, no problem."" After my boyfriend ordered his second cocktail, we noticed ""Al"" greeting two of his regular customers that had just walked into the bar area. He walked out from behind the bar and greeted them with handshakes. There was a small high top they sat down at, too small for dinner, but would do for drinks. As he walked back behind the bar to retrieve their bottle of wine, I saw him hold up two fingers to the other bartender. Within 5 minutes we noticed them sitting down at the other side of the bar where two people had just got up. After watching this all go down right in front of us, my boyfriend asked ""Al"" for our bill. He had a surprised look on his face that we were leaving, since we told him we intended to have dinner. I told him we saw what transpired with his other preferred guests. He quickly apologized and offered to buy us our drinks. When my boyfriend declined and said we would take our business elsewhere, he came out from behind the bar and continued to apologize and offered to buy us dinner. We declined and left money on the bar for our drinks. How could we enjoy a meal after he made it clear the business of his regular customers was more important that ours? 

Fortunately, we did end up having a lovely dinner down the road at Mastro's City Hall. The bar area was very full and we ordered a couple of drinks and waited for a spot to open up at the bar to eat. Our bartender ""Christian"" looked out for us and we were seated after about 25 minutes. We enjoyed an amazing steak dinner and were treated with first class service by ""Christian."" We will be back to City Hall, not so sure about Hillstone. Truly a shame."
1,Be prepared to be upset it is gone has been for several years now.
5,"Best Deli in the valley!
Best corned beef and pastrami I've had in AZ.
Like a Deli straight out of New York. Make sure you go Hungry because the portions are very big!"
5,"After an intense therapy session, I came to Wild Thaiger to debrief. 

They have lunch specials and bottomless french-pressed tea. The organic green tea is my favorite. Everything was very delicious and refreshing. The patio is the style of restaurants on Washington Ave, Miami Beach.

My 'Thai Spicy' green curry beef came out artistically and I took a picture. I saw other people taking pics of their food, as well. Who doesn't want to eat beauty?

The soup was fantastic. I doctored it up with mad jalapenos and dry red chili paste. My nose was snotting down my face.. 

Cultural note to the haters:
Thai people eat cockroaches as an after bar street fare. Jebus ppl! 
It's better than a bacon wrapped hot dog out the side of a utility van."
1,This needs no explanation.
5,"For being a gigantic venue, they really have their stuff together. All the staff know where everything is, management is helpful, and ticket scanners, seaters, and will call folks are all incredibly patient. Much love!"
5,"Visited with my family for first time. I have vegan diet and they don't, but we ALL enjoyed our meals. Will be back!"
5,"Absolutely one of my favorite bars. It's definitely got a neighborhood vibe, but it's chock full of some of the friendliest staff you'll ever meet. And can we talk about the burgers for a minute? They are wonderful. One of the best in Madison, in my opinion. There's a light, airy bun and a perfectly greasy burger with your choice of cheese and grilled or raw onions. I work nearby and it takes every chubby bone in my body to stop me from going there every day. Food is ready fast, and you'll always get a smile. Cash only, but there's an ATM. (The ATM is also super-speedy, which is odd and exciting. It's the little things)."
1,"Most definitely the dirtiest Chili's I've ever experienced, inside and outside. The patio had cigarette butts, a dirty ash tray filled with water from the misters, bits of trash strewn about. Inside tables were left dirty, the bathroom was filthy too. 

My food was cold and dried out like it had been made for someone earlier and then left under the warming lights.

Because I was in polite company and we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't sent it back.

I am quite shocked that I didn't get sick after eating there. 

Both the health dept and corporate need to make a surprise visit."
1,"Just returned from the Rockerij, we had a house salad that was mixed greens (Costco style) with 2 small pieces of tomato and croutons for $8.00!  Sorry folks this is not a salad this is a plate of lettuce.  $8.00!!  

 We ordered Prime Rib and once again we were disappointed, seriously the meat was tough and that ""melt in your mouth anticipation""  just didn't happen.   We walked out vowing never to return again.  If you are commancing high prices then provide superior quality.  As for service, it is a reflection of the 'lack of flavor, quality and true concern for patrons', everyone is too busy to concern themselves with the details.  

We dine out often, returning to places that once valued client, quality and service.  We will not retun to Rokerji,  Bummer, once upon a time the client, service and quality meats reined supreme.

Sharon G."
5,"A late night dessert run with my pregnant bestie led to a Monty's revelation:
They now serve (organic, classy) Sassy Cow ice cream, have even nicer and more delectable cheesecakes and their brownie sundae puts the Ella's Sparkled Kazoo to shame. 

Post-brownie sundae, bestie's baby to-be kicked. 

I think it was the hot fudge."
5,"Great collection.  Beautiful grounds.  Helpful docents (try and get on a walking tour it certainly adds to the experience).  I couldn't be happier with the Heard and the way they approach the subject of native SW cultures.  I am also happy how connected they are to the current cultures and issues facing native peoples of the SW.  It is not a large museum, and you can easily pound it out in 2-3 hours depending on your level of interest.  I also enjoy hanging out in their courtyard sipping a cool drink from the cafe.  
Highly recommended if you are in the PHX area."
5,"WOOOOO! I love this place! I'm a huge fan of the arts and I'm so happy that there's a theatre as great as this close to home! 

I was there last week to see bird cage (la cage follies)! It was a fantastic performance an I was trilled to come watch another show at this theatre. The actually theatre is pretty small. So small in fact that the orchestra is actually placed in a separate room on location and microphones transfer the live music out to the main stage. If you are sitting in the audience and look up you can see the director and lighting experts working their magic. The sound engineers are located in the back of the theatre which is the usual spot in most theaters. The seats were kind of uncomfortable but there was a person in the lobby trying to get donations for new chairs so I can't really say much about that.

During intermission I did have a slight problem with the pace the concessions were being sold. I tried to be patient because I knew they were having an issue with the credit card machine and the girl working was very apologetic but I felt like I was about to be trampled from behind by starving guests... But damn that cookie was good. 

I'm excited for this seasons performances! Especially RENT!!"
1,It was very disappointing to wait in line for one hour to buy a ticket for Body Worlds and then to find out at the ticket counter we'd need to wait over 2 more hours to get into the exhibit. Why no sign or greeter at the door to let us know that it would be 3 hours total wait? Big miss on their part and more than a few irritated people.
1,"For tax levys, late paperwork, and apologies after the fact, come to Sorge!  We had every penny in our accounts levied by the state because Sorge didn't do what they agreed to do in a timely manner.  In fact, they never did it at all, just ""forgot about it!""  Wife is 8 months pregnant and ALL of our money (thousands) we saved for the baby coming is gone!"
5,Very nice and clean place to have breakfast or lunch
1,Totally not what I expected. Watery bland sauce...
1,"HUGE disappointment!!!! Stopped for a quick dinner before a show. Ordered 2 burgers medium. They came out extremely well done & the buns were hard & dry. The waitress took them back to the kitchen & returned with 2 more well done burgers! What the heck?! When we told her (& showed her), she apologized & took 20% off the bill. We didn't have time for round 3. They didn't even send a manager over. $30 for an inedible meal. We will not be back. I'd recommend trying somewhere else."
5,Amazing everything. The crab wontons were  delicious. Everything was homemade and tasted great.
1,"Stopped into this branch on Thursday, Feb 17th. I drive past it all the time on the way to work and have long thought it would be convenient to do business at this location. The hours on the door indicated they were open until 5:30 and I arrived right at 5pm. The branch was empty with the exception of a few employees. I was greeted by one of the tellers. I explained my desire to apply for a loan and was directed to a young man named Anthony. 

Anthony could barely muster a friendly attitude. He was visibly annoyed to have to deal with me so close to branch closing hours. Immediately realizing his frustration I apologized for coming in so late and explained that I (like most people) have to work until at least 5pm but was able to get away a few minutes early to take care of some business.

One benefit to his eagerness to be done with me is that he flew through the process. I was literally done by 5:18. At which point his attitude improved significantly. 

The very next day I received a follow-up call from the Sunwest Federal Credit Union loan team. They needed some additional information which I was happy to provide. I'm not sure what it is about the folks at this Credit Union but again I got a huge amount of attitude. It was clear she felt bothered to have to deal with me. 

Ultimately I decided to take my business elsewhere. There are just too many other banks and credit unions that would appreciate my time and business. I'd recommend that you make a similar decision if good friendly customer service is important to you and your preferred banking experience."
5,"I love this place! Such an amazing place. Had a basil gimlet, my god!!! And Will, he and the boys behind the bar are such studs."
1,"I went in for a simple, everyday, ordinary haircut. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE (that's $273.00) later, I came home with products I just HAD-TO-HAVE pushed on me like drug dealers by everyone from the stylist, the shampoo girl, the facial girl, the counter girls, who just wouldn't take ""NO"" for an answer and are very well-trained to ""put you on the spot"" in front of other customers so as to embarrass you, and ""trick"" you into buying something you really don't need just to boost their commission sales. Jennifer hasn't the foggiest notion how to properly complete a man's haircut. She neglected to trim the sideburns, ear, nose, eyebrow, and neck hair, even though I asked her, to which she responded, ""We have people who do that!"" (for an extra charge!) and suggested I spend more money to have another girl wax these areas. WTF? Are you kidding me here? REALLY? On the lighter note, I am getting a so-called complimentary facial. Definitely a place where you should prepare yourself to be accosted by staff to spend more money!"
5,"Going to a Mallards game in the Duck Blind at Warner Park has become a summer tradition for me and many others.  When I was a kid I remember coming to many a Muskies game with my parents, but the crowds were always thin and no one was surprised when the Muskies and the subsequent teams folded.  Now Warner Park is a family destination as well as a popular party location.  For the last several years my company has held our summer outing here, tailgating in the parking lot before catching the game.  There always seems to be a huge crowd on the weekends.  

The Mallards organization provides an atmosphere that was missing when I was a kid.  Personally I love the game of baseball, with all of the intricacies of the pacing being a big part of the charm.  However, I realize that I'm in the minority here, because most of my friends find it kind of boring.  But the Mallards have really energized the park with the give-aways, the mascots, and all the other sideshows to the game.  My opinion is that if you want to see baseball played in all of it's old fashioned glory, go to Wrigley.  

The Duck Blind is the place to be for most of the adults that didn't bring children to the game.  For $25-35 it is all you can eat and drink in a sectioned-off area in the right field corner.  The food is pretty decent but the real attraction is the beer.  Led by local brewpub Great Dane's signature Mallards Ale, there is an excellent selection of beer.  This is undoubtedly why a lot of people attend, but it leads to a very festive atmosphere that is always a good time.  The only people not enjoying the Duck Blind are usually the opposing team's relief pitchers, since their bullpen is in the right field corner as well.  You can also win free tickets to the Duck Blind from US Cellular on the day of the game.  

Outside of the Duck Blind, the park is very kid-friendly, with various mascots running around and all sorts of things to keep the kids occupied.  The main mascot rides a zipline down from the party deck in the Duck Blind to home plate to start off the game and set the tone.  It's always about having a good time.  The various promotions include ""B-List Celebrity Fridays,"" various throwback nights and bands playing live music.  The concessions range from the traditional hot dogs, peanut and cotton candy to the truly excellent jambalaya.  The prices are quite reasonable and the people working are always friendly and appear to be having as much of a good time as the fans.  For the price there isn't much else you can find in Madison that compares."
5,"My wife and I went to see Les Miserables last night. I found the cast and production to both be first class. Immensely enjoying, my wife even cried during ""I dream a dream."" It was our first time at Phoenix Theatre and we will be back. The theatre provides a small, intimate setting which, in my opinion, elevates the overall experience. Did I mention FREE PARKING? If we had to pick only one favorite from the show, it would be Eponine (played brilliantly by Jenny Hintze). Her voice is amazing and my wife and I both loved her portrayal of Eponine. I see in her program bio that she has been in lots of productions and it is no wonder why. Thanks for a great first experience Phoenix Theatre, we will see you soon!"
5,"home of the infamous man v food bases loaded big unit hot dog...which we totally split! even with all the crazy fixings (and, not to mention the sheer size), this was an awesome hot dog!

but, the real dark horse were the sweet maple garlic wings! you have to try them...seriously! overall, a great sports restaurant/bar!

""BIG UNIT""!"
1,"Famous Dave's is so much better!! I use to go here all the time when i was growing up and i loved it, i don't know what happened but there food really went down the drain... the ribs are dry and black on the bottom and the fries have way too much seasoning. I think Jon needs to get back in the kitchen instead of spending all his time at the bar next door."
5,"This place is amazing for their lunch buffet! I love their mango chicken and banana cake! I'm not sure if it's just the food or what, but the Pepsi seems to taste different. In a good way, though. I usually hate Pepsi. The environment of the place is really relaxed. I love going here."
1,You get what you pay for.  The food is inexpensive but taste that way.  The only thing good is the bean dip and salsa that you get at the beginning of the meal along with hot corn and flour chips.  The rest of the meal is bland.
5,"Excellent service, friendly staff and you get to watch plans land and take off.  The food is great.  We've been here several times with our younger kids (just my husband and I and with extended family).  The wait has never been that long.  They work to get you seated as soon as possible if there is a wait.

Awesome diner food with daily specials.  Delicious, mouth watering diner food at diner prices.

They are open for breakfast, brunch and lunch.  Great family friendly spot.  Also great for a quick bite on your own.  

Highly suggest checking this place out if you haven't yet."
5,The theatre make-over is great! I really enjoyed RENT. Look forward to the Black Box Theatre shows.
5,"Mounds is the best pet supply store in town. It's more reasonable than the national chains and has a great selection.  They even donate their own food to the Dane County Humane Society, which is pretty cool."
1,This place does not even deserve one star. The place was dirty and the service stunk.
1,"I hate this fucking stinky ghetto shithole. My car was broken into here in broad daylight. There's always unsavory characters lolling about, and that's just the people that work there. They roll one distrustful eye up towards you (the other obscured by emo fringe) and glare at you for even daring to disturb them. As for the people that shop here, if you stand too close, you will probably catch lice and get exposed to tuberculosis in one shot. Every time I come here, without fail, there is some sorry sack of shit at the pharmacist counter, trying to convince them they just ""lost"" their written prescription for Vicodin, or their Percocets got ""stolen"", all with Emmy-award winning shows of anguish and pain. So you're asking now why I even come here, and I don't blame you. I work long hours, and this is the closest 24-hour pharmacy to my humble abode. Sometimes, a girl doesn't have time to  drive to a first-world facility. What can I do, except clutch my bag extra close, scared-old-lady style, and take an extra long shower with extra disinfecting soap when I get home."
1,"I go to this location fairly regularly and have never had a problem. Store is clean, employees are friendly, food is consistent. What more could I ask for? 

Until tonight. I get my order to go, the crispy shrimp plate. The girl working the register was really nice, and I was in and out quickly.

I finally get home and open my container. THE END of my good, reliable Ono experience. My shrimp are blackish/greenish/brownish...plainly, not something I am even going to take a bite of. (Gross!!!)

The store was about to close and I wasn't going to be able to drive back in time, so I called the store feeling like I should give them a heads up. I don't know if these things could make a person sick or not. (I do know I won't be the one finding out.) 

The girl that answers tells me, ""Yeah, that's how they've been turning out.""  Well, gee, that's great. Thanks for selling me something you KNOW is sub-par and far from edible. 

I guess I'll be going to Pete's the next time I want some fried shrimp, and that's a shame. I really like Ono's mac salad and the katsu sauce with the shrimp.

To anyone else thinking about eating here -

Maybe you should check your order before you leave. I'm sure this was a fluke and hopefully will be fixed soon, but I know how much I hate wasting money. And being hungry."
1,They did not make a great first impression and I don't think I will be back.  I took some friends to try Indian food for the first time. The service was not good at all. We had to go to the kitchen to get service for our drink orders. My friends enjoyed the food although I have had better.  But the naan was good.
1,We just returned from Embassy Suites 24th/Thomas . What a mess. Our room ( Suite # 331 ) was west facing and never cooled down below 80 degrees for two days despite the a/c unit running full blast for 48 hours.  Maintenance department was absolutely no help. Offered us two fans. This was the two most miserable day I have ever spent.  The west wall heated up around 1-2 pm and radiated extreme heat until well into the evening ( after midnite ). Avoid this Hotel except in in the winter.
1,"Worst customer service I've experienced in a long time. I was attending a meeting at ASU, when a Representative from Crave came in to clear out the pastries and catering items the conference contracted them to serve. When the Program Leader at the meeting asked the fellow a question concerning water; he replied with disdain stating ""that's not my job"". When she further questioned him, he proceeded to answer her questions in a very antagonistic way.

I had just bought a sandwhich from this place during our lunch break, but after witnessing this interaction, I have no desire to support a business that lacks a certain amount of professionalism. The sandwich was not impressive, so clearly I will not be missing anything over the next few days."
5,"Whhhhaaaat?! I have not reviewed these guys?! It's possibly because I was hoping to keep them my little secret. These guys took their Old Dixie food truck and took over this unique and eclectic location that has been home to other popups over the last couple of years. Inside seating is VERY limited 8 built in stools against a small counter. I love sitting inside but I often enjoy their out door seating during the summer and especially on these beautiful Phx winter nights. [They do lunch and brunch as well.] 

The Food: I have enjoyed everything I have tried here. They are known  for their biscuits, which are fairly large, sturdy enough to be used in their biscuit sandwiches but tender enough to enjoy with their homemade honey butter (the honey sourced from a small apiary in the neighborhood) or house made jelly/preserves or apple butter. Many of their veggies are often sourced out of the community garden when possible. They source locally as much as possible, and their menu adjusts seasonally, while keeping some of their popular favorites. They always offer vegetarian options and occasionally even vegan. [Skip the goat cheese on the beet tureen salad and that is a yummy vegan option]  
They make all food to order and honor substitutions or additions within reason.  Heck, for dinner one night I ordered their biscuit with goat cheese and smoked apple butter (found on the dessert menu) and asked if they could add bacon.  They gave me a bit of a raised eyebrow as they found the request unique and gladly served it up (and it was SOOO good) 

My favorites:
Anything with their fried chicken. 
Anything with their biscuits. 
Their french fries are  hand cut and fabulous. 
They smoke their own meats  (and sometimes apples for their smoked Apple butter) so try the Carolina or any smoked  sausage, pork chop, etc. that shows up on the specials board. 
Their burgers rock! (YOU HAVE to try the PB&B, well unless you have a peanut allergy). 
Their salads are lovely and tasty. 

They offer some select cocktails and a limited choice of liquor. But this doesn't matter because all you need to know is get a HURRICANE (or 3). You'll thank me later."
5,"The best lunch in downtown!
I recommend Downtown Deli to all my coworkers and clients that visit.
Being two blocks away has advantages.
Has a feel of big city mom&pop deli with the trolley steps from the front entrance. Historic pics on the walls.
Pastrami on rye is delicious.
SkySrapper is good on a very hungry stomach. It's big.
Chili goes great too.
Their fries are crisp and wonderful.
Don't miss lunch; they close at 3pm."
1,"Allowed them to hold my debit card here last night, and had $883 taken from my account today. I wonder if there's a connection."
1,"Called to make an appointment for a ""Complete"" car wash and was quoted a price.  When I arrived, the price doubled.  The salesman thought it was really funny.  The manager backed him.  I used to be a regular customer (four cars!) for many years.  Time to move onto another car wash company."
5,"Steps are a bit hard for us oldies but the food made up for it. Three of us, our son has been there before, thought mom and dad  should too..Started with mussels, and crab puffs, both were so good, we went through  three baskets of bread with them. The raspberry dressing on salad was a bit tart, my only complaint, and one had soup.I had the duck , which was super good, one had the seafood au gratin, and one etouffee...we were all pleased and all took home left overs.........We split a piece of the peanut butter pie...and one had coffee..we had a fun time drove 70 miles to get there."
1,"Yep Yelpers - I'm not ever going back here again. 

I asked the girl at the counter if they had Iced Toddy. Nope...no big deal. I asked instead for iced coffee with two shots of espresso in it. She said sure, no problem. 

What she handed me was A CUP OF ICE with two BITTER, BITTER, BITTER shots of espresso in the bottom. (That's not me being hyperbolic. I came home and made everyone in the house try the most bitter coffee concoction I've ever come across.) Okay so then she sent me over to the bar to the hot coffee. Melted my ice and my plastic cup. Not exactly what I meant when I asked if they had iced coffee... 

How much did this crud cost me?? A whooping $2.75. Oh, but wait! It's actually $3.00, an extra 25 cents for running it on my card, which she tells me AS SHE SWIPES MY CARD. I had cash on me. And I really would have preferred to be offered a choice to use it ahead of time. 

Also, their seating consists mostly of a long bar against the wall opposite of the coffee counter. You wouldn't be able to camp out here with a laptop, homework, or even a book. There just isn't any room. There's a few tables, but if a group walked in you'd have a major guilt trip. 

All in all, you'd go to Hava Java for a run and go coffee. And frankly, I never want to put that stuff in my mouth again. I don't see what this place has to offer."
1,"Not sure why I keep deciding to come back here. Rice is rock hard and has no flavor, along with most of the other food on the half-empty buffet trays. $10.50 for a plate of stale food and a drink that they forget to refill? No thanks."
1,"I do not think that location should decide if you get a big brother/ sister or not.  It's sad that where I live there's a 3 year waiting list.  Also the fact that they would not even allow the child to be brought to the volunteer to make it convenient is just ridiculous.  The gentleman even said that would be taking the volunteer away from someone in that community, as if the one we're in was not worthy.  Sad, especially for the children that really need the program."
5,"The red and green sauces have a gravy taste that complements the food, as opposed to being saucy, covering the food.  I had tamales carnitas in red sauce. The maza to meat ratio was perfect.  I actually ate the beans and rice that came with the meal.  They put cabbage on the top instead of lettuce, which made a nice crunch feel in the meal, and not just garnish.  
Do not expect a beautiful sitting area.  It's a restaurant grocery bakery place in downtown Phoenix, right.  

Wonderful."
5,"I can't really think of a metaphor that will really describe this place. My heart is really overwhelmed by the great service that I just had. This restaurant has a lot to offer, whether celebrating an event or not. They have a wide selection of wine and cheese and a unique and eclectic menu. They are here to delight all sorts of palate!"
1,"this place is unbelievable.  i have been a member for 5-6 years; i was out of the country and thought my membership was on a 6 month hold; the emptied my locker and instead of trying to contact me or send my items to my US address THEY THREW EVERYTHING AWAY!!!!

i lost $1,200 worth of things and the GM of the Camelback office offers me a waived re-instate fee that is $300 and NOTHING else even though I was on a 6 month freeze.

they threw my things out 4 weeks ago, i went in to find these facts out over 3 weeks ago, i waited patiently to hear from them, never did, so I called today and the guy who threw my things away said he was waiting to talk to the GM.  I told him it had been 3 weeks and you STILL haven't talked to the GM?!?!?!?!  he said no.  

avoid this place like the plague.  you can find as nice/nicer gyms at 1/10th the price."
1,"Bulldoze this place!  It's filthy...don't sit on anything.  Terrible service.  Actually no service.  We left after 20 minutes without so much as a glance from the staff.  It was nearly empty...easy to see why.

1. Dead
2. Over priced drinks
3. Disgusting bathrooms
4. The pool table is devoid of basic pool etiquette
5. Disappointing deals considering Madison is a college town
6. Bartenders are rude
7. This place is just dirty. 

Their so called ""Wing"" night....what a joke for .25 you get small wings that look like the chicken were diseased and on their death bed or they might just be baby rats."
1,"I don't know what ""Chicago style"" bar-b-q is, but if A&J's really serves it, I don't like it. The restaurant smells very good so I had high hopes.  However, the meat did not look very appetizing and tasted very dry.  The sauce is very, very thin, which I don't like. Sadly, I won't be going back."
5,"We have our bikes tuned up every spring from the friendly folks at Revolution Cycles, and have always been pleased with the service, quality, and value. Being able to walk there from our home is a plus, too.

A few years back, they even gave my wife a milk crate when we were having trouble finding one for her. Long story short, they're good people."
5,Many great dishes but the stand out for me: the freshie rolls! The best gluten-free spring rolls in Phoenix!
5,"Ace's employees have been incredibly helpful and nice every time I've gone to the store. The store itself is chock-full of great home- and yard-improvement stuff (tools, accessories, gadgets, etc), and the prices are very fair (especially when one considers the convenience of Ace's location and the idea of supporting a local business). For most of my small-to-medium-size home and yard needs, I'll skip the trip to Home Depot or Menards and stick to my neighborhood Ace Hardware."
1,"First, let me state that I never actually received a ride from this company. I've tried on two separate occasions, but their dispatch team has never allowed me to get that far and has MAJOR customer service issues. The only reason I've ever called this company is because their phone number is so easy to remember.

On my most recent call to the company (which just happened to be last night), I had to call from a pay phone because my cell phone battery died. Someone answered about 6 rings later and mumbled ""hello,"" no mention of the company or even the employee's name. 

I asked for a ride home from the Phoenix Public Library over on Central and McDowell, and the dispatcher asked for the address. I told him I don't know the address and he told me to ""ask someone for it."" I explained that I can't just walk around asking for the address because I'm on a payphone and there is no one within 30 feet of me. So he responded, ""Oh, well, I need an address to get a cab to you."" I ended up looking through a stack of torn up phone books searching for the address while he held a conversation with one of his co-workers. None of them listed the library address and the dispatcher hung up on me after a minute.

I called another cab company immediately afterwards and had absolutely no problem with them. The dispatcher didn't ask for the library's address (in fact, she stated it just after I told her where I was) and didn't hold a conversation with co-workers about weekend exploits. Never calling Yellow Cab again."
5,"The name of this place is deceiving! This is a really great (including tropical cocktails and non-alcohol) Caribbean sandwich, burger and appetizer place. Great variety of tastes and the caribbean chicken gumbo is excellent!
- Substitutes? No problem mon..."
5,"Look, I love this place and I don't want you to join. It's the antithesis of the meat market known as Princeton club. 

Sadly, smoothie bar/cafe is gone. 

Harbor is a really laid back health club that has everything that I need and more. The only downfalls are that it's super old and kind of put together like a corn maze.

8 years and counting!"
5,"Try the shrimp egg foo young.  It is the best ever.  The shrimp fried rice is great, good with vegetables.
Don't forget the bar.  A lot of people like to stop in.  The bartender is friendly, just like the show Cheers.  You can order and eat at the bar if you want.
The manager Rose is elegant and full of laughter.  No worries at this place."
1,"Sooo, is it normal for bike shop workers to be super smug? Seriously, you'd think I was interrupting them from their efforts at curing cancer. My apologies for my patronage and desire to spend money at your shop, it shan't happen again.

Also, I was quoted over the phone that a service would be $40, when I get there they say $45, but when I pick it up: $50. They said it would be easy to do, and I could pick it up the next day, but after going out if my way, nope...not ready.

Bottom line, I don't recommend this place."
1,"This place really needs an overhaul.  It really did not feel clean to me at all. Place was empty, but trash cans were overflowing and dirty.  The tables were not wiped off and there was meat on the floor.

With nothing going on in the place, why weren't the staff cleaning up?

The food was good, but with the way the place looks and feels, I wouldn't go back.

The owner needs to update this place, and soon!"
5,"I love this place, you are free to come in, plug in and play.  Greg is more than accommodating and is a human hard drive of info on vintage amps, guitars & pedals. Prices  paid on trades are fair as are the prices for the guitars and amps.  He had a very diverse inventory,  if your looking for a vintage Silvertone he's got it, or an echoplex, got that two, need a '72 Fender Princeton? Bet he has one or two.  Some crap but mostly real cool stuff.
I also love the store music system, 70's classic vinyl spinning on an old  stereo.  I think I'll go this weekend and see if he's got a Rickenbacker in stock.
No Bullshit sales lines, no pressure, just the straight skinny!  No ripoffs. 
Try it you'll like.  You won't be made to feel like a steaming dog turd like at Spruce Tree Music."
1,"Me and some friends wanted to get some lunch and decided to head over at this location. This was my first time there. We walked in and nobody greeted us at the entrance and we decided to walk over to one of the open tables. We sat down and waited for about 20 minutes for a server to come by and finally stopped one of the servers. I noticed that there were one bartender and two servers. The server told us that someone will be with us shortly. We were ok with that but it was not busy at all. then after another 15 minutes or so, I decided to walk up to the bartender and asked if we can get some service and at least get us some drinks. Finally, one of the two servers stopped at our table and took our drink and food orders. After she took our orders, we had waited close to 20 minutes and we didn't even get our drinks yet. We were there for almost an hour to get lunch and didn't even get our drinks. I got up and told the bartender that the service is bad and that we are leaving. We got up and walked away. I left this location with a bad experience and hungry."
1,EXTREMELY upset with the pharmacist Nicole.  Went and dropped off my perception tonight and she told me that I just filled it on Friday at another Walgreens. She was telling me that I can not double fill medicine. She didn't ecen wait for me to get to the counter she was sharing my business with everyone waiting for the tske care clinic. She just kept saying I can not fill pain medicine twice.  I called the other wslgreens I supposly filled at they said that was a perception from LAST year 2012 and that it clearly states 2012! She is very unprofessional and has NO customer service skills. Everyone waiting heard and was starring at me I  am sure thinking I was trying to fill the same perception!  I will never step foot into this store again. I suggest you don't either if you want to be treated with respect and not feel your some kind of scam artist! Bad thing os the other people are nice and friendly!

SUBJECT: RE: Thank you for visiting

Cassidy Cavin,
ARE YOU JOKING! EARN OUR BUSINESS? EVERYONE READ THE BELOW PRIOR TO GOING TO COULTER CADILLAC! 
As promised we came back to your dealership last night. Your New Car Manager, PAUL GLANS"" was very rude with us using the old scum bag CAR SALES tactics claiming he lost the key to the White Diamond 2013 Escalade Platinum which I spent over 2 hours previewing earlier in the afternoon. You were aware we were coming back last night? YOU AND THIS SCUM BAG waisted our time? I told you that my wife was a CFO and conducting Board meetings all week and we had a short window to buy the 2013 Escalade Platinum. We even called you to ask you to pull the auto out while headed there so my wife could see the auto which you agreed to do? PAUL GLANS (THE SCUM BAG) was insisting to walk around our ""trade in"" 2011 BMW 550i in advance to even showing my wife the 2013 Escalade Platinum?  Uhhh... this is 2013 not 1980? Flash-back??? I gave you guys the info on the trade earlier in the day including a pay off amount. This is horrible business. You and PAUL GLANS were cherry picking us which is a form of discrimination! EVERYONE READ THIS! This happens to be Coulter Cadillac, you and PAUL GLANS problem, not ours, as we immediately called Mike at LUND Cadillac who has inegtity and merrit and is dropped off a Platinum Escalade ESV Black Ice to our house the next morning. YOU LOST A SALE! Cassidy, we suggest you go to a more repitable dealer to work in sales capacity as long as that scum bag PAUL GLANS is working there. We also suggest PAUL GLANS crawl back into the hole he crawled out of as we are headed to all the online reporting sites to share this horrible experience with the Universe. PAUL, you can't discriminate, cherry pick and treat customers like this.  Question? Does the owner of Coulter Cadillac even know that PAUL GLANS treated us like this or is that scum bags trying to sweep it under the rug as if nothing happened? One thing is for sure, the owners WILL read about it. Go to your BBB page. Thank you, Valued Customer 

Dear Amy and David,

I sincerely apologize for what happened last night. I always want to give my customers first class service, and unfortunately you did not receive it. So if there is anything I can do to still earn your business and make things right or possibly your business in the future, please let me know! 

Thank you,

1,"No communication skills at all.  My wife and I went in there to simply have a piece of glass cut in two and they said they didn't know when they could get to it... They had no clue if they could store it there until they could cut it, and they offered no options.  We went to Roadrunner Glass about 5 miles away and they were GREAT and less expensive!"
5,"Big scary Grand Avenue has the best kept secret ever- the Paisley Violin. 
I've been visiting the Paisley since it's days on Roosevelt street, and it's easily one of my favorite spots in the city. 

Everything about the place is just good- the people, the atmosphere, the food. The International Eggwiches- egg sandwiches on a bagel- are great for breakfast; any of them will hit the spot nicely. Lunch is always a tougher choice because there are just too many good things on the menu. I am particularly fond of the Hummus plate and the Paprika turkey sandwich, but most everything else has been amazing as well. (I'd stay away from the Champs d'Elysses sandwich though, it's much too heavy on the brie) The daily iced tea is always unusual but usually good, and the soup of the day is never subpar. The last time I was there, the not-so-traditional potato soup was heavenly. 

The coffee and espresso are great, although I can't say too much about the frou frou drinks because I don't drink them. I imagine they'd be great too, with as good as the coffee is. 

Go...eat...you won't regret it...and on your way out, pay a visit to the Paisley pigs in the back. That's right, there are two little pigs residing at the Paisley, and they're pretty cute- for pigs."
1,"The Dem party in Arizona is truly wonderful. They push issues that need to be pushed and stand behind their arguments, which by the way, always make sense.

These people are doing a fine job running our state and should be lauded as genuine people, willing to do the right thing."
1,"Avoid this pharmacy especially if you are on any critical medications and can't risk errors and/or long delays in getting your prescriptions refilled. 

CVS seemed like a safe option after my insurance plan and Walgreen's parted company, but has proven to be anything but. It has now taken seven different attempts to get a simple prescription refill, one that was easily filled correctly the first time at Walgreen's with no issues. 

CVS has said it was ready when it wasn't; filled it with less medication than the prescription specifies; argued over what the prescription calls for;  told me on one visit that it was not covered in my plan without even checking; finally recognized they had not done it correctly and said they would; notified me it was ready to pick up and then called back to say oops, they needed more time to get the rest of it in; notified me that the new version was ready for pick up only to give me the old, incorrect version and  then go to the back to find the newer version of it, which I purchased, only to find they had gotten closer to being correct but had once again shorted me on the medication. 

I have cancer, and the time and energy it has taken to deal with this one prescription has been very wearing. Fortunately this is not a life-saving medication, but if a simple prescription is handled this badly I would not trust the people working at this pharmacy to handle a complex one. Additionally, the majority of the individuals that I have encountered have been rude and curt, with no real interest in serving the customer."
5,"The Speckled Hen Inn Bed & Breakfast really is as good as it gets. My husband and I stayed two nights in the Heywood Hardy Suite, which was stunningly clean and beautifully appointed. Seriously -- you could eat off the floors, that's how clean it was! The four-poster canopy bed was super comfy and luxurious.

The premises were gorgeous, just as advertised. We admired the sheep and the llama and the chickens as they did their thing in the pasture. Happy, the goldendoodle, was a fluffy and friendly and fabulous co-host. And Pat and Bob -- the innkeepers -- are amazing cooks! The baked plum, scones, and farmers' market strada were superb.

Next time we are in Madison, we will definitely be staying at the Speckled Hen Inn! (And you should, too!)"
1,"Thought I should update my last experience concerning the volunteering situation at Ballet AZ.  I waited a couple of years and went back and offered my services.  Must have been my instincts because i delayed sending them the paperwork.  Just as well because I was told soon after they ""rescinding"" their offer to have me do volunteer work with them???  This happened awhile back now, but last I heard the same people are handling that area so doubt if things have changed any.  

You be the judge"
1,"What is up with crappy customer service in this town?!?  I am giving this place 1 star based on the fact that my dinner companion and I couldn't eat more than 1 bite of the Mahi curry dish because it was so hot.  Don't get me wrong, I love spice, we have a multitude of hot sauces, chili paste and spicy oils in our home collection.  My companion loves, loves, loves things spicy, but when we both take a bite and can't actually taste any flavors of the dish, just burning lava, well it is simply to hot.  When we called our server over to let him know that the dish was way to hot to be palatable he asked if we wanted it boxed up.  Um no, please just take it away.  He didn't even ask if we wanted something different.
Here is the kicker, when he brought our check the dish was still on it.  I called him over and asked for him to remove it for the obvious reason that we sent it back.  His response, ""Ohhh sorry!  It does say spicy on the menu.""  I couldn't believe it.  I got charged $14.95 for a dish we couldn't even eat.  Totally lame.  A manager didn't even come over to try to smooth this issue out.  I left nothing for the tip considering they were ok to rip me off.  I won't be back."
1,"Was not feeling well yesterday so I ordered some food online for delivery from Chang Jiang.  Originally I though I had enough cash to pay for the order but realized as I was finishing my online order I'd have to pay by credit card.  I took the $23 and threw on the table next to the door so I could tip in cash. When the guy delivered,BTW he was in my neighbors driveway about 2 feet into his lawn, I grabbed what I though was a $3 tip.  Woke up this morning and realized that I had given him $23 instead of 3.  I forgot to remove the $20 bill when I handed him the cash. I didn't look at it, like I said, I was sick.  I called this morning to and began the conversation with him like this "" Hi, you delivered food to me yesterday on ____ St. and I think I may have mistakenly given you too much for the tip.  He started yelling in to the phone that I gave him a $3 tip not a $23 dollar tip.  He was ranting and raving.  The weird part is that I had not even said the amount I though I had mistakingly tipped him. I was talking calmly and he was ranting that I also had stolen his pen from him(a 20 cent pen!)  
Why would someone react like that to a simple inquiry??I was not accusatory, I was simply inquiring.  And then for him to say he wanted to come over and pick up the pen I had taken from him? WTF?  
Ever heard of Karma dude?"
1,This review pending a post-event phone call to air grievances.
5,Pacifico on tap! This place is great! They keep it real and the food is great! Kinda old inside but worth going there to eat for sure.
1,"I am NOT surprised that this store is the lowest rated in the area.

Excuse me, I have a return.  It's unopened but I bought it more than thirty days ago.  I DO have the receipt and you still sell the product, Linksys router.

Mgr:  I'm sorry.  We do not take returns over 30 days.

Me:  If I didn't show you the receipt, would you accept it?

Mgr  Yes, but you did show it to me.

Way to go mgr, you got me there.  Took it to Frank Lloyd Wright store- they accepted it immediately and told me they didn't care when I bought it but, could only give me a store credit. 

Good job guys, got me for $1.75 in gas."
1,"Horrible! Avoid at all costs, unless you are a die hard Alice Cooper fan. And if you are there as a fan DON'T eat the food. The food is low grade ""pub grub"" (frozen food that's been deep fried). Service is slow & totally apathetic."
1,"I fully appreciate that Mr. Roberts is a blue collar dive bar that's located on Atwood. So when a friend asked me to join him to watch a favorite band there, I set my expectations accordingly.

Is it possible for an establishment to disappoint you when you've already lowered your expectations to crackhouse-lows? Only if that establishment is Mr. Roberts.

The tap beers are not only unexciting, they're as stale and flat as day old bread that's been run over by a steamroller.  Bartenders are more interested in talking with their buddies than they are helping anyone. And the whole vibe of this place is more sketchy than an Etch-A-Sketch wearing Sketchers... 

I'd give anything to not be stuck here right now. I'm scared to death of what might be lurking in the bathrooms... Think I'll go pee in the parking lot."
5,"Decided to visit this place because a friend of mine just started working here, Kristin, she alone is worth a visit to this place. Kristin has such an upbeat personality and a beautiful smile, make sure you ask her when you go and tell her Amber sent ya !!

The restaurant has a huge patio facing Central Ave and the inside is decorated very tastefully. They have a nice selection of wines, specialty cocktails, and beer ( mostly Asian imports ). 

My husband and I ordered :

The Temple of the Thaiger- delicious and described as a party in your mouth, and it was. Perfectly seasoned chicken layered on fried won tons.

Satay Sampler- This was shrimp, chicken, and beef covered in a peanut sauce and was very yummy.

Freshie Rolls- we had the chicken and the veggie and both were soooooo good, this is a must try !

Jasmine rice- steamed to perfection.

All food is made to order and is fresh and delicious. This is a family owned and operated business with Thai born chefs that really know what they're doing. It is a little pricey for Thai food, but the quality and flavor make it worth it. They also have several lunch specials for $7.95 from 11-2 Monday thru Friday."
1,"OMG!!  So this place is under new owners and this place SUCKS now!!  Ever since the new owners bought it this place has gone to HELL!  The food is frozen and not freshly cooked like it used to be.

We used to go here for $2 breakfast every Sat and Sun morning.  Our favorite bartender Tim is gone and our favorite cook is gone and our favorite waitress is gone and this place just sucks egg shells now!!

The owner thinks he can cook, so what does he do??? He puts the cook out on the floor to be a server!! WTH?!?  So bad for business.

Truly wish the previous owners would come back."
5,"If you're looking for a fish fry and are in madison, look no further than esquire. The coleslaw is the best in town. If you're looking to eat a lot, order the ocean perch. If you're trying to eat a light fish fry the lake perch is spectacular. Beer prices are good and it's got a great homey atmosphere"
1,"After reading all the reviews here, i've scheduled an appointment with Bill.I've asked them to diagnoize 2 issues. I've a 03 Nissan pathfinder that burns oil(I've to top off  3 quartz every 1500 miles), and ABS  light on. Bill was good in communication, told me upfront that if they  reach $400 on diagnosis cost, he stops and update me on results which he did.After $180 diagnosis on oil burning issue, no root cause was found. On the ABS he charged $160 and zeroed on ABS sensor.Took 3 to 4 hrs to tell this.

Bill made some other recommendation to fix radiator.A week later, i called them to fix radiator and ABS and i asked if they give credit of diagnosis towards repair. He said NO, and later asked me to come over to his shop to discuss.I eventually didn't go because his quote on radiator job was $680+ while most good shops are around  less than $550.

The awards that they had drove me to the shop, even though it was not on my route.In return i paid more than $400 just for diagnosis and got nothing back.What really disappointed me was the skill level of the mechanics there. If they are truly exceptional, they have to find the hidden issues that normal mechanics cannot see. a simple online search on Google ""03 Nissan pathfinder excessive oil consumption"" could have been more worth than spending over $400 at this shop.

Skilled mechanics go outside their garage and look for other side.This is kind of professionalism service you expect when paying premium.Totally disappointed and frustrated with Bill & team.Too expensive, 0 results,waste of time.They are not good as you think."
5,Awesome end of summer produce at incredible prices you guys! Get there and eye over everything upfront... nabbed some sweet pineapple and peaches on the cheap!
1,"Nice atmosphere. Like an upscale Starbucks. We ordered coffee, chai, a breakfast sandwich and quiche of the day. Was told drinks would be out in a few minutes but food would take 40 minutes. Don't know if its always like that or if they were just short staffed. But seriously 40 min for a slice of quiche and a breakfast sandwich? We told them just make the drinks, forget the food. Even so the drinks took 11 minutes. This place has potential but a wait like that is crazy. Would not recommend until they work their production issues out. One star. Disappointed."
5,Great portions and good food. Stayed for a week near by. Probably ate here 4 times in a week. The southwest Cobb salad is beyond delicious. Great happy hour 4-7 everyday. Highly recommend.
1,"These fuckers charged me twice for my meal!!!! I will never go back, plus the food sucked anyhow... try wingstop or buffalo wild wings instead if you really want some good wings...."
5,Love this place.  If I wasn't on the opposite side of the continent I'd go there all the time.  They start you out with a basket of smoking-hot fresh chips and salsa that's spicy enough to hurt but so tasty you can't stop eating it.  Everything I've eaten there has been good.  My favorite thing to get is a machaca burrito.  Excellent rice and beans come with it.  I go every time I'm in Arizona and I wish I was there right now!
5,"Terrific spot in downtown Phoenix!  I love the Panko Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken and the Curry Vegetables first and foremost.  Beyond that, it's all good and healthy portions.  Tankatsu sauce is a favorite right now too."
5,"This is hands down the best overall Mexican restaurant in The Valley. By overall I mean they have excellent family style food and your run of the mill Mexican favorite's, tacos, enchiladas and such. 

Great hot sauce and the best tacos I have ever had in the 10 years I have lived here. Love the family style seafood dinner as well. Great and friendly service as well!"
5,Doughnuts are legit.  'Nuff said.
1,Three weeks later and my machine has tension problems like never before. Guess where I won't be going to get it fixed?
5,"If I had a friend from overseas come to visit, and he asked me to show him what good American food was like, I know without a doubt this would be the place that I would display to him with great national pride. Actually, I take all my friends who come to visit Madison to Monty's. I once had a friend visiting who was on a very strict diet (gluten free + fasting for lent) with me and she had a good three pages of vegetarian and gluten-free menu to choose from.

This shouldn't scare off those looking for a greasy spoon, however, because you're free to order something at the complete opposite of that spectrum. Bacon grilled cheese, donut french toast, chicken fried steak, alcoholic milkshakes...You name it, they probably have it. My one piece of advice is that you should probably look at the menu ahead of time because it is so expansive that you could spend as much as a half hour just trying to make up your mind.

Be prepared to wait a long time if coming in during the weekend brunch rush. Do not be deterred, it is completely worth every second.

For what it's worth this is probably my #1 favorite restaurant in Madison, if not my favorite restaurant ever."
5,"Super Vegan/Vegetarian friendly, and can will accommodate any and all tastes!

The menu is pretty much impossible to choose from, since there are so many delicious items on it. I usually break down and get one of their awesome burgers. I only travel to Madison once every couple years to visit family, and I frequently think back to how yummy their Walnut veggie patties are.
My Grammy always orders a chocolate malt and the waffle fries (which are top-notch). She's 93, and she knows what's up.
This is the place to be."
5,"Herberger's Lunchtime Theatre is truly the coolest thing to do for lunchtime in downtown Phoenix.  

You can pick up a live 30-45 minutes live theatre performance on your lunchbreak and eat a decent deli sandwich in one of the best theatres in the valley for $12.  

UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!

Why this isn't a sell out crowd every day makes no sense to me.  Herberger has been doing it for years and I swear I am going to do this regularly, and I don't even work downtown.

If you are on lunchbreak you may need to extend your lunch break a little just for commute or parking.    

You were probably going to spend $12 on lunch anyway, you may as well stop by a world class theatre watch a witty show with what seem to be professional actors for 45 minutes.  

The shows run for about 2 weeks and then there is 2 week break, then a new show runs for another two weeks, throughout the season.  

SCHEDULE:
http://www.herbergertheater.org/lunch_time_theater

Join the mailing list.  Herberger will mail you the entire schedule each season.  They are brilliant shows that usually get a earnest guffaw from me before they end.  

This is a concept that is so good, people can't conceive that such a show is available at such a time and such a place!  Best value in Theatre!!!"
1,"I used to love them, then they sent me a pair of dull shears. Then they sent  me a new pair , but it only took 2months to send me a new pair to the wrong address mind you. So decided to buy from someplace else.  Just got the new shears and am sending them back but  I HAVE TONPAY THENSHIPPING ON THEIR CRAP......  I'm through with ryans  and there's obnoxious shit...."
5,"Dr. Eric Goldberg is a fantastic doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had. Unlike many of my past doctors, Dr. Goldberg is very accessible and we have been able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly. We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look forward to being his patients for many years to come."
5,"Went to the Emergency room on a weekday morning.  Guess I timed it right, since I was triaged, treated, and discharged all in less than 2 hours.  Staff were courteous and friendly.  Very respectful.  Explained everything in detail.

The only negative was that the Emergency room building as dated compared to the rest of the hospital.  Despite that, all modern looking equipment and supplies.

As far as others commenting on wait time, best to time a visit if possible in the morning on a weekday since most people visit an emergency department in the afternoon or evening after work.  I've learned this the hard way over the years no matter which hospital you go to."
5,This place is a great stop for lunch. The sandwiches are huge and they use boars head premium deli meat on their subs. I challenge you to take down a whole one. They also make fresh pasta and lasagna that is to die for. Check This Place Out!
1,"I agree with Ian below as well. The Moonlight Masquerade event was the worst planned event I've ever attended. There was absolutely no theme concept, the music was atrociously paired (and half of the acts were unlistenable), they quickly ran out of food, drinks, and souvenirs within 45 minutes, and THE TICKETS WERE 60 FRIKKIN DOLLARS!!! 
The Botanical Garden was quickly becoming a great cultural institution for it's well planned and designed events, its great variety of performers and entertainment, and its ties to the arts community in the valley. I have heard from ex-volunteers that all the talented people in the events department have quit or been fired in the last six months because the dimwit department heads don't want to lose their jobs. They are now breaking contracts with performers, treating guest artists and garden staff poorly, getting cheap and poor quality entertainment, and mis-planning their events. It's too bad. Looks like a bunch of fools are running the place now and I am disappointed because DBG has the potential to be a real cultural institution in Phoenix - a city that has far too few."
1,"Don't even want to give this place any stars. I found a chunk of tin foil in my burger. I took it up to get a new one and the person didn't say one word to me. No sorry no nothing. Just took the burger, made me a new one and gave it back...without saying one word to me. Customer service is absolutely terrible which is a shame because the food is usually good there."
5,"this is probably the coolest diner in downtown phoenix. all organic ingredients, a kickass interior (it's super small, but totally rad), and great people working. say hi to the bearded jewish cook, andy, and he will make your food just the way you want it, and also, with love.

the food is totally cheap and tastes exquisite. you can also eat outside, if you want. 

it's located on a nondescript corner in a residential area, so it's easy to miss, but this place is definitely worth checking out if you're downtown.

also, the hours up there ^^ say it's open until 5, but i am pretty sure they close at 3."
5,"We went to the Welcome Diner on ""First Friday"" earlier this month.  We'll be back for sure.  It's a very casual atmosphere with some limited indoor seating along a counter and more seating outside.  We each enjoyed our meals.  I eat vegan and loved the Vegan Po'Boy; my son is a vegetarian and he loved the grilled cheese sandwich; and my wife, the carnivore of the family, really liked her fried chicken sandwich.

They try to use local foods.  The staff was great, as was the music they were playing."
5,"Back when Welcome Diner was just burgers, hot dogs, and giant chocolate chip cookies served on greasy paper plates speckled with ants (or ""protein sprinkles"" as momma called 'em) it was simply a welcome diner. Now it's so much more than that.

Have you ever watched someone hand you a glass of local red wine blend through a trailer window? How about a Sazerac? Well, it's time to change that. (Here I am assuming you said no. If you said yes, please un-see this section and continue.) When you start your meal with a southern throwback cocktail and finish it with homemade beignets, you best believe that whatever comes in between is going to knock your socks off. This is fine because you're probably sitting outside, so the dress code is pretty nonexistent, anyway.

My crew ordered the three most talked-about items on the menu. The peanut butter burger is the safe option + a bit of ""flare"" that is essentially peanut sauce. The meat is delicious, as is the bun and everything else between it. We also had the Carol, which was a unique BBQ pulled pork & biscuit sandwich with slaw... a mustard-y spin on a stack of down-home delicious. Last but DON'T YOU EVER THINK LEAST, the Bumblebee fried chicken & biscuit sandwich with honey and amazing b&b pickles. Us Southerners opted to scoot the mustard to the side and let the honey shine, but you could probably do anything to this fried chicken and it would still be incr-edible. Just get it. Get a bucket of it.

Now let's talk beignets. (Don't you wish people said that to you more often? You're welcome.) You can get them with powdered sugar & honey or peanut butter & jam. The waitress literally said the pb&j beignets were her favorite thing in the world, and then quickly added her daughter as a frontrunner to the favorites list. Not knowing her taste in dessert, or daughters for that matter, I trusted her immediately and was thrilled with the combination of light, lemony fried dough juxtaposed with fresh berries and creamy peanut butter. Ain't nothing wrong with the classic, but damn it, it's 2014. The matrimony between pb&j and beignet shouldn't even be questioned.

TL;DR - The Welcome Diner isn't just tasty, it's soulful and lovely. Bring an insatiable appetite and leave with a permasmile."
1,As far as pizza goes... Um no thanks.
1,"Wow! I can't believe this place gets so many good reviews. 
I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you don't even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; ""white meat chicken"" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service."
1,"Fabricated hype is the theme for this restaurant chain in Arizona - they intentionally select (nearly) all locations with insufficient parking and insufficient building size to accommodate their customers.  Once you're on the lengthy waitlist along with a small crowd of others, they want you to think.... wow, this is a happening place!

But the pain doesn't stop here.  The hostess has strict but unreasonable seating rules.  Example: she wouldn't seat my party of 4 at a 4 top table because 2 people were parking the car.  Not even 30 seconds later, she seats a party of 2 at that last remaining 4 top table.  Then, of course, my 2 missing people walk right up and we have to wait 25 minutes for the next available 4 top table.  Great policy, Oreganos!

This self-styled Chicago theme restaurant offers deep dish pizza, but they're quick to point out how long the wait is for the pizza (likely after you've waited a long time just to get a seat) and so the vast majority of their pizza sales are thin crust.  Not bad, but the reputation for great Chicago pizza isn't exactly ""Chicago thin crust"".

Wall murals are entertaining, as are the self-deprecating T-shirts worn by the staff.  Food is very average, and the menu is quite decorative.

On the whole though, it's all hype and little in way of substance."
5,"There is no doubting that I am an Aveda girl. Being in Phoenix and having plenty of Aveda salons around you would think I'd be beauty-heaven. But when I left Cleveland I was very hesitant to leave my hairdresser so I scheduled my hair appointments around when I'd be flying home. 

Well, as one could image, that become very expensive, so I finally decided to take a chance with Perry Monage downtown. I'm so glad I did! From the moment I walked in to the stylist, they were spot-on with customer service and they did an amazing job with my cut and color, too! There was a little up-selling me with products which I wasn't use to and I must admit, I did cave but I mean, Aveda, hello? Can we say amazing!

I'm still in love with Aveda and I'm now in love with Perry Monage."
1,"Not a fan.  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats, my total came to be about $3.00.  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my ""plastic money"" the debt card and they wouldn't take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.  What store has a minimum nowadays???  

The customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying. 

Needless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores..."
5,"BEST BURGER SPOT I'VE COME ACROSS!! I was out one night craving a burger and jumped on yelp and happened to be driving down roosevelt. This was the first place that came up. I drove down and stopped by. This place is really cool. I like the open setup outside. There's benches for you and your friends to chill on while u enjoy your meal.  There's a dinner car that seats about nine people that's cool to sit in. 
The service is GREAT!!! All the people there are super cool. A very friendly atmosphere that anyone can enjoy. When your foods ready they always check to make sure everything's right before giving it to you. 
Now.... The burgers and catfish sandwiches are AMAZING!!! I have had the welcome burger, the peanut butter burger and the Friday night catfish poor boy!!! All left smiles on my face wanting more. You have to try this place out!!! IT'S A DEFINITE MUST!!!"
5,"I can't say enough great things about this location in Middleton.  Earlier this year, I had a one-bedroom suite for almost three months.  A family member was in the hospital at UW-Madison during this time and this hotel was more than accommodating for the specific needs in our situation.

I'm not going to go into the specific details of the accommodations partly to protect individual privacy.  The other reason not to get so detailed is simply because I think the staff went so far out of their way that these ""favors"" may potentially be abused by other guests if they were aware of the extreme kindness.  

As I mentioned, this hotel offered many special accommodations.  This allowed us to truly  feel like we had a ""home away from home"".  Most of the staff knew me by name.  They were sensitive to the fact that I had a loved one who was in the hospital and critically ill. I wasn't alone in this, though.  There were many other guests in a similar (if not same) situation as me.  This hotel could be a pilot for partnering up with hospitals in a win, win, win scenario that benefits the hotel, hospital, and the guest/patient.  In addition, I would not be surprised if they have special training for their staff in the area of customer service and handling special accommodations.  

The manager, Brad, is visible and on-site on a regular basis.  He and his staff organize and manage a social for their guests three nights a week.  The social offers a free meal and drinks (including beer and wine) for a couple hours in the evening. And, as the name describes, it allows their guests an excellent opportunity to socialize.  

There are several hotel options recommended by UW and we tried three of them.  This one may be five miles away from the main UW hospital, but it is a straight shot along University Avenue.  Now that UW purchased the Best Western Intowner, there is much more of a push with them recommending their newly owned property to UW patients.  The Intowner is fine, but the best thing going for it is how close it is to the hospital. The Staybridge-Middleton, outshines them in so may ways - indoor pool, hot tub, laundry facility, garage, large suites, kitchenettes, socials, breakfast buffet,and most of all...the staff.

Unfortunately, I can not remember all the names of the staff that I would love to thank.  Our housekeeper was perfect.  She cleaned only when we needed it and got to know our preferences.  For instance, she asked if we could use an extra box of Kleenex because she remembered us requesting an extra box the week before.  She always did a great job cleaning and freshening up our room and never invaded our space. 

I noticed how well the staff work together as a team and support each other when the need arises.  It's obvious that the staff members are cross-trained to manage various work areas and different shifts.  For instance, I first met Bonnie on the shuttle.  She arrived at UW Hospital to pick me up.  She even showed me a quicker route back to the hotel during rush hour.  During my stay, I also saw Bonnie at the front desk, at the breakfast buffet, in the kitchen area, in the dining area, managing the socials, and even came to our suite to fix the television!  It turned out that the remote needed new batteries - which she was prepared for.

I also feel like I got to know Ana pretty well since she worked the breakfast buffet many mornings.  Between her and Bonnie, I just don't know how they always seem to make everything run so smoothly.  

There is another lady with short blonde hair (sorry, I can't seem to remember her name)  that always worked the socials.  She was so welcoming and learned what I like to eat and drink.  She even encouraged me to take food ""to-go""  when I needed to rush back to the hospital.  It was like being with family.

Jan, Justin and Bobby are always a pleasure at the front desk.  Not only are they welcoming, but they go out their way to get answers to your questions and take care of any requests.  

My final comments are definitely not the least important.  During my stay, I noticed that there was a team of about three housekeeping staff members who appeared to have cognitive/mental disabilities.  I was so pleased to see this and know that this hotel and the manager recognize the need to utilize talents that are so often overlooked. There may have been moments of inconvenience for the guests or perhaps mistakes made by these staff members.  However, this is how they learn and become an integral part of society.  I commend Brad Cook for making diversity a priority.

Until my next stay..."
5,"What a wonderful place Craig runs! So happy we chose to stay at The Parsonage for a girls weekend to Madison.

The highlights:
- Location: While the B&B is about 25 minutes from downtown Madison, it's very easy to get to. The perk of being off the beaten path is, well, being off the beaten path. 
- Price: The three of us chose the top floor Reverend's Retreat, which can actually sleep up to 6. It had the feel of your parent's attic, but in a good, comfortable way. For the Friday & Saturday night, it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in Madison.
- Food: Oh my goodness, can Craig cook! The breakfasts alone would've been worth $20/person at a restaurant. Definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. 
- The company: On the weekend we were there, we (late 20s/early 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people. Chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in Madison. And, Craig and his wife have two lovely dogs. 

If you're in town, definitely look up & consider The Parsonage."
1,"What's your opinion of an MD who wears a three piece suit?  When I see a doctor wearing a three piece suit, the first thing that comes to my mind is, why is he wearing a suit?  Did he wear a suit to class in med school?  Did he wear a suit doing rounds during residency?  I know lawyers and investment bankers wear suits, but doctors?  I want to see my doctor in  a white coat.   Who wears a suit if they don't have to?  Am I obsessed with what people wear?  Not normally, but when an MD dresses in a suit, then I can't stop wondering why...  You get the picture.  To me, there's something not right about a doctor under the age of seventy wearing a suit.  I could spend this review just commenting about workplace attire, but I need to move on.

Dr Stevens performs surgery at HIS surgery center - YIKES!   I hate doctors who have a business in addition to their practice.  They see patients in the office, they do surgery at THEIR surgery center. There's a conflict of interest here:  is it possible that patients who may not need surgery are scheduled for a procedure to pay for all that expensive equipment.  I HATE INCORPORATED DOCTORS!! The Gucci loafers.  The conferences in New York, Anaheim, Orlando, Miami, etc.  Making $200K  from a regular practice isn't enough?  Are you a doctor or a businessman?   What's more important:  helping the sick or your bottom line (like I want a new boat that costs $260,000 and the down payment is $26,000 so I need to get 23 surgeries done in the next 3 weeks to get that payment together).  If I want you to do my surgery at the Mayo Clinic is this possible?   I want to have surgery at a hospital.  Because, let's say something goes wrong.  Drastically wrong, like I stop breathing.  When this happens in a hospital they call code blue and every available doctor and nurse runs as fast as they can and does their best to get you breathing again.  In a surgery center there may not be any other doctors and there may not even be a nurse.  People die in surgery centers.    When I hear surgery center, I think of people getting liposuction and dying from blood loss in the recovery room because the doctor left and no trained medical staff are available.  
Dr Stevens is arrogant:   i was extremely ill when I had a consultation with him. I had quite a few questions to ask about my situation.  Dr. Stevens kept writing and wouldn't look me in the eye when he deigned to answer my questions.  He kept looking at his notepad.  Damn it:  stop writing, lift up your head and look at me when I'm talking to you.  While I'm in the middle of this, it began to hit me that this was not the doctor for me.  I'm paying for the consultation, I could barely walk, it was June - so it was HOT outside.  I was exhausted, had been out of work for several weeks.  Was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon. He said he does the procedure i need all the time.  Maybe that was true, but he would NOT be doing this on me. As I was walking to the garage so I could collapse in my car, I was almost ready to give up.  I knew I had to go home, get on the internet and find a doctor that I liked.   I ended up  going with  Dr. Mark Lyons, a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic."

5,"This place has been around for as long as I can remember. Each time my family and I have come here, the food is always on point and never a disappointment. Their ticket times are quick, they food is tasty and full of flavor. You have a choice between two salsa's, both are very good! I have yet to find any restaurant that can compare in their food. Many of their dishes are very comforting and remind me of the way my grandmother used to cook. Staff is quick and friendly. 

My family and I will always be loyal customers of Comedor Guadalajara!"
5,"I've never actually been here (always had someone go and get it) and the only thing I can rate are their cheesesteaks because that is all I have ever had.  Based on that alone, it gets 5.  It is the most authentic cheesesteak that I have had in the PHX.

Shredded steak, melted cheese THROUGHOUT, not just shredded steak on a slice of cheese, and the bread, oh the bread.  That's all.  No cheese whiz, no lettuce, tomato, peppers ... just cheese and steak.  And it's heaven."
1,"It's taken me many months to get around to writing this but I can't seem to stop thinking about it...so I'm compelled make this known by ALL who will read it. This restaurant to had decent Thai food and the service was just ok. That would have been fine had the waiter not taken the liberty of changing the amount of the tip I indicated on my Visa receipt. When I reviewed my statement online and discovered he had done that, I printed the statement and took it and the receipt (as proof) back to the restaurant to explain what happened to the manager. The manager refunded my entire tip in cash. Some would say that should have solved it, but for some reason the manager's reaction to the incident wasn't what I had hoped for. It felt more like he wanted me to simply go away with cash rather than regain my confidence as a customer. I went with what it felt like. Haven't been back and will likely NEVER return."
1,"How incredibly pathetic.  I just had the worst experience at Red.  Then I get on Yelp and realize how many others have come to the same conclusion--enough to write about it!  How can a store possibly survive if you are treated so poorly.  Wow.  I was seriously shocked--zero personality and 100% icy and rude--as if they didn't even want you in the store.  So why did they open one?  Even if I found the perfect piece, I would never buy from RED MODERN FURNITURE.  People buy from people.  It is about time the owner figured that out."
1,"If you are Coming here because the sushi, go somewhere else.
Not much options on the menu and sloppy sushi.
What they call specials, it's is a regular option anywhere else."
1,"Zen 32 was my sushi standout in Phoenix, AZ until today. 

After moving to NYC, I went back home and visited my old hang outs. Some things have changed. 

Though Kona Grill at the Fashion Square in Scottsdale was always my fav, I considered Zen 32 to be the best sushi place in Phoenix -- great dim ambiance, a big outdoor patio with misters for Happy hour, and cute canoes on the ceilings. 

However, today there were not one, but two flies in my Saki-Rita drink. The waitress apologized, but left the charge on the bill, plus the charge for the replacement drink. After much aggravation, the manager removed the charge. 

The floating flies were not the worst part. I was left wondering what eles is floating around the kitchen. There was also a 1/2 inch piece of who knows what in my spicy tuna roll -- maybe it was a scale? A piece of plastic? Hard to tell. 

Conclusion, go to Zen 32 for the ambiance. Not the food or drinks. Perhaps bring friends you dislike and watch them eat?"
1,I was so shocked at an empoyee customer interation tonight that I actually walked out of the store and drove all the way over to the apple in scottsdale quarter. A women asked about how long her wait in line was and was screamed at by an apple employee. I have never seen anything like it in my life.
5,"Third update... excessive, yes.  Warranted, yes.  Read on.


I'm convinced that Dick & Arnie's is one of Madison's/Middleton's best kept secrets.  True, Dick isn't around much - but in his defense, he's probably been cutting hair for 50+ years, so he deserves some time away.

That said, I've gone back twice since my last review (my hair grows fast), and every cut has been absolutely stellar.  Ka, who has cut my hair the last two times, is absolutely wonderful.  Very attentive, very helpful, extremely friendly, and really knows how to cut hair.  

The place seems to thrive on walk-ins, so don't bother making an appointment.  I think that trying to schedule an appointment is the only downside to Dick & Arnie's... and, it was my only source of frustration.  As soon as I accepted the fact that it's best to just walk-in, life has been great.

Set aside 30-40 minutes and walk-in.  Your haircut will take 15-20 minutes, tops; the extra time is ""cushion"" just in case the place is full.  Don't worry about who does your hair - everyone there seems to know exactly what they're doing, and they do it well.

$15 for a stellar haircut?  No brainer.  Go to Dick & Arnies, appreciate it for what it is, and leave with an excellent haircut.  You won't be disappointed."
5,"I've taken Audrey, my Audi, to Virginia Auto Service a couple times for routine maintenance. I first heard of them through a coupon in the mail, though I'm not sure how they got my address! :)  

Being new to the area and because the Audi dealership is way up in north Scottsdale, I decided to give them a try. Not to mention because I value the more personalized service of a small business, but that's a longer discussion... 

I've been thoroughly impressed with VAS's personal service, their ability to squeeze you in on relatively short notice, the ease in making an appointment, and their communication on what the deal is with your car.  They also have a free ride service to drop you off and pick you up, which is highly convenient! 

If you have a European car, I highly recommend giving these guys a try!  I'm fiercely protective and OCD about my car -- if I trust Audrey to someone, you know you can."
1,"They tried to cover up dry, bland food with an excess of sauce. Perhaps that is the point of Bar-B-Q, but it didn't impress me at all. 

The ""dinner rolls"" were cold rolls wrapped in plastic wrap and the salad came with a package of blue cheese dressing. 

Basically it was dry, cheap meat covered in BBQ sauce served with hospital cafeteria sides. 

Perhaps that is what ""Chicago Style"" means. Whatever the case, I wont be back."
5,I love the Tip Top.  I have eaten here half a dozen times and everything has been delicious and reasonable.  The drinks and the wine selection are great for a bar of it's size and the owner is fantastic!  I especially recommend the pastrami reuben.
1,"Pizza is like sex.  Even bad pizza isn't half bad.

Well my first girlfriend and this place have proven that old age adage NOT to be true.

Zero, and I mean ZERO flavor in this pizza.  I'm all about the sauce and this sauce has the distinct flavor of water.  And where in the heck do you find flavorless Pepperoni?  Where ever you do, that's where these guys shop!

Yikes!"
1,"stopped here for a late night snack. ordered the slider burgers. the waitress asked me how i'd like them cooked, and i replied ""medium rare."" shortly, i was brought over 4 sliders that were the size of meatballs. they were all medium well to well done and they were served dry. yes, they brought me 4 pieces of overcooked meat on buns. nothing else. when i complained about it, the manager came over and informed me that was the only way to cook sliders, since they are so small, you can't make them medium rare. perhaps he thought i'd never ordered sliders before, or maybe he thought i've never cooked sliders before, but i've eaten dozens of them medium rare.  they were nice enough to take the sliders off my bill, but i still left hungry. the waitress was very nice about everything, though."
5,"The hotel's about a 15 minute walk from the Phoenix Convention Center. Not bad at all. 

The staff is super nice and friendly. 

The breakfast is perfect, a step up from the typical donut breakfasts at a lot of hotels. 

The room was clean, big and comfortable. 

I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
1,Horrible service. Barely acknowledged when you first walked in. Slow service and waited for my check for 20 minutes before getting up to go get it myself. Will not come again.
1,"TERRIBLE!!!!   The new ""hand-tossed"" christ sucks!!!!  We will never order pizza from here again!  The mac and cheese was good though"
5,"I love how fresh their produce is. Everything is very organized and easy to find. The music they play is relaxing and the employees and very helpful/well informed. Their prices vary, many things a little bit more expensive than your mainstream grocery store, however they have great items on sale each week which are very affordable on a budget. It's closer to home for me, so driving else where to pay a little less isn't worth it to me. Also, a big plus is that they regularly have samples throughout the store and have a red box movie rental station."
1,"We went with a group of friends, and were very disappointed, I have been there before and I strongly recommended place, however food was terrible and overprice, I don't what had happened, service was poor, waited long for waitress to take order, or even take the drinks order, when she finally took order for food it took more than one hour wait for food to come  one at a time, 20% was added to bill, and this was not OK specially after poor service. Anyway will definitely won't EVER go back...."
1,"It's been about 3 weeks since this incident happen, I wish I could say it improved, but it didn't, it got much worse.  After we finally got in touch with Mr. Olson, he apologized and tried to blame it on the supplier saying they mismarked the ring, even though the last time we had spoken with somoeone it was because of a ""bad employee"".   They agreed to replace the ring from the supplier, yet last Friday,  they informed my husband they just got the materials and the ring would be done shortly ( they made the ring, big mistake).  The ring was such poor quality , that I actually laughed when I saw it.  Their were scorch marks around the crooked channel set diamonds.  The wave actually covered part of the diamond. I was livid!  I took the ring to another jeweler, because Mr. Olson had agreed to allow an outside appraisal event hough they did their own (that was a joke).  The other jeweler I took the ring to was appalled by the quality of the ring.  She said the scorch marks on the ring  were from them trying to solder the diamonds in.  She also saw bubbles in the platinum along with the crooked channel setting.  I took the ring back to Mr. Olson right after speaking with the other jeweler, and he didn't understand why I was so upset.  He finally admitted to seeing the wave in the ring and heard him discuss it with his jeweler about the quality.  He tried to tell me that they were rushed and then the reason they couldn't order another ring was because it was an ""Estate ring"" (this was new)......Finally he offered me a refund ""Because I obviously can't make you happy"", well no you can't if you provide poor service and poor quality materials.  Its extremely upsetting that we no longer have our rings that we made our vows with...That's something we can never get back.  
Fortunately, we went to Molina's this afternoon and purchased our new beautiful and symmetrical wedding bands.  Their service and quality were amazing and comforting.  I wish we would have purchased our bands here from the beginning (lesson learned). By the way, has I was talking with Mr. Olson, he had opened up a folder with our names on it,  he had a printed copy of my yelp review and stapled it to the folder...so  guess this is another one he can add!!!!"
1,"I originally went to the AZ Heart Institute due to fainting spells and periods of breathlessness when I wasn't moving.  In addition to an extremely abrupt manner - saying things like, ""Doesn't matter.  Nope.  Doesn't matter,"" when I told him about my family history of heart problems (didn't matter because it was my uncle, not my parents.  Because there's no way that my grandmother could have passed the defective heart gene to my mother, who could have passed it to me without showing symptoms herself.  And the fact that my father at the time had heart issues, eventually dying from a heart attack, was inconsequential.), the doctor seemed extremely bored and had a ""why are you wasting my time"" demeanor.

I was wasting his time because I was in my early twenties, but was having chest pains, hard thumps in my chest, and was passing out in clusters.  The icing on the cake however, and the reason I left and never came back, was when he shut the door and it bounced slightly open, and I was able to hear him making fun of me to a nurse right outside the door.  Humiliating, to say the least.

Now, some years later, I continue to have clusters of fainting, gasping for air, pounding in my chest, and memory problems.  I'm in the process of having the issue diagnosed with another cardiology practice, one who actually listens and has the courtesy to at least wait until I leave to snort and laugh about whether or not you can believe this chick.  I would never ever return to this place, nor would I ever recommend anyone go there.  As a matter of fact, I have steered a couple of friends away from the AZ Heart Institute due to my experience."
1,"Unless you are Black and like to be talked down to, don't eat here! I came in at 5:40 PM, closing time is 6:00. When I told the cashier (Peter) that I wanted to sit and eat, he said they close ""in 10 minutes"" and I could only get my order to go. I passed on the potato chips and drink, so he lost $2.50. I paid with a credit card, so I obviously had money. When I asked to speak to the manager, the preparer Hedi (sp) said it was Peter. I told Peter that I felt I was disrespected because he wouldn't let me eat there. Peter said he had problems with people staying ""at least 45 minutes"" after closing and thinks that ""other Black people think that he (Peter) talks rude to them."" When I told him I would make a complaint, Peter said ""go ahead."" I will call the corporate office and tell them that Peter profiled me. I must wonder if I were a White male could I have eaten my sandwich there."
1,"This place needs to get their act together. We went there before the D'backs game. They were understaffed and you can hear people complaining about the service but we stayed anyway. The young man that took our order I don't think was even a server. He got every one of our orders wrong. Everything went back. I went to the restroom and I heard a server say to the bartender that they have never been so busy on a Saturday. What? This was 4:30 in the afternoon! Once we got our food nobody came by and asked how was everything. We needed our water refilled and I actually had to track down someone to get the refill. They offered us free fried ice cream for the inconvenience and we politely declined! Ugh! What mess this place is! Stay away, stay far away from this place!"
5,"My favorite microbrew that I have ever been to.  Having lived nearby for many years I frequented this place as my favorite in Madison.  

The beer are all good with my favorites being the Maibock and Autumnal Fire (Eisphyre) if it is available. 

For those that prefer lighter beers the amber or supper club are wonderful too.  

They don't sell food on site but numerous neighborhood restaurants in the area are available for delivery.  Another option would be to use the grills on the patio which the brewery owns. 

Live music nights outside are worth a stop since they are free.  Local bands/people play."
5,"This place was off the hook!! As I say, ""hella good""! Like hella gooooooooooooood! I strongly recommend this place especially with a group of friends around sunset to kick back at this chill establishment with cool outdoor lighting and throw back some drinks before your meal. 

By the way, if you gotta whizz...prepare to step into an airplane sized bathroom literally right next to the kitchen...so hopefully you will not need to DO anything else there...haha

Great eats tho, everyone in my party loved their dishes. Cheers.

1,"I guess you could say I have been here 1.5 times.  This is the closest walk in clinic to my work place so I have ventured here out of convenience.  The first time was last summer and I just felt ill all over.  After a total of 3 hours here they did not know what was wrong with me but were going to treat me like I had strep throat. Three hours is not too long to wait if the lobby had been full but there were only about 3 others waiting with me and what seemed like an army of employees.  I was in the actual exam room for what seemed like 2.5 hours.  They were ""kind"" enough to give me a blanket which looked like someone had vomited all over it and then it dried to a crusty finish.  The nurses kept coming in and checking on me; taking blood pressure  and temperature and demanded I take a pregnancy test.  I told them it was highly unlikely I was preggers (since I was not getting any but I felt they did not need to know all my extra cirricular activities or lack there of so I obliged them).  Finally they wrote me a prescription and I was on my way.   They never gave me the results of my pregnancy test but I was able to figure it out! 

So, feeling ill and desperate I decided to give it one more chance yesterday but found myself disgusted as soon as I walked in.  There was a sign that read:  Due to technical difficulties we can not accept credit or debit cards.  Only cash or checks.  Well, I forgot my check book (since it's not 1987)  and don't carry cash so I asked the receptionist if I could put my name down and then run to the ATM about 2 blocks away.  She was at a loss for words but then basically told me no.  There were 8 people ahead of me!  I doubt they would get to the other 8 in the ten minutes it would take for me to go to the ATM.

Upset and ill I remembered another clinic that I have been told is nice and I was on my way."
1,"One of our first restaurant visits when we moved here.  We have since learned to avoid any restaurant a local recommends.  Menu was full of bland comfort food.  Wife had chicken and dumplings that tasted like they came out of a can  My steak was tough and flavorless.  Restaurant has been in the same location for about 100 years and it shows, it's badly in need of a remodel.  Entire place smelled like vomit and was dirty.  I could smell the bathrooms ten feet away and when I had to visit they were even worse, layer over layer of dirt.  Where's the health inspector.  Service was extremely poor, especially considering we were the only people in the place.  I guess the highschooler that was serving us was too busy talking on her cell phone to help us."
5,"I love Zimbrick Acura. I love every Zimbrick in the city for that matter. I have never had a bad experience here. I have come here for every little item I needed done and have never felt cheated or had the blanket pulled over my eyes. There have been a few things where I was expecting a HUGE bill for things like the stabilizer for my rear suspension that had been slightly bent. I bought a new one and brought it in thinking well Labor will be $100. Zimbrick got me right in, said it would take an hour, had it out in half an hour and didn't charge me a dime. Another time I have come in expecting to replace all my breaks and rotors and Zimbrick saved me about $300 without having to replace everything. 

I have worked with a few guys here and they have ALL been extremely professional and treated me like family. The guy I usually go to even just chats with me about cars and such while i'm having service done. (Mainly getting my oil changed). The facility itself is nothing less than perfection, in my opinion, when it comes to dealerships. It is clean, well layed out, they have a great lounge with a Big Screen TV, leather chairs, FREE WIFI, and the best of all... Free Starbucks Coffee. I have had nothing but great experiences from Zimbrick and not just Zimbrick Acura. However, BECAUSE of Zimbrick Acura I expect to buy another Acura and stay with them for a VERY very long time. Thank you Zimbrick Acura! YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST.

P.S. When I was having major service done they let me choose what I wanted to drive while I waited for the day.  NOBODY does that. So I had some fun with a brand new TL one day on a secret ""test"" road Zimbrick European showed me when I was buying my car just off Rimrock Road."
5,"There are so many reasons to shop at Metcalf's.  Sure, the price point may be a little bit higher than Copp's, but the produce and meat selection is fantastic.  They have a better cheese selection than the tiny Whole Foods one, too.

The thing that I really like about Metcalf's is that they are dedicated to the Madison community.  They are the sponsor of Brat Fest and are invested in the eat local movement.  It seems like every time I go there they have more signs up showing ""food miles,"" how far the food has traveled to the store.  They also have a beautiful display near the front of the produce area showcasing veggies and fruits from local farms.

There is a huge selection of prepared foods and even an espresso bar.  You can tell that alot of thought and money went into the recent remodel of the store."
5,"This is the superior of the two OSFs in the Valley.  On my most recent visit, I had a Meat Lover's plate--2 Sicilian meatballs, an Italian sausage, and penne pasta, all in a fantastic meat sauce.  Probably the best plate of pasta I've had in a LONG time.

Fill that out with minestrone soup, hot sourdough with butter, and attentive service, and you have a great meal.  My wife and daughter like the mizithra cheese pastas--not my taste, but they enjoy it, and that's all that matters.  

Plus, an Italian dinner for 4 for about fifty-something dollars is pretty kickass.  I'm absolutely a fan of the OSF.  After trying Italian food all over the Phoenix area for months, this location is still, as of now, my pick for the best pasta in the Valley.

The penne REALLY IS amazing here.  If you haven't been to this OSF yet, you're really missing something special."
5,"Lori's is a great facility with wonderful, confident and friendly staff.  As a veterinarian,  I am comfortable referring my clients with grooming needs to Lori's Pet Agree!  She and her staff do a thorough and professional job.  The pets enjoy the day care and play time that she has available as well.   Lori's Pet Agree is highly recommended! --Dr. Kristine Collins"
5,"My dog goes to this kennel at least twice a month for 4-5 days at a time. He always comes back to me happy and healthy. The staff is kind and really personable, they are good with the dogs and understand that every dog has different needs. My dog has been at several other kennels in Madison before I found hickory hills and he use to come home completely out of it, but here he actually seems happy. My dog is an escape artist and does use his teeth to get out of the kennel, the staff figured out a creative way to keep him in and now his teeth aren't silver."
1,"My wife and I went to Havana Café on our 1st date.  Needless to say we love the place and it means something special to us.  We have been there many times.  The past 3 visits have gone downhill quickly.

3 visits ago, the Paella was mediocre at best.  2 visits ago, the service was poor.  This last trip the service was horrid.  The food was good.   However we waited 20 minutes for our check.  There were 6 of us and they added an automatic 20% gratuity.  I understand that is the policy of most places.  But when the service is plain and simply bad that is just not ok.  To top it off, at 6pm on a Saturday evening, it wasn't just warm in the restaurant, it was flat out HOT.  I was sweating for the 2nd half of our dinner and throughout the time we waited to get our check.  The service and temperature made for a very bad experience.  

I am very sad to say that we will not be back to Havana café."
5,"Every Wisconsin fatty loves a good butterburger, we all know that, but what sets this Culvers apart from the others is the fact that its hands down the best one in Madison, and maybe even Wisconsin. The food is always hot,fresh,well prepared,and served quickly and politely. The other thing is its cleanliness. Its restrooms are always very clean and smell good, and the tables are quickly bussed and wiped down to make room for the next customer. The floors are kept immaculate, and you will never see a mess on the floor or at the condiment station. I think this is because the owner takes great pride in his resteraunt, and is always there. I know this because I live close and eat here 3 times a week, and he's always there. Most of the staff has worked there for a long time as well, and are good at their job. This place is the blueprint of what a Culvers should be,and a shining star among the companys resteraunts."
1,"I was really craving chinese food today... too bad this place was NOT what I had hoped for. I ordered the orange chicken, fried rice, soup, and crab puffs. The chicken is dry and tasteless (on the menu it said SPICY however it is not spicy or flavorful at all). The rice has no vegetables or anything - it is just flavorless, oil soaked grains. The soup container was LESS THAN HALF FULL and smelled so wretched I couldn't bring myself to taste it. The crab puffs were decent, but not enough to make up for the 15 dollars worth of wasted food. I won't be coming back."
5,Just got my VW fixed. Professional service. Good price. Quality work. I am a very happy customer!
5,"Good food, good service and clean.  I had the cashew chicken, my wife had the general tsao's chicken and my son had chicken fried rice.  All were very good.  My only complaint, and it is very minor, is that the chairs have wheels.  It is very easy to scoot yourself around unexpectedly.  I will definitely return the next time I am in Madison."
1,"What happened Tuesday night! They weren't even busy. The bartender (Mike) ignored our empty beer glasses twice even though we held them up to get his attention, there was no hostess to seat my husband and myself. The bus boy seated us and then no one came to our table until we had to ask a waitress where our waitress was. The special was gone so the waitress gave us a free appetizer for our long wait. The food was alright. Then waiting forever for our check we were given a check that was not ours. There was no waitress around so we left cash for the check we were given. I don't think we'll be going back."
5,"If you have a dog or cat, this is the place to get what you need for them.  They don't sell food, but they have just about everything else...toys, treats, bones, bowls, crates, collars, leashes, shampoo, brushes...the list goes on.

They are only open weekdays, 8:30 to 4:30.  I live about 40 minutes away, and I don't get to that area often, but when I do need to go to that area for something else, I plan around Ryan's hours so I can get my pup some toys.  

You can't beat the prices; they are approximately half of what you'd pay at other pet stores.  I am a volunteer puppy raiser, and the pups I raise can only have Kong or Nylabone toys when alone in their crate.  I would go broke buying those anywhere else.  

The staff at Ryan's is really in the warehouse to fill internet orders, but I've always gotten any help I needed from them.  They have all been friendly to me, and I've often been asked if I needed help finding anything.

When you visit, pick up a catalog at the front desk, and leave your purse if you have one.  (You can't bring bags to the back.)  Many of the items on the shelves have prices written on the cartons, but some don't.  And, remember, this is a warehouse...the employees are filling internet orders.  They are not there to tell you prices.  But, trust me, you won't find lower prices anywhere except maybe a yard sale or second hand store.

If you live in AZ but not close to Ryan's, a handy thing to know is that you can order on their website an select ""pick up"".  Then, your order is already pulled for you when you arrive, and you just need to pay for it.

Of course, you can always order online and have it shipped to you.

They do have a minimum purchase requirement of $20 or $25, because they are not a retail store but an internet warehouse.  Really not a big deal...you will not believe how much you can get for your money!"
1,"I have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store.  Today I tried going back after a year, and again the staff is so unhelpful, unknowledgeable and downright rude.  I called to talk with the Manager, and her attitude is just as bad.  Which I guess explains the attitudes of the staff.  There are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers."
1,"Thanks for the service, or lack thereof. Customer service sucked. Not one person offered to help, and yes, it was slow."
1,"Este restaurante lo unico que tiene de Guadalajara es el nombre.  Todo es comida chicana muy malita.  En el escusado habia un hombre semi desnudo aseandose...que asco. 

Verguenza ajena"
1,"Unfortunately, this Safeway is a few blocks from my house. I've been coming here for 3 years and never had any issues here besides the occasional person asking for money in the parking lot. Being the sucker that I am, I usually give it to them. 

Today was different. As I waddled my pregnant self towards the cashier with my antsy 16 month old in tow, I noticed the cashier giving me a death stare. Whatever, I shrugged it off. We all have bad days. Then, as I started to pay, she said to the little girl with her mom behind me, ""Oh good you only have a few items because this is supposed to be an express lane."" With another death stare aimed in my direction. As I looked up, I noticed the 20 items or less sign. I apologized and was only met with more attitude. The little girl behind me asked if she did something wrong and the cashier said ""Oh no honey YOU did nothing wrong."" 

I went home and counted my items. There were 22.

It was an honest mistake but the way the cashier handled the situation was totally out of line. All because I got into the wrong lane by accident with two items over the limit."
1,"Went to the one near cave creek. I had the bacon chicken fajitas. I GOT FOOD POISONING !! BE CAREFULLLLLL :/ I have always been coming here, but for now I'll be taking a break from here !!"
5,"MUY AUTHENTICO!!
When you see los chonchos eating here, you know it's good.

I always avoid Mexican restaurants because everyone does this slap together something that's so standard and has no flavor unless you get some standard bright red sauce. WELL NO MORE!!

My friend had a Groupon (or something similar) for this place so we went. 
When you walk in, you're smacked with the delicious smoke from the FIRE-GRILLED meats they use for your meal! When I smelled that, my anticipation was amplified. You wander past the breads, pastries and cakes, and order from the board and take a seat. Your order number is announced bilingually when ready. Spartan seating, nice colorful tablecloths covered with plastic. Worn floor tile that can take centuries of traffic. You'll see what I mean.

I had the pastor (pork) taco plate with refried beans (slightly runny) and Mexican rice (clumpy), and I accented with selections from the free salsa bar. The salsa bar has whole roasted jalapeños (you might need to peel some skin off) with onion slices (interesting roasted flavor), another section of veggies, then chopped onions, then cilantro, then salsas in descending heat to the right, begining with habañero red salsa on the left! Made me sweat! WATCH OUT, tell your friends, this is no ordinary salsa that you randomly grab and dump on your stuff. Pico de gallo is at the right end, and the MILD red salsa is next to it. The green salsa is DELICIOUS and mild as well.

Sin piedad por gringo: Habanero shot challenge! 2 people or more AFTER your meal. Have ice cream ready. Beer or water won't help.

My friend ordered two tamales, one chicken one pork, both wrapped in different leaves. Definite authentic flavor. We also got Jamaica (""ha-MAI-ca"") which is a super sweet red hibiscus juice. You can also get bottled Mexican beers for $1.99. DEAL!! 

Water is located on the left side of the ordering counter in a self-serve container. 
Extra napkins (you WILL need them) are not readily available, you must ask for your plush paper napkins. Makes sense, they're more expensive, not cheap fiber napkins recycled from cardboard. 
There's also a small grocery area. You can get fresh warm tortillas, a few veggies, some pork ($3.99/lb), authentic chicharones.

Super Inside Skinny: That's freshly made molé in bags at the grocery counter.

Cool Inside Skinny: 24 pack of Mexican sodas (Coke, Pepsi, Sprite I saw, but there might be others, maybe Fanta?) in glass bottles for $16. 
I usually buy them for a buck each at the gas station on the fly, but there's the real deal right there. Works out to 66.66 cents each as you can see!

So overall I'm sold and pleased with La Tolteca. 
THIS is where you want to take your tourist friends when they come."
1,"I've never been to New Orleans, so I don't know if that makes me somehow less qualified to review this place.  But, I suspect a fair amount of people have never been to China, and it doesn't stop them from reviewing PF Changs.

ANYWAY, the thing about NOTO whenever I have eaten there is that I am always expecting it to be way greater than it really is because of the way people talk about it.  I am always expecting this transcendent experience, but really, all I get is a styrofoam container of some spicy slop that really has no real flavor underneath the initial tongue shock of cayenne pepper."
5,Great service but turn up the lights.  I know that it is sunny in the afternoon but really???
5,"The old Welcome Diner is closed, but it is now (temporarily) inhabited by Chef Payton Curry. Check out the reviews here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/payton-curry-at-welcome-diner-phoenix"
5,"I never went into the old Tip Top (because I was far too terrified) but there is no way it held a candle to the current Tip Top. 

Basically, the place looks fantastic from ceiling to floor. It now makes sense why the remodel took so long and it was clearly worth the wait. It's exactly what you'd want a neighborhood bar to be. Small but not too small, inviting atmosphere, comfortable lighting, and no over the top decorating. 

I had a beer and a very good whisky sour. Looking forward to heading back soon."
5,"Love this place. The fun names will bring a smile to anyone. And the wraps are killer.

Ken & Barbie Wrap (spicy BBQ) this lunch break to fix this slump of a mood I woke up in. Just the right of BBQ lovin' inside the mix, making this wrap so so yummie. Messy but oh so good

WooHoo thank you Stevie for the extra fruit"
5,"I've been to Monty's at least once for every meal. The omelettes are to die for, huge in quantity unique in ingredients- highly recommend the spinach and feta. The salads are the same thing, definitely large and delicious. Last night I went for dinner and got the meatless loaf, and now I want the recipe for the cashew gravy (if my memory serves me correctly, it was cashew...) to put on EVERYTHING. Amazing shakes and malts complete the perfect comfort/diner food experience."
5,"LOVE Oakhouse.  I have not been to their store location on Mustang Way, but they are the only bakery I buy from on Saturdays at the farmer's market.  Their cookies and cinnamon rolls are delicious, and their cheese bread is to DIE FOR.  Seriously, there are two locations that sell cheese bread at the market, Oakhouse's bread has more flavor and cheese, and it is cheaper than the other location.  Two thumbs up!"
5,"If you are looking for a no frills Friday night fish fry that will blow your mind, this is your place. I am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful for a very simple meal, with excellent service. 

 We had a little trouble finding the door (the entrance is in the back facing away from Packers Ave.) but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables, we were instantly greeted by our friendly server.  Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  All very standard issue.  

The fish was another story. Whoa.  I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly.  It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious.  The baked potato that came with it was pretty standard, but good.  The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  The little strips were just AMAZING.  I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly couldn't stop eating.  The fries were done to perfection as well.  

My boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out all of that fried goodness in one sitting.  On the way out the cooks from the back yelled good bye, the bartender wished us a good night, and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us to come back soon.  I can't say enough about how friendly everyone here is.  It looks like a burned out biker bar, but their simple menu is done right.  I never thought I would like a place so much that doesn't have salad on their menu, but I anticipate we will be back many many more times."
1,"Wow. One of the worst meals I've had in awhile.

My husband and I came here for some Chicken Fried Steak because he went about 3 years ago and said it was awesome. We showed up and knew that we wanted to order the Chicken Fried Steak right away. They took our order, we waited shortly and our salad came out. Wasn't the best salad. Wasn't really fresh..had a lot of ranch on it, but I can see how somebody might like it. Ate some of it and pushed it to the side.

Soon our steak arrived. I was so excited to try it! I took my first bite and was shocked to find that it was completely bland. I added some salt and ate some more. The meat wasn't the best, which I understand because it's chicken fried steak, however it tasted frozen to me. After the 4th bite, I had to ask my husband if it tasted the same as before. He shook his head no and commented on how disguising it was. Even the mashed potatoes were bland. I agreed and started to feel gross thinking about eating any more of it.  

We both pushed out dishes to the side, with lots of food still left on our plate. When our waitress came by about 10 minutes after she dropped the food off, we told her we were done. She asked if we wanted a box, which we declined, but otherwise no questions or concerns - she didn't even seem to notice that we ate almost nothing off of our plates. Didn't feel like bringing it up at the time, so we just paid our $35 for and left. I hate KFC and I would much sooner eat that than eat here again.."
5,Food is fresh and delicious. Atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming. I loved it.
5,"This is the best BBQ in Madison.  There are no challengers.  Comparing this to Famous Daves is like comparing a Caribou Burger to MacDonalds.  Not to say that MacDonalds/Famous Daves are necessarily BAD, but this is unique, delicious BBQ that wins best in Madison year in and year out for a reason.  The service is generally solid, and having travelled in rural LA a LOT, I can't believe anyone who frequents the southern Miss, Lousiana area to be surprised that a place is closed on Monday.  The pork shoulder sandwich is the #1 item."
1,"I hate this place! I don't know why I ever go in there! If there were a JoAnns every 5 miles I would gladly go there! Every time I go a Michaels I am sadly disappointed. No matter what store I go into the employees are dull, unfriendly and lazy! They are always carrying on dumb conversations. The lines go on forever. The old lady cashiers are always rude like I'm wasting their time! There's always something on the wrong shelf so when you get to the cashier she looks at you like you're lying or just stupid!!! They have lost my business!!! Someone needs to get the District Manager in these stores because they wont stay in business with that customer service!!!"
5,"This cab company is the best in the city in consistency.  Consistently polite, clean, reliable, and safe.  I heart Union Cab!"
1,"I'll start off by saying that I've been to Danny's several times before and they've done a (mostly) decent job washing my car, especially for the price. After my last experience I definitely will NOT be bringing my business to Danny's and DO NOT recommend you do either. 

After I left Danny's (on Highland) I noticed I had a big chunk of paint missing from my drivers-side rear bumper. It looks as though it scrapped up against something. The peel was fresh as all the paint had not peeled off. Admittedly, I had already waited almost 2 hours, after being told it would only be about 35 min for a wash and wax, so I was eager to leave and didn't give the car a full inspection before I left the property. 

I went back the next day to let the manager, Chris, know what had happened and he was very dismissive about my claim. This was after waiting almost 25 minutes for him to come to the front desk. According to him, all he knew was that I did it myself and was blaming it on them.... sure dude. I don't have proof that anything happened at Danny's but the fact that they weren't willing to investigate was very bothersome. 

Moral of the story we've called corporate and they were again very rude and dismissive. Did I mention they hung up on my wife? I don't expect Danny's to look into it and I don't want them to pay for my repair. Just want people to know this is how they treat their customers. Thanks Bye."
1,"I went to the newly renamed 9/05 with a group under the recommendation that they did their tofu dishes really well and catered towards vegetarian foods.

I guess the tofu itself was decent; thick, firm and textured, but the curry (which had been vaunted as one of the best dishes) fell completely flat. Where was the spice? Where was the flavor?? Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked? To add insult to injury, everyone else at the table who had ordered the Pad Thai and Bangkok Dynamite dishes sniffling and complaining about the spiciness of their food. ""I'm Mexican"" whispered one lady ""I LOVE spice, but this is too much with the chili flakes"". At the end of the meal there was plenty of leftover food which everyone declined to take home. 

The entrées started at 10$ and so did the drinks, I was priced out of ordering one of their 15$ ""martinis"" and stuck with a four dollar beer. The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.

Someone mentioned that ownership changed hands with the name changing, maybe the good cooks left as well?"
1,I walk in the store saw employee talking to a customer them he pick up phone totally disrespecful stay AWAY from The three payasos. customer walk way with no commment.
1,"I wouldn't know what the food is like because we were ignored for 15 minutes and my 3 and 5 year old children were antsy, hungry and thirsty so we left.  We went inside and sat at the counter. There were four other people in the big dining area, the register/ server man didn't even look at us. It was rude and I will never go back."
5,"I cry sad tears at night now that I can no longer get crispy fried onions or a meat loaf sammie. You know what helps me sleep, though? Salmon hash. It's so inspirational I re-created the dish this weekend. 
3 times. 
For different people. 
(It's that good.)"
1,"And my streak of staying in quality hotels comes to a screeching halt.

When I'm not vacationing and just need a room to crash in, I tend to be a utilitarian when it comes to hotels. I just need a clean place to sleep and shower and I'm pretty much satisfied. You'd think a hotel by the airport from a national brand would be a safe bet. But no.

For starters, the neighborhood is just disgusting, and I am not easily fazed by such things. Meth labs would count as urban gentrification. I went to check in on Foursquare and the first suggested location that popped up was PROSTITUTES - HOE STROLL.

The old building had a fresh coat of paint, so I maintained my optimism. We got into the room, which was spacious and mostly clean. Acceptably so, at least. It looked like it had been remodeled sometime recently, although the carpet had more cigarette burns than the arms of a working girl who can't make Daddy's quota.

I was OK with mediocrity for $49 a night until I walked into the bathroom. The door was literally hanging off its hinges. And the window had been shattered. And there was a smear of feces on the wall.

If walls could talk, right? These would say GET THE POOP OFF ME.

I was thinking two stars at first, but then overnight, I could barely sleep because the paper-thin walls let in every sound from the whole unsavory neighborhood, from the hookers pretending to enjoy their work, from the drug dealers outside, from what sounded like feral cats in heat.

We got the hell out of there as soon as we woke up and drove around Phoenix randomly all morning rather than spend another minute in the room.

Just awful."
1,"Arrogance or ignorance?  I don't know and I don't care.

Dec 7th, I got home and considered my options.  A stuffed pizza from Oregano's, God, that sounded SO good. I called at 8:13pm and ordered the pizza.  ""You know this pizza takes like an hour"" the super-happy server asked.  ""Yes I do"", I said.

At 9:00, I left my place at 20th St. and Missouri Avenue.  7th Street was closed.  ?!!!  Central Avenue: closed.  7th Avenue, closed.  A parade...

Oreganos: Thank you for calling Oreganos!
Me: Hey, that pizza for Teddy?  Won't be able to pick it up...
Oreganos: Why is that?
Me: BECAUSE ALL THE STREETS THAT LEAD TO YOUR RESTAURANT ARE CLOSED!!!!!!!!!!  Why wouldn't you tell me that?
Oreganos: Oh...I thought that parade would be over by now.  (Laughing) I could 'run it out to you'...oh, just kidding!

Literally, while hungry, an entire 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back.  Oreganos didn't know or didn't care...that The Parade of Lights Parade all but closed access to their restaurant.  Fool me over and over again.  All for the love of a stuffed pizza.  

Hey!  Oreganos!  I'll come back, at some point.  But my point now is, it'll be 6 months-year from now, instead of one/week.  Any kind of customer service, ""Gee, sir, I'd love to get you that pizza but you'll have difficulty getting in here until 9:45"", that kind of customer service.

So, I could not go south but I could go north. I ate a delicious pizza from the new Rosatti's on 16th and Missouri.  Fabulous!"
5,I absolutely love Rosita's Place. This is the definition of real Mexican Food. I have gone here for years i tell everyone i know who loves Mexican food that they must go here. I am still surprised so many people in Phoenix still don't know about it. Also it is one of the best Albondigas i have ever eaten at any restaurant. Since i have moved out of state this is one of the places i miss going to on a regular basis.
1,Beautiful view is all they got going for them. We took our family from New York here. The view was fabulous and the story ends pretty much there if you want to hear good reviews. The food was horrible!!! We all got something different so four people can't be wrong. The server was the worst I have ever seen. Ok so if you know you are busy why don't you update your guests instead of ignoring them knowing that you are busy and won't be able to get to them as much as you would like. Our food took two hours to get to us. I was told it was because of the huge party upstairs. Hmmm well what about the two tables that walked in 45 minutes after us. And got their food 30 mintues before us. Yes that's because their server didn't suck and forget to ring in the food. Then the manager came over and said we will comp you a bottle of wine perfect thank you. But when we tell you how long the food has taken. He argued and said it has been only a hour. And I said yes it has that's when your server remembered to type in the order so that is the time you have on the ticket that gets printed to the kitchen. The table next to us was also pissed and yelling at the server. Get it together!! Your food sucks and so does your service. Well our server any way. Go for bar and views nothing else.
5,"I am so, so, utterly happy with this company that I must share my experience. I was on an impossible deadline with an event the next day and no time to pull collateral from inventory and ship to the event, so I decided to have collateral reprinted in the city of the event (Phoenix). I talked to two companies before I opted to go with Techniprint. I sent my 5 different documents to Techniprint and they came through! We worked together lock and step through the proof process and they were able to deliver on what seemed like an impossible deadline. That you for making me, as a marketer look good, and thank you for producing the quality that our company expects. I will search for more opportunities to use Techniprint again. Thank you Art and Bobby for your impeccable service."
5,"My bucket list is to attempt to visit all HRC locations!!  So, I'm now crossing off Phoenix location!

Dined in and enjoyed all the memorabilia displayed. New location in downtown PHX next to the D-Backs stadium.  Seems to get a good amount of traffic during events but during the weekend it wasn't busy at all.  Sat at the bar ordered a sampler platter and food was pretty good.  Big fan of the restaurant and collected a new pin to add to my collection."
5,"Oh how I miss you, Harmony Bar!  I never miss a chance to grab a walnut burger and hot chips when I'm back in town.  

This is just a wonderful neighborhood bar.  The food is still ""bar"" food but it's quality, tasty and made fresh to order.  The pizza is good, too.  Good beer selection and a truly local atmosphere.  The Harmony fits right into the vibe of the neighborhood.

Oh how I miss you, Harmony Bar!"
1,"Wow! Three doors down tonight was amazing! However having another person assaulting me three separate times was not.  A group of drunk rednecks sitting behind us made several people in the section that I was sitting in get up and leave completely. After being punched in the back of the head on three separate occasions I finally left as well. I informed security, who found my friend and  I different seats, however they DID not remove these unruly drunks, nor did they provide any compensation or even write an incident report. He should have been arrested , instead he was left to ruin other peoples experience. Terrible way to run a business, very unsafe, lawsuit waiting to happen."
1,"OH DEAR GOD. Someone please teach the employees here how to better scrub the toilets. I almost lost my appetite after using the women's restroom.

This Subway has NOT been closed as may have been reported by other Yelpers (I was just there on Friday), but may be it should be."
5,"This is one of the best Mexican food restaurants in the city. The food is authentic and the carnitas is excellent!
The location isn't in the best part of town but it's well worth going because the food in amazing and priced great. 
If you want good Mexican food with large portions this is the pace to go."
1,"If I could give negative stars I would. One of the used car salesman hit me with one of their cars. After being cited by Phoenix PD, he proceeded to lie about who owned the car and what insurance was responsible. Later, after finding out that Auto-Europa actually owned the car and was responsible I tried calling to get insurance information. I spoke with Jason who was rude and dismissive and refused to give me any info so now I have to hire an attorney to file a civil suit. If this salesman Joseph Pratt and the owner/manager Jason are any indication of the type of service and sales it's my duty to warn everyone of their scumbag practices."
5,"My wife and I lived in Bangkok, Thailand for four years while on assignment for the American Embassy.  While there we were exposed to all levels, including the finest, in Chinese cuisine.  A few years after retiring we moved to Phoenix and, for one reason or another, have been disappointed in the quality of Chinese cuisine found here.  That is, until last Sunday when we accepted a recommendation to try The Gourmet House of Hong Kong with friends.  We ordered several of the soups and entrees.  Prices were reasonable, service was excellent and all items were quickly served piping hot.  This first experience here brought back wonderful memories of the lengthy time we spent in Asia.  Items we ordered were Wonton Soup, Hot and Sour Soup, Green Curry Pork Clay Pot, Egg Rolls, Crab Puffs, Kung Pao Shrimp, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Peking Duck and Almond Chicken.  All were authentic in quality and flavor and will most surely be ordered and enjoyed again as we continue to explore the restaurant's lengthy menu.  This restaurant receives our best recommendation."
5,"Beautiful, big, free to go in, calming, wonderful.  If I lived in Madison, I'd go sit and read by the serene pools throughout the summer."
1,"Boo!  This bar does not have anything going for it.  The place is tiny, and the karaoke painful.  On a Saturday night, only one other party was present with my group of 10.  Yet, the two bartenders on duty still found it difficult to make sure everyone's needs were tended to.  The location is very hard to find as well; I wouldn't have made it without additional directions from a friend.   When I finally did arrive after my 45 minute drive at 10:00p.m., I found out that the kitchen was already closed.  Weak.  I will not return.  Oh!  Did I mention that I was charged for the soda I ordered at the bar?  Generally the soda is free of charge at most establishments, when you are with a group of drinkers."
5,"A trip to this place is fun and entertaining.  I could walk the isles for an hour just looking at everything.  If you love Mexican food you gotta come here.  And the market has the lowest prices for vegetables.  Cucumbers 6 for $1.00 and radishes 3 for $1.00!  I bought a large package of chicken breasts (5 big breasts) and they were only $4.32!  Went home and roasted them up the oven for chicken tacos.  The chicken was perfect.  Next time I'm there my plan is to stock up on chicken breasts for the freezer.  Did I mention the bakery?  Anyway, it's all good."
1,closed!!!!!
1,"I was so excited to check out this store. Living in a vintage building and flush with cash, I felt it was the best prospect for furnishing my apartment. 

However after spending a few minutes in the store I felt cold, alienated and stupid,
For starters I was never greeted, my presence acknowledged, or even asked how my day was. The store was empty upon my arrival, and it was not until I dared to touch an item that my presence was acknowledged....albeit with a condescending and rude outburst by the stores owner. 

I thought the furniture was vintage and original....apparently they refinish and refurbish furniture and pass it off as found vintage. I was told by the owner that most of e furniture was recently shellacked....and was not in display condition. 

I also had the unfortunate experience of asking the staff about several pieces I was interested in. Between eye rolls and deep sighs I was told of the inaccuracies in my question, yet never told if I could purchase the items or not. After being deemed too dumb to engage in a conversation by the woman minding the store I was handed over to the stores owner with a sigh, an eye roll, and a rather condescending ""do you want to handle this?"". The stores owner than continued to alienate and insult me, making me feel dumb and rather small. 

It seems as though the storefront is a showroom for their online sales, as most items are not for sale...and anything that is worthwhile is plastered with ""do not touch"" signage. Very unhospitable for a furniture store, as I usually like to sit in something before I purchase it. 

I'm not going to even go into the prices, which seem as alienated from reality as the stores owner or his assistant; two ageing hipsters locked in a battle for who could be snootier or more pretentious. 

Aside from the nasty staff, the lack of  hospitality and the god-awfull smell inside the store I would say the store was acceptable. 

I'm sure this store will survive, as most online customers probably don't know that they are getting refurbished furniture stored in a putrid cat-urine smelling environment and sold by condescending belittling better-than-thou hipsters. 

......avoid this store, check out the wonderful vintage stores elsewhere in town."
1,"Traveling all the way from Chandler to this place to find out for myself the greatness as advertised AND... we walk in at 4:25 and begin to look and are informed ""We are closed now. Thank you. We will give you a catalog and we will ship to you.""  

As we explained we just traveled 30 miles to get here AND one of us traveled from California, we were given, ""We are closed at 4:30.  Thank you.""

Really?  We couldn't take five minutes to get to shears which is what we went for.  Nope.  This place didn't want our business.  They were closed.  (five minutes early.)

I won't go back.  Lots of places sell pet supplies and I don't need to go here again."
5,Awesome service and the food is great! The alfredo is a bit lighter than Olive Garden which I personally like and the breadsticks are to DIE FOR. Also if you save your receipt there is a website to fill in a survey and you get a free spaghetti/sauce entree (regular sized which is good sized) for the price of a drink (turns out to be less than $2)! This is a great deal because even if you do this they give you another receipt and you can keep getting the deal. Also if you go before 3 they have a good lunch special which is 2 1/2 portions of pasta/lasagna and a drink for $5! Great fast restaurant and the manager is phenomenal!
5,"Every time my boyfriend and I eat here, it has been great. We really enjoy the steamed dumplings and hot and sour soup. The staff is very friendly, too."
5,"Parsonage was a perfect fit for my recent trip. What it is: warm, quaint, charmingly old, affordable, homey, accommodating of diet. What it is not: posh, uber-modern, sleek, extravagant.
Has wifi. Has a (very well-mannered & clean) dog. Street parking. Does not have private bathrooms for each room, so be sure to check on that when booking if it's important to you.

Craig the owner and Coriander the springer spaniel were a warm greeting party. Craig went out of his way to make me feel comfortable with the house, the amenities, where to find him if I needed something, etc. I called him later that night after I realized I had accidentally left without a key, and he told me exactly where he would hide one outside for my return. It felt less like paid lodging, and more like staying with distant relatives. 
Our group had some gluten-sensitive members and some lactose-sensitive members, so Craig made sure that each breakfast had options for everyone. One morning, the power went out around 5am before he could cook the breakfast casserole, so he ran down to a bakery and brought back an improvised meal of fruits and a kringle (?), a local specialty. The weather was nice, so we spent plenty of time on his newly renovated screened-in porch listening to music while we sipped coffee and rubbed Coriander's belly."
5,Let me say that this is by far the best Thai food I have had in Phoenix. The atmosphere is great very friendly staff we were seated right away and made to feel right at home. I had the strawberry Champagne Martini it was very well made. I must say this place is great for a first date anniversary or valentines the owner is wonderful I recommend this place as a romantic spot for a couple. I will continue to go back as long as they are opened.
1,"Ok...First off I have to say I don't usually judge a place off the reviews and like to give it a shot. Well this was a bad idea... especially on an anniversary dinner celebration. Please be advised that the bad reviews are indeed true. We have eaten the food through their catering and it is delicious, so this makes me think all the energy is expelled here alone? Like the other reviews had said this is a creepy outdated awkward place that doesn't have any background music playing at all. So yes the tables are very close together with no music so imagine how uncomfortable that will be. We immediately ordered martinis to try and ease the mood. My dirty martini was garnished with tiny olives on a sandwich pick for an upscale price. The server also spilled most of my wife's martini during her trip to the table saying how it was ""overfilled."" We received a basket of bread that was burnt and unappealing which ended our idea of a maybe hopeful outcome. We were both confused because the dinner menu was nothing like we had eaten through catering. The server informed us that we had probably meant to dine at the ""bistro,"" and was happy to transfer us over next door. Feeling questionable that it would be any better we paid our tab and agreed to go take a table they were holding for us. 

We then walked over to the bistro side of the restaurant only to be disappointed once again.  Packed in like a meat house and sat there for 15 minutes without being asked if we'd like a drink we decided to walk out. They have again an awkward system of seat yourself and apparently serve yourself as well? We were so confused by all the groups of people lining outside to get in this place. We were more than willing to give up our table to the next unfortunate guest. 

The parking lot is also a joke like a previous person had reviewed. It is only valet and gets backed up by the cars coming in and the one attendant trying to run the place. Some lady thought I was a valet driver and proceeded to yell at me because I was standing around not helping her. 

We are in our late 20's and knew we were in ""Snotsdale"" all the way."
5,"I am a native New Yorker where the best Chinese food exists in almost every corner.  There is no such thing as bad Chinese food in NY.  I tried the chinese food here and it is EXCELLENT.  Had the egg drop soup and the won ton soup.  The wonton soup was off the charts. Wonderful flavorful broth with a truly meaty wonton with very light dough.  Amazing.
Also had the chicken with honey walnuts.  I couldn't believe the amount of walnuts given as well as the lightness of the batter.  We also had beef chow fun with gravy.  As good as it gets.  Of course the place is not upscale but I didn't go there to eat the walls, tablecloths or the booths.
It's a place with delicious food and good value.  The people were all very personable and polite.  They answered the many questions we had since it was our first time there.  We also had dessert.  The darkest chocolate ice cream I have seen in a long time.  Yummy.  All this for under $25.  Can you believe it?  Get there!"
5,"This review is for Oakhouse @ the Capitol Square Farmers' Market (CSFM) location.

They are not exactly an underground bakery at the Farmers' Market,  but they certainly don't get their deserved props.  Oakhouse's delights include breads, donuts, scones and specialties are loaded.

There are other bakeries at the market including Stella's.  Based on the crowds and the number of reviewers on Yelp, Stella's gets all the love.   However, based on my consumption of their breads and pastries while also comparing prices and customer service, Oakhouse backhands Stella's with a silicone pastry brush (granted, Stella's has the moistest and most flavorful cheese danishes in the area).
 
I have always appreciated Oakhouse's efficiency and consistency.  They are very organized package bakery perfectly.  I never had anything smushed by being jammed in (like other places).  They rarely struggle with stocking or maintaining an attractive display.  I have never felt ignored or frustrated by cash handlers.  These are amazing accomplishments factoring in the madness of the CSFM.

My change your life recommendation is their Napoleon. It is the eclair's hotter sibling. Oakhouse's offering is a ginormous & gorgeous pile of puff pastry, vanilla cream and vanilla/chocolate glaze decadence.  The layer offers dynamic and perfect flavor combinations vs. the eclair's often disappointing cream to pastry ratio.

Next time you go to the CSFM... sting Stella's and make a beeline to Oakhouse.  They may be -1 on product marketing, but more thank make up for it on their delicious delivery.  Once you save time, a little cash and make your sweet tooth sparkle, you can thank me later."

Or something but I ended up with a bean and potato burrito... And some Sour rice pudding I'm disappointed ... American 
Based businesses go to great lengths to 
Accommodate Spanish  speaking  people
Can we at least get a English understanding employee that takes our 
Orders ...."
5,I love the food here! I had some sort of delicious fried pancake stuffed with shredded meat & cheese. They were called Pupusas. I cant wait to go back  :P I'm seriously jonesing for some more of those meat pancakes.... I need more like now!
1,"SERVICE SCAM ALERT!

I went to have my car serviced from a light that came on.  The next day they called me to tell me the problem and added that my oil pan and radiator where leaking badly and that I needed to replace my Radiator and pull the oil pan to replace the gasket at a cost of near $2,000 total.  What I found odd was that my 7 year old car had not dropped anything in my driveway or garage.

I decided to not have the work done by them and took it to another garage to have looked at.  They told me both where fine and that I had been lied to.

Since I have kept a drip pan under my car and after months, still not a single drop of oil or radiator fluid.  While it is there, I had them change a belt which clearly was not done as this is NOT a new belt.

I will never go back under any circumstances."

1,"Let me explain the 1 star ....

I've been to Scott's a few times before ... LOVED IT! I've sat outside, ordered to go but never have I sat inside until last week.

Was visiting with friends and we got a booth, placed our orders ... started to chit-chat and out of the corner of my eye, I see something on the wall. No! Couldn't be! Why yes, it was your friendly neighborhood roach! And he brought a friend! We gals stopped talking midstream, looking around to see if anyone else saw what we did. Why yes!! our server saw the two unwelcome guests as she was standing at the food delivery window. Guess what she did??! Nothing. Until we pointed them out and rapidly moved to another table.

Honestly, we all were wigged out. Talk about an appetite lost! Too bad. I had totally enjoyed Scott's up until then. 

Most likely will not be back."
5,"Old school barber shop. Clean and cozy. Pool table. This place is busy, having an appointment is a a very good idea. Competitive pricing. Cesar is a very talented barber with superb customer service skills. One of the best cuts I have ever had, possibly the best. Highly recommended."
5,"If you want to sweat, exercise, and have fun they have it all.  They have free weights, universal machines, treadmills, stair climbers, elliptical machines, bikes, a running track, basketball courts, volleyball courts, an indoor soccer field, an indoor pool and outdoor water park, aerobic classes, massage services, personal trainers, racquetball courts, a conference room, a full service bar, a flat grill menu, and probably much more."
1,"I very rarely eat fast food, but I was craving some crunchy chicken goodness, with a biscuit and slaw. The only think awesome about the place? SPORKS (why haven't they ever become mainstream, the world may never know)! They were OUT of biscuits and dropped my change onto the pavement without offering to make it right. They may be right down the street from me... but I will be sure to stick to local mom and pop shops going forward."
1,"First off there is plenty of parking in the back of the place and everybody is very friendly.
Now that said, service was very poor.  We showed up as a party so I knew there would be a wait for seating, once seated it took over 15 mins for the wait staff to bring us water, another 5-10 for drink orders.  By the time the food showed up I was starving and looking forward to tasting what was promised to be outstanding Thai food. If you want good Thai, go somewhere else.  there was no heat to the food even for the items that were listed as Thai hot.  When our food arrived my girlfriend and I dived right in, and immediately stopped and exchanged looks (the one that asks 'is yours as bad as mine?' The prices for the less then mediocre food is a bit too high.
Overall, service staff was very friendly and once the food showed up they were quite attentive, but waiting for an hour after seating to get bland food is unacceptable.  We will not be going back again, I love Thai food and there are far better places to go and have an enjoyable meal."
5,I love this place!!!! It's an authentic hole in the wall kind if place with the best Cajun food in Wisconsin. I have been to New Orleans and eating here takes me right back! The food is fresh and delicious! My favorite way to treat myself. Highly recommend
5,"Colin M. did a masterful job filling you in on the facts about this business, so check out his review.  I can only second what he said.  

This is a real camera shop, stocked to the gills with lots of top-of-the-line stuff.  It would be easy to be intimidated but don't let that keep you from going into this fine establishment.

I have bought a few things here and they have always been very helpful and friendly.

You can find better prices on the internet, but no instant gratification on the internet.  And who is going to help you with a problem or answer a question when you have one?  Who will repair or clean your camera for you?  No, we need to support our local shops and if it means paying a few percentage points more, it's worth it."
1,"Worst customer service ever!  Completely disgusted with the service received at this VA hospital...Operators blind transfer you to other departments that hang up on you...First time registering?  Expect to be put on a 3 to 6 month waiting list just to talk to someone to set up an appointment no matter how bad you need to see a DR..

Veterans DESERVE better than this!!"
5,"Monty's is obviously a popular and beloved place, judging by the number of reviews, and rightly so. Hard to beat the combination of an old-school setting and really good food. The only knock against it is the crowds, especially for weekend breakfast. But do make an effort to have breakfast there sometime - the donut French toast is fantastic. They also have great pies and desserts, and they do all the diner standards really well."
1,This station is ridiculous and infuriating
1,"Is is awful customer service, and the people do not wear gloves.

do not go there."
5,"I love this place!

I really feel like the view & sound from nearly all seats is good (I've been on all levels, lol). 
There are different vendors that sell food and drinks in the halls past ticketing. The variety depends on the event. You'll find a normal mix of concession stand foods, and if you're lucky, Wendell's Pretzels will have a stand. Alcoholic beverages are normally sold. They are not big on mixed drinks or coffee options, but you're in downtown Phoenix..... Once you walk out you have lots of options, so just have a beer or a coke and bide your time ;) 

Parking is EASY. It's literally surrounded. If you've never been it's easy to get scared when you're driving up because you start to see EVENT PARKING signs blocks away, but fear not! There is plenty of parking directly across the street North and West of the building. You do have to pay for parking, of course, but it's normally no more than you would have had to pay if you'd parked 3 blocks away :)

My only gripe? Starbucks has been removed from the entrance and replaced with a burger joint :( 
It boggles the mind, I know!"
1,"ZERO stars. I brought my $600 Swiss army watch in as I needed to have a number placed back on the dial after a drop. Should have been a quick, cheap job. I jut picked it up and it looks like crap. There is excess glue all around the numbers, which they say ""I have to live with"". As I was making my case with the Asian lady who owned the place, one of the other workers was snickering in the background. 

Not only that, this simple job took 3 weeks to complete as they had to send it to California to fix because they did not have to tools to put the watch back together. Worst of all, the crown/pin was not attached properly and is loose. This place needs to be put out of business. 

Bottom line, Do not trust them with your jewelry even for seemingly simple jobs."
1,"Average services. 
The doctor i met wasn't that helpful & courteous. He was always in a hurry. Never spent more than 2 minutes with me in any of the visits. He felt irritated by the normal questions i asked. 
He didn't give a clear enough idea about my condition. I had to virtually dig information from him.

I don't feel confident enough about the treatment i've received here.
Won't recommend this place to anyone."
5,"Wow!  Huge selection of guitars, base guitars and amps. I mean huge! A guitar lover's dream. Very friendly and knowledgable staff. I have heard that ""Sid"" can fix anything. He worked for Good N Loud music for decades before they closed. This store is not easy to find, but call ahead for directions. Newer chain stores in town might be shiny on the surface, but this place is a gem with depth and character."
5,Authentic Hopi piki bread sold here in the city of Phoenix... A must try for the adventurous foodie. As for Native Arts & Culture it is the next best place to be for art during the Heard Indian Art Market
1,"Will never return the this establishment again!

I have been coming to this AJ's for a couple years but unfortunately I will not be returning. When I first started shopping here it was a pleasant experience but over time the customer service got worse. I am not sure if this was due to new employees or management. Although, I must blame management because the attitudes and treatment that I received usually travels from the top down. I had the most issues with a couple employees that work in the deli area. They were both always rude, short, and unpleasant. Every time I said hello to one of the women she NEVER responded. Not so much as a head nod to acknowledge my presence. I brought this to the attention of a cashier and she told me that she would speak to the manager about the service. I continued to go to AJ's but nothing changed and I received bad service over and over again. The last straw for me happened last week. I went to the deli area to get breakfast. I greeted one of the deli workers and she AGAIN said nothing. I was sure that this was on purpose and not her just having a bad day because it had happened so many times before. I asked her why she never responds and seems to have bad customer service. She dismissed me and said ""actually, I was just about to ask you how you day was going"" I thought this was amusing considering she just neglected to respond to my greeting... I told her that she had done this on a number of occasions and it was quite frankly rude and disappointing. She then jumps to want me to get my manager... Like she could care less about fixing the situation for the customer, apologizing, or making things right. 

Super disappointed with my treatment at the AJ's. Will stay away from here from now on and I would definitely NOT recommend anyone else to shop here. A number of employees could care less about you, your hard earned money, or treating with respect and dignity. Management obviously doesn't follow up with complaints properly as well."

5,"Tonight, I cheated on Eliana's with Guanaquito. I still feel a bit guilty, as I've been with Eliana's for years, but when Guanaquito does it better in almost every way, how can you fault me? 

If you blink, you'll miss it- on McDowell, between the Gourmet House of Hong Kong and Arizona Endoscopy Services. You need to park in back, accessible from a driveway before you pass by the dully colored sign for Guanaquito.

Like Eliana's, it's Salvadoran cuisine, but there are so many more options at Guanaquito. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and based on tonight's sampling, Hubby and I will be back often to work our way through the menu. I had the ensalada drink and Hubby had the Horchata, which the waitress patiently explained was different from Mexican Horchata. It sure was- maybe it was the morrow seed that made it so unique. 

For his entree, Hubby had the equivalent of the sampler platter- a tamale (again, quite different from a Mexican tamale- softer and creamier), 2 pastales (meat pies) and 2 pupusas (stuffed, grilled tortillas). Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked. It did not overwhelm the taste of the pupusas, and added a nice crunch and zing. 

The only thing I found that Eliana's did better than Guanaquito was the flan. Guanaquito's texture was off, but the flavor was acceptable.

I suppose I'm willing to share my new love with all of you- but be forewarned- she's a saucy mistress you'll be compelled to visit again and again. Oh- and she's cheap, too. Hubby and I got out of there for $24 (and that includes the extras I got to round out my leftovers for lunch tomorrow!)."
5,"Dropped in late Sunday afternoon after shooting photos for a few hours. Was tired and welcomed warmly by Arthur behind the bar. He introduced himself and shook both and my photo buddies hand. 

While I had only a Coke it was refreshed with a new one when I got to about 1/2 way. My buddy ended up ordering two club sandwiches and judging by the fact that a) he ordered two and b) the plate looked mighty clean they were pretty darn yummy. 

I've been the Majerle's before this visit was very nice and I would definitely come back...will come back this time with an appetite."
1,"The food was pretty decent, but the waitresses were inattentive. No ambiance. Good green tea. They tried to commit our order to memory, which was a colossal failure. Both orders were slightly wrong."
1,"I don't know what I am doing writing a review for this store that no one (at least no one with any ability to change anything there) will ever read.  Nevertheless, I came, I saw, I left empty handed as nothing (in truth, not one little thing) in my entire basket rang up as it was marked on the shelf.  I don't know if it is incompetence, stupidity, or a laudable ""I don't give a flying f"" attitude that makes this the worst Michaels in the area, but I am not sure I have the time to devote to studying the subject matter.  

I think my favorite part of today's experience was when the third item rang up wrong and I told the cashier, she said ""oh"" and looked blindly like a deer in headlights. No ""I'll check on that for you,"" no ""do you still want it,"" just a blank stare.  

Sadly, I'll be back next week because this is the closest one when I am out and about.  But seriously, as soon as I find an acceptable online substitute, I am outta here."
1,"If you're eating here because you've never been to Chase Stadium, walk in, see the stadium, take your picture and get the hell out.  I just saved you about two hours of frustration. You are welcome.  Or you can dine here, like my wife and I regrettably did.  We walked in, and requested to sit by the window... They told us it would be five minutes so we told them no problem at all.  We sat at the bar for 10 minutes, and though the bartender did wave at us, he never took our order.  Then the manager finally came and sat us at a regular table.  I told him we had been waiting for the table with a view, and it was almost as if I had asked him for his social security number.  He fumbled his words, and hesitantly spit out the words ""I have a waiting list""... There were three empty tables and the restaurant was not full AND THEY DONT TAKE RESERVATIONS! So...WTF???  So we waited a bit longer and finally the nervous un assertive manager found us a table.  Cool...now we have been seated and decided to leave that little first impression behind us.  that's when we met our waitress.  Literally had to tell her every aspect of her job, step by step.  It was like we were training her on her first day of a waitress.  I literally would have gotten my food faster if I was waiting in line for a dodger dog on opening day....and only one hotdog stand was open."
5,"As a former employee (8 years) back when Joe H. owned it and Larry taught me to butcher, it warms my heart that this place is still in existence (I still have my Jay Rath designed butcher paper window sale signs from my last week working there).  I grew up buying mainly candy, but occasionally milk, and eggs for my mother as one of the neighborhood kids/'weasels'.  Great store, great neighborhood.  Best homemade brats in the universe, excellent deli, nice people have always run the place.  I've been/lived all over the United States now, there really isn't a better place to buy the basics than the Regent Food Market, ""Joes"", ""The Little Store"".  It is a slice of Americana that doesn't exist much anymore.  Keep up the great work to everyone that is keeping it ALIVE, goodonya."
1,"Today I stopped at University Ave location, where I often get my car washed! The guy at front who took my order (Paul) was extremely RUDE to me for driving off while he was talking to another customer. He started banging on my car, yelling at me ""Where are you going, I haven't finished with you"". I was in shock with his approach and told him that i did not appreciate his attitude and he replied that he did not do anything wrong, so he did not even apologize! I went inside to talk to a manager (Jeff) who was not really into listening to my story and told me that Paul was just trying to stop me and give me the papers I need to show at the check out desk. At this point I was extremely upset with Paul's and Jeff's customer service, I paid for my ""Diamond Pkg"" and waited for my car to be finished. As soon as I walked in my car I saw dirty spots from the interior and dust all over the dashboard, I felt no scent of vanilla which I asked for and also paid for! I will never go back to that place and I'll make sure everyone I know to never set a foot at that place!!!! Horrible, horrible customer service!!!!!"
1,"Probably the worst Italian food I've ever had!! And those who know me, know I have been to PLENTY of Italian restaurants. So to say this place had the worst food, trust me it was that bad. My friend commented on the lasagna that it didn't even taste as good as Stouffers frozen. The Chicken Marsala I ordered was so tough, I couldn't even cut it! I definitely could have done 100 times better. The atmosphere is great, but the service doesn't support such a cool looking restaurant. I'm not sure how long it took to get a glass of wine and beer from the waiter but it semed like forever! There is no parking in the front so you have to drive around to the back which is a tad unsavory honestly. How do you mess up Italian food THAT bad?? Really! Go somewhere else. Do not take anyone but your kids here and order something like spaghetti and meatballs!! Then cross your fingers!"
1,"This is THE WORST strip club I have ever been to. I have been to a lot of seedy clubs as well. I've been to clubs where every chick is coked out of her mind to the point where she can't even dance, clubs where chicks are dancing around while the other strippers are watching their babies, even places where girls say they have been raped by club owners. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is as bad as this club. 

The New York City bouncer out front was a nice guy, and thats where it stopped. The girls here are downright disgusting. These girls don't even look good enough to work the counter at MVD. The place is also crawling with undesirables at all times of the day and night. Their drinks are about $7 for a captain and coke, there were no girls dancing when we were there, the three girls who were working were basically asking if we wanted dances and when I said no, then rolled their eyes and walked away. Well, maybe these girls could dance on stage and THEN ask for a private dance... I want to see what you're made of first.

The dress code out front, the disgusting women, the attitude from bartenders, and the overall grossness of this place earn it a one star. It would be negative one if it were an option. Hi LIter, Bombshells, and even Cheetah's are a ton better than this place. They are cheaper, have better talent, and are very friendly places. Even the overpriced Bourbon Street would be a better bet than this."
5,"Go-to meal: cheddar butter burger, fried cheese curds, and flavor of the day custard.

The difference between a deluxe burger and cheddar butter burger is that in the deluxe, you'll get American cheese.  And you have to pay 25 cents extra to add lettuce, tomato, etc. to the cheddar butter burger.  File that away in your memory bank."
5,"Went back for dinner the other night.  Party of four for drinks and food. It was great ... We had The Koko, Fried Green Tomato sandwich, Avacado Po'Boy and Little Birdy. Rounded out with Carol Fries and Brussels Sprouts. Mmmmmm, Mmmmmm Good.  Added some drinks and friendly banter from Morgan and a good night was had by all!  

Thanks Welcome Diner for a great night!"

1,"I went to an urgent care for a sprained foot. The urgent care provided me an air cast ankle stirrup (even though I sprained my foot!) that sells at Wal Mart for about $47 retail . Hangar Orthotics dba Elite Care billed my insurance $149.00 Insurance paid 74.50 as that was deemed reasonable and customary. I received a bill for the balance which is illegal in AZ where I live.

I called up to dispute the amount, and although my call was third I have been waiting 94 minutes with an automated message saying my call is next ... it is now 4:59pm on Friday, I am doubting I will get an answer even though it has been saying my call is next for over an hour.

5,"My family has been going to Angelo's for as long as I can remember. They have the best pizza I have ever tasted and the wait staff knows our family and is always super kind as well as attentive. (Apparently?) they don't take reservations, so there may be a bit of a wait, but it is SO TOTALLY WORTH IT and if you're in a rush I'm sure you can call ahead so they put your name on the list if you're planning on going on a weekend night. I have never found a pizza to match theirs and have been all over the world. Their speghetti is AMAZING and I have a soft spot for their garlic bread and breadsticks. I'm a huge fan of their house salad with sun-dried tomato dressing. My family always gets the Vegetarian special, with no onions, no artichokes, add sausage. The angelo's special is pretty good too. They don't make their stuffed (deepizza anymore, which"
5,"I spent over $3000 on my car at this place since July. Why the 5 stars? Because I was not ripped off, everything was explained to me...step by step if needed (and I did need it - ha), nobody in this shop is a douchebag, the other customers are even nice, they don't try to rip off the ladies, they don't try to upsell me crap I don't need unless I ask if there's other crap I might need, and I'm pretty sure if I hadn't been out of town they would've let me seen the damage to my engine and walked me through the process if I'd asked so I could do my nerdy internet search on serpentine belts and motor mounts and all that other crap that was wrong.

I knew they weren't effing with me because when I bought the car a few years ago the creepy dealership supposedly changed the motor mounts. When Virginia Auto Service identified a problem with (and subsequent damage as a result of) the motor mounts, I knew it was true, and I thought about that tug in my stomach I ignored when I bought the car that told me NOT TO BUY THE CAR OR TRUST THIS CREEPY CAR SALESMAN. 

Seriously, if you have a problem with something this shop tells you all you have to do is ask and see if they can work with you - find different parts, develop a plan to do repairs in steps...ask your grandpa to come in and hand them wrenches or wipe the sweat from their brow so you can have a discount as they diligently work to repair the vehicle you neglected and ignored for over 2 years knowing full well you were driving a heap. 

When they quoted me a price over the phone I said ""THERE'S NO WAY I CAN PAY FOR THAT RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NO CHANCE I CAN PAY THAT"" while my head was exploding and my face was melting (at work). I don't know if they want this advertised, but they let me leave my car there for over a month (closer to two months) while I made gradual payments and they did the repairs. My job sent me to BFE Texas and Virginia Auto Service just let me leave it there because it couldn't be driven. That's effing CLASS, folks.

Because they are so awesome I tell everyone I know about this experience, I write positive reviews whenever I get the opportunity, and I will not be taking my crappy little car anywhere else."

1,"Ok - so I used to live minutes from china town in NYC...  so I'm perhaps a little spoiled.  I realize that.   I still have not found a Chinese food place here in phoenix that I'm crazy about...I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm not gonna.
That being said... this is by far the *worst* Chinese I've had here so far.
They are right around the corner from where i live so i decided to give it a try for take out one night...
they got our order wrong, it took forever, and it was completely flavorless...  I had a few bites and lost my appetite. 
Maybe I ordered the wrong things...  maybe I was there on an off night...  
who knows.  But as far as I'm concerned - Vegetable lo mien shouldn't be that difficult to get right.  My boyfriends meal (forget what he got) was no better.

1,"TASC, Inc. - Treatment Assessment Screening Center, a.k.a. scary drug testing place at the end of my block where I had to go to pee in a cup for my new job.  I venture down to the end of my block in my suit at 8:30 a.m.; and of course, even though it's supposed to be open at that time, all the door's are still locked.  None of the doors are clearly marked, so I wander around and end up at a door marked ""business"" something.  The door's locked, but I look inside and see a young woman who looks at me and points upstairs.  Keep in mind, I'm in a suit.  So I walk upstairs and form a line behind another guy who's waiting in front of another locked door.  

Fifteen minutes go by, and now there's a line of about 15 people, most of them in street clothes, and I'm standing there in a suit.  Great.  Finally the door opens (phew) and we all shuffle in and the receptionist hands us clipboards with forms to fill out.  I start filling out the form, but after trying to figure out why there's so many questions about my drug use, family life, and court mandates, I realize I must have the wrong form.  I walk up to the receptionist, tell her I'm from the court, and she laughes and says I'm in the wrong office, I need to go back downstairs.  

So I go downstairs, back to the same door I had originally gone to, and the young woman that originally pointed me upstairs laughs and asks me why I went upstairs.  Seriously?  But it doesn't end there, because then the woman hands me a cup, and I stand there like a moron because I thought they were going to draw blood or something (and I'm not sure why I thought that).  But of course I went to the bathroom right before I left my house, so I had to leave, drive to Starbucks, grab a bottle of water and a cup of coffee, drink them both down, and then head back to TASC to finish.  And by this time, it's about 10:00 a.m. and I have to park halfway down my street b/c tons of people are there to get tested - not the nicest business/clientele to have at the end of one's block.  Still, I suppose it's got to be somewhere ...."
1,"Wow, I have to write this review immediately, so I can begin the process of purging the memory of this dentist visit forever.

I came here on a referral from a co-worker. I was lazy about researching through the insurance site and he also lives near our office so I knew he had one I could pop over to on a lunch break. His referral was for Dr. Angela Relf. I Googled the number and made the appt. - they were able to see me the same week. 

When I pull up to the group of offices, I walked into the wrong one. The guy in there said, ""Girls Scouts office is next door."" Ha, that's funny. I explained who I was looking for and he said that was on the other side of the building and that it's not Relf there anymore, but a Dr. Jafari. So I get to the right building and Dr. Relf's name is boldly displayed on the window, but ""Weldon Dental Care"" is on the big sign out front. Whatever, it's a dentist, right?

I'll start with the good stuff, because the bad stuff is really bad.

Good - everyone, from the admin to the tech to the Dr. himself was very nice. And the quickness in getting an appt. that I mentioned before was appreciated.  that's it.

Bad - Wow, ok. First the cleanliness was non-existent. The waiting area seemed fine, but the clientele that came and went as I waited seemed homeless. 

I noticed a sign directing to the bathroom, so I figured I'd hit that up before we got started. I had to walk through the work area to get to the bathroom and was surprised at how run down it was back there - dirty floors and scuffs and holes on/in the walls. The bathroom was not very clean wither but I thought I was just being judgmental.

When I came out, a very nice young man said they were ready to start and led me directly to a room with a very old chair and even older equipment. The tech was sweet, but seemed inexperienced, borderline unprofessional. I know those plastic mouth things are always a drag (for X-rays), but I've never gagged when someone was trying to position it! He apologized and gave me time to recover - again, very nice, but yikes.

He did the X-rays, then said it would take about 30 min for them to ready and left the room. I began to look around at the old and rusty faucets, stains on the counters, filthy (FILTHY) floor and plastic trash can with no bag in it.

 It seemed weird that they had not started the (teeth) cleaning process. I finally flagged down the same tech and asked if I was also scheduled for a cleaning. He looked at my file and said yes, a polishing was to be done. And he moved me to an equally, if not more dirty room. It was so bad - yellowing equipment, grimey floor, grimey equipment - oh, and I found the missing trash bag from the other can - it was PULLED OVER THE BACK AND HEADREST OF MY CHAIR. They were using in lieu of disposable protective sheets made just for that purpose?!! The longer I waited in there, the more nervous I got. I thought back on the clientele and the new doctor and wondered if this was a free clinic that also took regular patients. I considered leaving, but they'd already done X-rays and I'm sure that's the most expensive part of the dentist visit. Would my insurance let me go somewhere else? 

I was texting my co-worker to double check I was in the right place when Dr. Jafari showed up. He was very nice, but seemed unsure about what the next step was. And why was the Dr. doing the cleaning? Isn't that what the tech does? He opened a pack of clean tools and then set them on the table without putting a sheet under them first - what the hell is the point of that? He (without gloves) moved the light and equipment around into the right position (handles on the light had a weird plastic sheet over it, not a disposable full cover you usually see), then put gloves on and touched all the stuff he had touched without them. ugh!

He barely scraped at my teeth (I'm used to them really getting in there and taking care of business, and that's when I used to go regularly - what was this guy doing?) and when the X-rays came back he said I was cavity-free (which is good because I would not have believed anything if they said I need extra work). He seemed knowledgeable to some degree (ex: my gums always bleed when they clean and he went through the possible causes, they were exactly what I'd always heard).

When he was done scraping the tech finished up with the polishing. He changed gloves when he sat down (thank god) and he too seemed to be taking it light on the job. No suction-spray system was used until well into the process. By then I had given up they even possessed such ""high-tech"" tools and had swallowed a mouthful of that gritty paste and saliva. 
OMH - I almost forgot the best part - when he asked if I wanted glasses to protect my eyes/face from the splash-back, he left the room and came back with a pair of SUNGLASSES I had noticed sitting on the counter in the first room. I think they were his. Unbelievable."
1,"The security guard who works at the front desk is rude, unfriendly and offensive as can be.  He seems to think he owns the place and bosses people around."
5,"When I think of ""Hampton Inn,"" I think budget hotel. The decor at this Hampton Inn certainly did not suggest this. With the dark wood furniture, white sheets, classy black & white photographs accompanying the room numbers, and modern lobby, I felt like I was at a Sheraton or Westin. The staff was friendly and considerate too - we asked for a room that wasn't facing the highway and she took it a step further by giving us a room away from the area with lots of kids.

The free breakfast was also a step up from your usual continental breakfast - it included sausage and eggs that you can make a biscuit sandwich with, among a variety of other usual items. We didn't get to use their pool but it looked nice from afar. The base price was $119 but we had a 20% off coupon through Orbitz."
5,"This place has been here for over 45 years and a recent visit reminded me of why this place has lasted for as long as it has. Super friendly service and tons of supplies you may need. The store is much bigger than the one that used to be on McDowell. Their specialty is Metaphysics, New Age, Paganism and the occult. We were greeted by Roz and Joy who were super friendly and answered all of our pestering questions. Roz even gave us some cold bottled water because it was so hot outside.

They had lots of different statues, but I came here interested if they had any Buddha statues, prayer flags, mala beads or books on the paranormal, which they had all of them! I pondered over some reiki infused scented candles that were only $2 and $15 handmade goblins. They also have a used section of books which is appreciated because sometimes this stuff can get really expensive. 

My partner specifically came here looking for tarot cards which they had in abundance. The ones he ended up liking they had to special order for him, which was nice. If you are looking for essential oils, herbs, kits, graveyard dirt, holy water, charcoal, sage, candles, they have all of that. They also offer readings and classes on things like rootwork, how to read the tarot, candle magick and crystal workshops. The place was a bit confusing to find but it's next to the big tanning shop next door that reads 'TANNING,' and there is a big iron sign that says Alpha Book Center."
1,Holy bad service! Ran out silverware. Forgot order like 3 times. Food cold. Go elsewhere on a sunday morning.
1,"We came in here to have a few drinks before going across the street for dinner. As soon as we sat down at the bar, the bartender (who couldn't speak English very well) comes over. I immediately ask her to relay the happy hour specials. $3.99 house wines, and $2 drafts. My companion has a budlight draft, I choose a house pino grigio. We ended up staying for two rounds. The bartender disapears and we ask the ""manager"" for the check. After he brings it over we notice that my wine was $10 a glass. After explaining to the ""manager"" that we came in here for the happy hour. He says he will go ask the ""owner"" in back. He comes back, shrugs his shoulders and says that there is nothing he can do. Meanwhile the bartender (who can settle this) is still nowhere to be found. I explain to him that I live very close by and usually come here to watch football on sundays, but sadly I will not be returning. He says ""Oh.... let me ask the owner again"" and walks back. At that point, I had enough. It wasn't about the money. I stood up, left money on the bar and walked out. This place is a joke."
5,"Okay, so because I'm so excited to have eaten here, and I want to use obscenities to describe the deliciousness, I have decided to replace any PG-13 words with PG words. And....

This place was flippin' good! I mean, gosh darn! How the heck did they just do that? Each bite made whoopee to my taste buds and stayed around afterwards to cuddle! It's not everyday that I find a restaurant that I absolutely want to be a regular at, but La Tolteca is a restaurant that I can see myself having a healthy relationship with, and, if I'm lucky, possibly growing old with. I'm all for market-style restaurants, and La Tolteca seriously nailed it!

Okay, now that that's out of my system, here's what I tried: I tried the chips and salsas, huevos rancheros and the chilaquiles. The chips were fresh as can be (still warm in the bag), and the salsas...oh the salsas...they were all great, but the stand out had to be the habanero. It was definitely one of the best salsas I've ever had, and my girlfriend considered it the best she had ever had. That's not to be taken lightly because we eat salsa almost religiously. Because my girlfriend got the chilaquiles, I went with the huevos rancheros. They were piping fresh and everything one would expect. The second I cut open the yolk of the egg and saw the yellow and red run together, I knew I was in for a treat. The flavors of that mixed with beans and a little rice were really great! For those of you that have had good huevos rancheros before you'll know what to expect. Alright, and lastly the chilaquiles. In all seriousness, these were the best, and I mean the BEST chilaquiles I've ever had! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in the kitchen, but I suspect a tiny sprinkling of crack right before it was served to us, but that may have just been the garlic. Either way though, it was phenomenal! Every single bite made me so happy, and even after everyone was full at the table, we still managed to pick away at it until it was completely consumed.

Every person reading this needs to do themselves a favor and endure the trip to Central Phoenix for this place. If you love Mexican food (especially chilaquiles), La Tolteca should not disappoint in the slightest."
1,"worst brunch I ever had!

I was hoping for a nice Sunday brunch but was very disappointed. The waitress told us that it is a fourty minutes wait for any order. She suggested pastry even though the cafe was less than one third full (12 people including us).  So we selected two crossants, a quiche and two cups of coffee. Pastries arrived quickly but no coffee.  Crossants were cold and soft, not as good as crossan from Paradise cafe but twice the price. 

Halfway done my croissant I realized I had no napkin. Asked her about coffee she said that it is brewing and need to wait four more minutes.  My husband noticed that the lady behind me complained coffee was too cold and it was then microwaved. He was puzzled as the waitress told us they serve freshly brewed coffee.

 I finished my croossant and had some quiches. finally our coffee came. They were luke warm too, not as hot as from McDonalds. At this point, twenty minutes later after we sat down,  the waitress  told us if we order now she will be able to serve quickly. We were not happy.  We asked her if there was anything we could have done differently to have a proper meal and she said no. 

The worse thing is it destroyed our whole day being treated this way. 

Will not go there ever again!"
1,"I originally moved into Courtney Village Apartments back in September 2010. Despite the sketchy surrounding neighborhood and higher priced rent, it was a nice centralized location that fit my lifestyle at the time. 

I will say that the benefit of location is a huge plus for Courtney Village. You are less than 10 minutes from ASU and oldtown Scottsdale. Less than 30 minutes from almost every part of the valley. 

Another benefit is their dog park. A good core group of residents frequent the dog park multiple times a week. They are very friendly and welcoming to new people and all they ask is that your dog not be a total dick. It gives the complex a greater sense of community.

Unfortunately, those are the only two benefits that Courtney Village offers. The apartment office is rude and unresponsive to resident inquiries. They advertise a ""gated"" community, but will let the gates sit broken and open for weeks at a time, giving anyone the ability to enter the complex. They promise a 48-hour maintenance work order fix, but refuse to co-ordinate their maintenance appointments with the resident's schedule. They expect you to let their maintenance guys have carte blanche access to your home without ever meeting them. They are so committed to this 48 hour time frame that if you try to call a work order in with a desired fix date more than 48 hours out, they will tell you that you need to call back closer to the desired date. 

Another issue with the office is that everyone is in ""cover your ass"" mode. Employees are quick to throw others under the bus for misinformation and also will lie to a resident at the drop of a hat. My last rent check took over four weeks to be cashed by the office. I called after two weeks to make sure my payment was applied. The office assured me that they had cashed the check and that it must be a problem with my bank. Sure enough, once my check was cashed and I looked at the deposit date, it was deposited on the 27th of the month. Maybe instead of lying to a resident, they could just admit that they fucked up instead of leading someone on a wild goose chase with their bank over outstanding checks.

The biggest problem is that Courtney Village believes they have some sort of inflated value based on their apartment's location. They will try to charge you almost $900 a month for a 2 bedroom, 1,050sq ft apartment. They do this despite having a trailer park a block to the west, being 1/4th of a mile away from a complex where two men broke into the apartment of a woman and proceeded to rape and rob her, and also 1/4th of a mile away from a National Guard base where a solider was stabbed while taking out the trash. They refuse to even hire a security guard to do nightly checks, instead relying on the two residents who are Phoenix police members to demonstrate a level of security in the complex that does not exist. Seems like the more the neighborhood goes downhill, the higher they raise their rates. They also won't give any current residents a fair shake when it comes to renewing their lease. My buddy continued to pay nearly $800 a month for the same model unit that they rented to his neighbors for $750 two weeks earlier. Seems that they would rather risk bringing in new tenants at a slightly higher price point than working with current residents. 

This review may seem negative, and in all honesty it is, but this complex is ran by a very negative group of people. They try to work you with their community bullshit, but at the end of the day they could care less if your car is broken into or if the grounds look nice or if your apartment is taken care of. They only care about that rent check being dropped in their mail on the 1st. Avoid the bullshit and find a nicer, safer, cleaner place closer to Scottsdale or ASU for the same price point."
1,"My 1st visit was an oil change for my Wife and once the bill was ready  I went over the bill with them and question what the additional charges where, they took them off, but that's pretty shady. My 2nd visit, took car in for check engine light, diagnosis was a O2 sensor, had to pay a $89 diagnostic fee up front, never had to do this before after it was all done cost were around $300 total. Now 3rd time acceleration issues and I really didn't want to go back to them but my repair shop was closed. So begrudgingly I did, they could not figure out the problem told me I should see my dealer. Took the day off and took my car to my guys at Granite Reef Repair in Scottsdale, they took care of it like it wasn't an issue. Just my opinion but Pep Boys are a shady company, overpriced and for the most part just like Sun Devil Auto repair scams.. I won't go back and I'm happy to let everyone know why."
1,Too expensive and had my computer for over a month for a simple repair! Non-responsive staff. Horrible experience! U could find much better places for computer repairs....
1,Are you serious!!! Stop putting sugar in the gravy!!!! Cali can't do pizza!!!! Nasty!!
1,"I went in the store on Jan 28th to ship a framed print and piece of cement home decor. To have it packed and shipped to Massachussettes was $103. I had very clear instructions to ship the item from the UPS store, using USPS. I had given the clerk my cell phone to copy the address from which she did and everything should have been fine.
Exactly one month later I go to ship just a framed print (same size as the first one). This time I was being charge $118? I asked why this one was costing more than the original shipment which was heavier. I explained what I had shipped previously when the man suddenly remembered that THE PRINT AND CEMENT ITEM I HAD SENT A MONTH AGO WERE STILL THERE! I was told that the address was undeliverable via UPS. We checked the address verified it was correct. I was told they had tried calling me once. They tried calling a number that I never gave them. A number I never heard of, I don't even know where the area code they had is located!
After verifying the information he said he would have it resent the following day. I asked about a refund and was told ""Well I'll have to check, but technically we are still shipping it."" He then walks off. I stand there waiting and he comes back a few minutes later asking if I needed something else. Yeah! How about a time frame? Is he going to call me, should I call him? This was a big refund I was asking for not a couple bucks I could just forget about. He told me to call him later that week. I called three times and went into the store once and he wasn't there any of the times and no one working there would help me. I finally went in yesterday and he was there. I was third in line and by the time I got to the front there were two more people behind me. He said I would need his ""undevoted"" attention and so he needed to help the other people really quickly since he was the only one there. Well he proceeded to help them as well as the other 5 people that walked in after them while I sat and waited. After waiting for nearly 20 minutes he gave me his ""undevoted"" attention which consisted of taking 30 seconds to give me a tracking number  from something I had previously shipped and then another 30 seconds to tell me that he had checked about the refund and was told no because the information was correct and the address is deliverable. OF COURSE THE ADDRESS WAS CORRECT! And since the address was correct and deliverable, how is it NOT their fault that it was still not delivered a month later? How is it not their fault that they had the wrong number for me? How is it not their fault that they never tried to deliver it to the store I shipped it from which is a block away! Ron said he would file an appeal and for me to come back on Friday. But he won't let me talk to anyone else. This is ridiculous"
5,"We have just held a wedding at the University Club and it couldn't have been better.  Our guest list was about 55 people.  The wedding was beautiful; at night, in the large back yard under the lights  The club was decorated for Christmas complete with a fire in the fireplace.  We held the reception inside with a buffet and hor doerves.  Our guests told us this was the best wedding food they had encountered.   The evening was magical.  The food was delicious and the staff couldn't have been more attentive.  The aura was warm and welcoming.  Genie and Karen helped us every step of the way and all of the staff was prompt and courteous with every service.   A simple thank you doesn't seem adequate for the effort they made to make our day special."
1,"The scheduling woman, Annette, is extremely rude and unapologetic.  When scheduling a time to come in to my home for an appointment, they did not provide the 30 minute call ahead they said they would.  She then called to reprimand me for not being there and said that I was being irresponsible.  I tried to let her know that I did not receive the 30 minute prior phone call even letting me know that the technician was going to be there.  She told me I was wrong and refused to believe me.  

While the technician's service was neutral, the scheduling woman was one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had."
5,"This is my absolute favorite restaurant and anytime I come home for a visit I have to stop by to have some Meatless Loaf of the God's or a Gobbler!

Top it all off with a Cup of Mud or an off the hook slice of pie or cake and you have one amazing meal that can only be found in Mad-town."
5,I love this place. The fried dumplings are to die for.
1,"My friend ordered chicken nuggets, and two of them were molded together. I'm vegetarian, so I sat there with my crappy fries but tasty frosty and watched the madness unfold.

As she tore the two melded nuggets away from each other, THERE WAS A GELLY WHITE PASTE THAT DRIPPED OUT. I am literally gagging just recalling the incident, and I almost threw up all over the table.

This exact same scenario happened to my sister, on her totally different box of chicken nuggets 45 second later. Nobody finished our food. We all just left.

There is white gooey crap IN THE FOOD at wendys. 

So incredibly gross. SO gross. Gross. Don't go here, for the love of god!!"
1,This is the second branch of this bank I've tried to go to (to help my Daughter cash a check) that has turned out to be out of business.  I'm tired of wild goose chases.
1,"went there for a working lunch with the marketing department. ordered a salad. started eating, it was okay- tasted like a crappy hooters chicken salad. THEN I NOTICED... a small pearly yellow orange bean looking thing in the salad. i poked it with my fork and then lifted it to my nose to smell it. IT WAS A CHEWED UP PEACH JELLY BELLY JELLYBEAN! IN MY SALAD! i was disgusted. told the waiter, showed it to him and he LAUGHED, as if that was a funny joke between buddies. 

can you picture the fat lady in the back mixing up my salad and a chewed up jellybean from her bag falls into my plate and she just keeps going or doesn't notice?!?! i had to actually request that the salad be taken off of my bill - they were still going to charge me for it.

they offered nothing else, no manager came over to talk to me, nothing... as if it was just another customer complaint. lol NEVER GOING BACK THERE!"
5,"So impressed with this hotel!   I live in Scottsdale but have always been very interested in historic buildings.  I decided to stay at the San Carlos just to check it out.  The San Carlos make you feel like you are stepping back though time!   The decor and room are well kept while the historic aspects are left intact.  The lobby and rooms were beautiful!

The pool was surprisingly modern. It was lite with cobalt blue lights which added a very relaxing feel for our night swims.  

The staff went out of there way to make sure we enjoyed our stay.   While we were swimming the security guard----I think his name was Denis ---checked on us.   He answered many questions we had about the hotel and things to do in downtown Phoenix!   The staff (Bob at the front desk was super nice too) was very friendly and knowledgeable which really added to out overall experience :)

I can't wait to do another staycation at San Carlos!!!"
1,"I chose this motel because it is 3 blocks from downtown. I wanted to be able to walk back and fourth for a couple days. Upon check in I was greeted with zero smiles, and made to feel more like he was doing me a huge favor. The older gentlemen with white hair was very very clear that this was not a ""party"" motel. And that we will get removed immediately if there was even 1 complaint? I found this interesting since I am a mellow 45 year old who does not appear to be a partier in the least bit. He then went over the no smoking policy and that we'd be charged $150.00 cleaning deposit if we smoked. Even though the office smelled of cigarette smoke. LoL....  And nobody in my family smokes. I simply smiled and looked at my wife and said, ""Well, looks like we came to the right place honey""'

I was utterly disgusted at the layer of filth on the outside of the building. I wiped my finger on the outside windowsill and it turned black. Old gum, some kind of splash stains, trash, all in view on the way to the room.  Every outside plastic trash can within view was barely holding together like they had been run over and stood back up. They are cracked to death and appear to be very old as they are faded? 

One of our rooms (we have older kids with us) reeked of cigarette smoke as we entered. I immediately opened the door and cranked the fan to try and air it out. I noticed the batteries were missing in the smoke alarm. I went to the office to report this and was met with apathy from now a female attendant. She told me she could swap out a room and would call me in 20 minutes. I told her that I did not want to get charged with a smoking violation. We went back and hung out in our other room. DISGUSTING. The corners of the rooms floors are filled with lint, dust, and food particles where it looks to never to have been vacuumed.  Stains on the carpet and chair seating area. There were small chunks of seat cushion under the chair in the corner as if had not been moved or cleaned under in a long time.  When I looked behind the tv cabinet in search for an outlet I saw a former tenants Old Spice deodorant covered in dust along with numerous crumpled kleenex? Seriously?  After walking around the room in my socks for about 30 minutes they were black on the bottom. Gross. I can only guess that the cleaning crew blows through each room doing the least amount of work they can. We found evidence that one of our beds sheets had not been changed. 

After an hour I had never received a phone call that was promised. I went back to the front office for some coffee. The same lady was there and I told her to forget changing our room. And that it had aired out pretty good. I actually just gave up and decided to just try and help my family enjoy our few days here. After dealing with the manager who was very clear that we were here for them, and the condition of the room, I knew trying to get them to see reality would be more frustrating that just letting it go.  So I did. I figured I'd inform possible customers of what they might be getting into. And I honestly hope Super 8 contacts the management here and tries to fix these easily remedied issues. 

Later that night after two of my kids showered. their tub (in room 108, the stinking smoke room that still stunk) did not drain. I walked back to the front office and met the lady again. She told me that they only had 1 plunger and that they had given it to another room and that they were asleep already. I now asked for a new room. She told me she would see what she could do and that she would let me know and call me back at my room. I never heard back from them the entire stay. Not to see if we were ok? Not to offer to replace the missing batteries (code violation)?  

The next morning we tried to enjoy the free breakfast. Ok at least they are trying I guess. But when the OJ ran out the white haired guy fixed it but did not say a word to us as we said thank you. He really makes it clear that he just does not enjoy people. 

We will never stay her again. And I feel like we should get a partial refund. I understand things happen. But this place is a joke. I would be embarrassed to work here. And I refuse to believe management doesn't know what is going on. Just hard to believe people can just not care.

UPDATED JANUARY 26TH.
    After returning home 3 outta4 of my kids developed little red bites along the backs of their necks, on their sides and on our 2 yr old under his diaper on his belly. We determined that they were in fact bed bug bites.  Fortunitely they did not make it back to our house. They did end up going away and have not returned since."
5,"Hello Ranch Market, nice to finally meet you ! Since moving to my new hood I have fallen in love with this store. They have things I have never seen before anywhere else. I am so overwhelmed when I go here, I am in sensory overload.

Mexican bread is 5 for $2, bolillos are 6 for $1, tons of seafood, fresh chorizo ( which I have been eating everyday for a week ), tons of snacks packaged by Ranch Market for super cheap, you can get a meal for 4 people for $10 ( carnitas, rice, beans, tortillas ) and tons of other specialty items. The atmosphere is fun and inviting and everyone is friendly. This store has inspired me to create new dishes at home, like my homemade beans and chorizo. 

Go here, eat some of their prepared foods that are inexpensive and delicious OR get some fresh ingredients and make something yummy at home.

See ya soon Ranch Market."
1,"Breakfast is my favorite meal.  I love to go out and eat as much as i love to cook my own.  when eggs are cooked on a surface  that is too hot, they are done on the outside and undercooked on the inside.  

I belong to a group that meets here every week, after last year, i stopped ordering the eggs because they can not prepare them medium.  so today i ventured out.  i asked out waitress how i should order the eggs if i want the whites cooked and the yolk soft.  she replied ""over medium"" - perfect.  when my food arrived, i cut into my egg, as it ran all over my plate, the person sitting next to me asked how i could eat them so raw.  

I simply pushed my plate away, finished the meeting, paid my bill.  I WILL NEVER ORDER FOOD at this place again.  when the kitchen doesnt care what it sends out, all dishes become scary.  I have been here every week for more than 5 years and it doesnt change. this was not an isolated incident."
5,"MEATBALLS!
Bring your radio flyer into the store to load up on all the delicous treats to bring home.  
Olives, Feta, BALLS, sausages, cured meats, pickled veggies, baguettes, hoagie sandwiches, do you want me to go on? 
Lasagna, tortelinni, cheeses soft and hard, crackers from Italy, sauces for your refrigerator, frozen meals for the freezer.
If you can't find a meal here to please everyone, good luck to you.  Friends coming over in an hour?  Pick up some antipasta here, bottle of wine, or two and a loaf of fresh bread.
Boom.  Done. Balls."
5,Tech was on time and very courteous.  Performed the necessary maintenance quickly.  All in all a very good experience.
1,"Talk about rude! I went in to buy three ceiling fans and I felt like the salesperson was laughing at me and mocking me for my decisions and questions. I will never set foot in this store again. I went to a different lighting store where I had great service, better prices and spent close to $1000."
1,Horrible customer svc. Now i shop at Neiman. Bye Saks
1,Owner does not have integrity.
5,"Why watch the game when you can watch the madness unfold in the Duck Blind section? I think the only time I looked at the field is when children dressed as fruits and vegetables began racing around the bases. 

My general admission Duck Blind ticket was $33 for a Friday night game - but the experience of trying to get my money's worth was priceless. All-you-can-eat ballpark food (which is perfectly adequate ballpark food, nothing to rave about) and all-you-can-drink adult beverages (from a fairly extensive beer list)? Challenge accepted. 

There is another Duck Blind section that costs a bit more than the general admission. I think it includes a reserved picnic table and a better view of the game; however, if you're willing to come to the regular Duck Blind section soon after the gates open (90 minutes before the game), you can call dibs on a table in the cheaper section. 

Overall, it was a great value for 4 1/2 hours of food, beverage and entertainment. I won't be back every weekend - for the sake of my waistline - but it's definitely a fun way to spend a summer night in Madison."
1,"Reading the other reviews here makes me think I must have landed in a parallel universe the night we ate here. 

OK, so I'm a Bay Area native and love Sichuan food; I'm white and my girlfriend is Asian. We walk in the door, are seated, and handed the simple menu.  NOTHING of interest on the menu.  We decided on two very basic dishes (General Chou's Chicken and a Sichuan Prawm dish).  The Chicken was atrocious - dry, old-tasting, and nothing but a pile of chicken - no vegetables, no spice, nothing. The shrimp dish was marginally better, but nothing to write home about. 

Meanwhile, everyone at other tables seemed to be ordering stuff that we didn't see on the menu ... ""maybe there's a Chinese menu we didn't see"" we said to each other ... 

On our way out, we saw the 'Chinese' menu ... full of the stuff we were looking for - ""pigs stomach with jalapeno"", etc .  So - I'm willing to believe they have good food, but - WHY oh WHY have a separate 'whites' menu? AND - when a white guy walks in with an Asian lady, WHY not give them the 'Asian' menu?  The 1 star accurately reflects the food we ate, and also applies to the waiter who did not think to offer us the appropriate menus. 

We'll probably head back to Chandler for our next Chinese food experience."
1,"I don't typically review fast food chains but this location just asked for it. I wish I could give one star for this sorry excuse for a fried chicken chain. Not only do they have the WORST customer service ever (well, okay maybe not ever - I think Long Wong's MIGHT still have a slight edge) but they always forget the jalapeños. I mean, ALWAYS. Why is that?!?! And be warned - in this digital age, this company is a dying breed. They absolutely WILL NOT accept digital coupons, it MUST be in paper with NO exceptions. Even when the digital coupons have a coupon code printed in bright red on the top left hand corner and no barcode. Apparently their staff isn't bright enough to tip-tap-type these codes into the magical box of buttons and numbers to make the coupon effective. LAME. After my now second horrible experience at this Church's location, I'm Popeye's 4 LIFE!"
5,"My wife introduced me to Perkins just this year and every time we've driven through 
Wisconsin, we've stopped at a Perkins. This was the 3rd Perkins that I've been to and have enjoyed the food and service every time.

We both ordered pancakes with a side of bacon. The food was very good and the service was even better.

My wife commented that either Perkins manages to hire the friendliest people or they have excellent training."
5,"My favorite Thai place!   I rarely eat meat/picky with meat I eat  but the chicken here is always perfect! So delicious, friendly staff and great location!"
5,"I bought a spaghetti dinner and it was really good food. Hot, tasted good, and decent sized serving for the price. I liked that I got my food quickly and the staff was friendly. There is a drive-thru."
1,"If you could imagine what a restaurant would look like if you gave someone acid and told them to do some interior decorating, I am pretty sure this would be the outcome.  The outside includes statues of geese, hippos, buffalo's,  and assortment of other creatures.  The inside is wall to wall with stuff from Humpty Dumpty to an American flag to totem pole.   If only the food compared with this quirky atmosphere...

Long Wong's gets one star because the FOOD WAS AWFUL.  I ordered boneless chicken wings.  They were so hard and inedible that I broke my plastic fork trying to stab one to pick it up.  I am not talking a little freezer burn here but am talking hard as a rock.  The medium buffalo wing sauce was hot but had no flavor.  I also had a hot dog.  The bun was super stale and fell apart as I tried to eat the hot dog.  

The Costco style tables were filthy.  My child's high chair table is cleaner after she eats than the table we sat at.

If you bring your own food and table, you can enjoy the atmosphere. Otherwise, I highly don't recommend."
1,"Booked an appointment at Northlight Counseling a month ago, had my husband take the kids to preschool, arranged to be late to work, and navigated crazy Phoenix traffic for 60 minutes during rush hour only to have them tell me they made a mistake and didn't have me on their schedule. Now they can't get me in for another month! Ugh! I don't think I will be going back. They did apologize, but I will not risk having this happen again.  It's too bad because I had heard good things about Dr. Hicks."
1,Worst DJ is here. Way too loud on the microphone. I will not be going here.
5,"If you want to get your hair cut on a Saturday, make sure you schedule ahead. Dick & Arnie's Barber Shop (DABS) is always booked solid on Saturdays.

So, I'm really picky when it comes to haircuts. I like scissor or straight-edge cuts (not trimmer cuts), and I prefer to have a guy cut my hair since (no offense, women!). I've been going to $30-$45 per cut salons in several cities for the last 8 or so years, but when I moved to the Madison area, I was having trouble finding one that seemed like it would satisfy my two requests. Then, I read the Yelp reviews about DABS, especially noticing all the great stuff written about Ka. Since it's only a few quick minutes away from my house, with cuts only costing $16, I figured I'd give it a try, and - WOW! I am a loyal customer.

Ka gives fantastic haircuts -- the wife approves EVERY time I come home -- and, especially for the price, this guy just can't be beat. As a person, Ka is considerate and focused (he has a wife and 4 kids in addition to his job at DABS), and it absolutely shows in the haircuts he gives. 

Last thing: Lisa, one of the barber/stylists at DABS, decorates the place for almost every holiday throughout the year: St. Patrick's Day, Valentine's Day, Christmas, Fourth of July. Every time I go in, it's festive fun."
5,"The Thai food here is relatively Americanized, but hey, it tastes great regardless. The portions are large and they offer a wide variety of dishes. One unique feature to Wild Thaiger is that in addition to being a Thai restaurant, it's a Thai bar as well. They offer many Asian beers and Indochina-themed cocktails. They have seating indoors and out with a patio view of Central Avenue. The restaurant can be a bit easy to miss, especially for those used to Phoenix' usual parking-in-front cityscape, as it is in an older part of the city with the parking lot through an alley, behind the building. The food is delicious and the drinks are really good."
5,"I had a gift certificate for a free meal for two here and finally got around to using it right before it expired, and I'm sure glad I did! I didn't have very high expectations to be honest. And when we walked in we were the only ones there except for an elderly business man on his laptop...not a good sign I thought (even for a downtown restaurant in a downtown that clears out after business hours during the week). 

Anyway, everything we had to eat was delicious. We got the chicken tenders for an appetizer and it was very good quality meat, and not too greasy. The girlfriend got the chili, which was really good in no small part due to the fact that the meat used is brisket. Genius. I had the steak and rib combo. Steak was cooked to order and tasty. But the ribs are where it's at. Tender baby back ribs with thick, sweet bbq sauce. The meal also came with 2 rolls, mashed potatoes, and steamed veggies. You're not going home hungry that's for sure.

And the service was excellent. Granted, we were the only ones there. But still, our waiter went above and beyond and was so nice. I was worried he would mail it in when I showed our gift certificate but not at all."
1,DISGUSTING !! I had lunch there yesterday. Half way through there was a hair in my sub. It looked like a pubic hair. I took up to the manager and he offered to make me a new one. Since he was the one who made it in the first place I respectfully declined. How about you guys where hair nets or beard nets. I will not go back to this place again.
1,"Worst pho I have ever had!! Rubbery beef, crunchy noodles and tasteless broth.... Look else where for Pho!!!"
1,"It had been awhile since I'd been to a Lone Star and I really had no memories of the experience, so a few friends and I decided to try it out as it was the nearest steakhouse to our location.

We were extremely disappointed. Although the service was just fine and the bread & cheese fries were tasty, the rest of the food was either wholly unremarkable or completely unsatisfactory.

I ordered the 8 oz. sirloin (so cold and purple throughout that it could walk off the plate on its own; I know, go ahead and make a face...), with sautéed mushrooms and a house salad (no onions, extra ranch dressing) as my sides.

The salad was very plain and had nothing about it to distinguish it from any other salad anywhere (including one you would make at home or one that you would get from any buffet salad bar anywhere in the nation). I did not expect the salad to be the highlight of the meal, but usually there is something (a spiced up ranch dressing, flavored croutons, etc) that add to uniqueness of a 'house' salad. Not this time. Meh.

When my entrée showed up, the steak was warm, light pink throughout, rubbery, and absolutely flavorless. No rub, no marinade, and the cut had clearly either been recently frozen or sitting in a fridge for an extended period of time because the flavor of oxidation was rife. Please note that I never expect there to be marinades or rubs on a steak, but then I do expect the cut to stand up on its own (which it did not in this case).

The sautéed mushrooms were particularly disappointing. I love sautéed mushrooms. Adore them. I require nothing more than a little butter or oil on them and then just go to town in that pan! The mushrooms I received were a mix of mushrooms that had been sautéed to the point of shriveled brown lumps and those that had been held over a warm microwave for 15 seconds. On top of this odd culinary spectrum, there seemed to be nothing but water on them, which didn't do anything to assist in the flavor. A quarter through the meal, I'd had enough and claimed a full tummy (a white lie... forgive me).

Although the server was kind and competent, the food was a severe let down and I would never return to this or any other location. Sorry, Lone Star."
1,"I read the older reviews that thought it was way overpriced at $18.  Well now it is up to $30 and still way overpriced.  Went during the day and lots of animals were hiding in the shade as we should have been.  Didn't see much!!!  My advice is to go at night to see all the lights and not the animals, maybe then it would be worth the $30.  Go to the NC zoo, now that's a 5 star and much less than $30."
1,"Went there an hour ago to purchase a battery for my boss' vehicle, my boss paid cash for it and waited for the change from the employee there, but nothing happened because the employee doesn't want to give the change back to my boss.

If you do go there, DO NOT purchase anything from Veronica.  She's the most dishonest employee ever.  She acted all sweet and nice in the beginning, but later she lied about it.

Be wise about it, go shop somewhere else for better services."
5,"We were very impressed. I've never seen so many Dr's. taking care of one patient.  Although my husband had a lot going on, it still amazed us.  The care was excellent. The nursing staff was above reproach and took care of every need my husband had and even mine. They set it up so I could sleep right next to my husband in a somewhat cozy recliner with blankets & pillows.  It was clean and sanitary.  We've never had such attentiveness and compassion as my husband did at Good Sam."
5,"I showed up to this little place today with my co-worker. I was wearing business clothes, pressed wool pants' long sleeve shirt etc. I did not fit in or match the decor, but that did not matter. 

I read over the menu atop their cast concrete counter full of fun inclusions like a fork. Surprisingly there were several vegetarian options. Even the soup of the day was meat free. 

I had ""The Fin"" it was a tuna wrap, but not canned tuna, cooked tuna full of marinated flavor, accompanying it was a mango salsa, purple cabbage slaw and garlic white rice in a red tortilla. I opted for the jalapeno cabbage soup of the day as my included side. For $7.25 

The tuna was great despite looking over cooked, the soup was truly great. I do not like soup but I liked this soup, it was creamy without cream and had a great spice note. 

The service was fast and friendly. Moreover, our food came in a neat little bread loaf tin. 

There is a small patio both front and back and indoor tables and high tops. Parking is a bit tight. 

This is what a lunch place should be. I will be returning"
5,"They're the oldest, largest and most effective youth mentoring organization in the United States. Research has shown that positive relationships between ""Littles"" and their ""Bigs"" have a direct and measurable impact on children's lives. They are more confident in school, better able to get along with their families and peers, and less likely to begin using alcohol and drugs.

One of the reasons this program works so well is the dedication of the matchmakers. Their extensive interview and screening process ensures the best matches possible, which are based on similar backgrounds, interests and hobbies. 

What I've discovered during my time as a Big is that I get as much out of our relationship as my Little. He's an awesome kid that just needs a male role model in his life, and I am proud to be the one to be able to provide it. We've bowled, gone to the Arizona Science Center, the planetarium, watched movies, sometimes we just hang out and play video games.

The commitment they ask for is just a few hours two to four times a month, for a minimum of 6 months. Of course the longer the better - many matches remain friends for life.

Ok, now I'm going to wrap up by quoting Whitney Houston in a Yelp review (which a fellow Yelper bet me a Cornish Pasty I'd never be able to find a justifiable reason for doing so)... ""I believe the children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way. Show them all the beauty they possess inside."" Ha! I'll take that Eggplant Parmesan Pasty now, thanks."
1,"Remember when Burger King was actually somewhat decent?  Pepperidge Farm remembers...

I have dined with the King many a time across this fine land.  I have watched their slow decline with sadness over the last thirty years.  At one point, they actually challenged the Clown for burger superiority, but now, they're a weak shadow on the market, barely a player...

...and the BK at this location is a perfect example of why.

EVERYTHING at this BK takes ten minutes.  Doesn't matter what you order, be prepared to wait.

It's always dirty.  When I was a kid and worked at the Clown, we were always cleaning.  There was usually one or two people on any shift whose sole job was to keep the lobby clean.  This place is a hole.

Why does the food taste weird?  If I want BK, I actually make the drive to Deforest, rather than eat at this location, which is actually a stone's throw from my house.  The food here tastes bad, bleachy, and wrong.  What are they doing to the food?

Fix thyself, King, and maybe I'll return.  Until then, I will take my cheap, poorly constructed eats elsewhere."
5,"I know this place got a few nasty reviews, but I think they probably went in for the lunch, which unfortunately isn't as awesome as their dinner. The dinner is consistently delicious, the egg rolls are obviously made there and not frozen. Last time we went there we got the cashew chicken (amazing) and the sweet and sour chicken (pretty good) along with egg drop soup which is great too. They don't use msg, and one of the waitresses even took the time to talk to us for a while, they're always pretty nice. It may look like a hole in the wall, but those seem to be the best places to get a good plate of Chinese food."
5,"I started to give a ""4"" but thought about it - I've never had a bad experience at Los Olivos.  Maybe a small patch that they missed in the after-wash wipe down by hand, with water spots on the bumper some time back, but rare, and that's with the cheap wash.  I've not purchased their higher end car wash services and have always been quite satisfied with the cleanliness of my car inside and out though I usually go the cheapest route - and on my old car, a 77 Benz, they've never damaged my windshield wipers as has Clean Freak's mechanical beast. I've also never felt they were pushy when offering upgraded or additional services. Windshield repair: Quick. Indiscernible after repair. No out of pocket cost -billed my insuror.  Buffed out a bad scrape on friend's car I took in: Radical improvement in appearance: $10.  There is a big difference in the after wash wipe down by hand and it's definitely a positive difference."
5,"Beautiful Historic Home from the inside and out!  Their Tuna Salad Is by far the best Tuna I've ever had.  Elegant with their white tablecloths and impressive decor, yet jeans are very appropriate.  Cant wait to go back when its raining to sit by a window!"
1,"Worst Mexican food chain ever! The places are clean and nice, but the food is so generic and overpriced its not funny! If you think this is Mexiacn food, you'd be better off dining at Taco Bell and saving some $$! I can't stand this/these places... Been to them in Fresno, San Francisco, and now here in PHX, and they are all the same... BORING FOOD."
1,"Craving a thin crust Pizza Hut pizza last night I called this place at 8PM for a delivery..They were out of pizza,yes out of thin crust pizza...I said that's like McDonalds being out of cheeseburgers,and was hung up on!? Unbelievable!"
1,"It takes a lot for me to write a review and blast a company like this and to be fair, all the negatives come from their Gilbert location; the auwatukee location has always been good.  I've tried Ariba's several times and have been disappointed every time.  In the four of the last five visits, I've found the floors sticky and the tables dirty.  If they pay this little attention to the cleanliness of the front, I'm scared of what I might find in the kitchen.  Although I've always found the service to be slow and the waiters inattentive, Sunday's (8/5/12) experience was one of the worst I've ever experienced anywhere.  I thought I would take some out of town relatives to a good AZ Mexican dinner, but once we received our water/Ice tea, they were refilled once during our visit and that only after flagging down the waiter.  Minor, maybe, but when the food was delivered to the table, one of the meals was missing and I was assured it would be right out.  20 minutes later I flagged down the waiter once again and with apologizes, was told they would get it right out.  Another 20 minutes went by and my guests had all finished their meals before the waiter came by to see if we needed anything else. When I told him we still hadn't received the meal and since everyone else was done, we no longer wanted the meal and wanted it removed from our bill.  Again with apologies, he left and finally returned 20 minutes later with the meal removed.  Annoyed with the slow service I tried to return the bill with my credit card immediately.  I was ignored and waited another 20 minutes for him to return to take my money.  Save yourself a lot of aggravation and disappointment and go somewhere else."
5,"The Science Center provided a day of fun for my family. We ranged in age from 4-65 and all of us had a blast. If it hadn't been so chilly we would have played outside a lot longer. The Lego transportation room provided quite the challenge for all of us. Of course, there is nothing like stepping inside a gurgling stomach. The facility had several school tours during our visit, but it is large enough that we didn't feel crowded. Get there early and be prepared to have a good time!"
1,"My love affair with Fate ended when Johnny left. 

The service, quality and atmosphere took a total nose dive.

Go to Sens instead."
5,"Today's review is for the floral shop at Metcalfe's - I worked with Sally Rossmiller for flowers for my wedding, and she absolutely outdid herself with the arrangements she created!  I had a very specific look I wanted, and she was able to take the cute Pinterest photos I provided as inspiration and create truly spectacular arrangements using the elements I loved.  She worked hard to figure out which local flowers would be available at the time, and as a result we only had to have a few things that were sourced regionally instead of locally - very cool!! 

The flowers were all beautifully packaged and well labeled, as well, which made it easy for the folks setting up the morning of. Sally also had some great ideas that contributed to our day, as I probably wouldn't have gone hunting for vintage lace for my bouquet handle without prompting.  It made a lovely addition.  I can't recommend her work more highly, and I am so happy with the addition they made to our special day."
5,"I've been to the phoenix symphony a handful of times now and I always leave wanting to go back. There are no bad seats in the hall.The staff is completely professional and generally very friendly. 

Here's a couple of tips if you want to go. 
1) Bring cash for parking. I'm not even sure where you would go if you didn't have any cash to park. It'll cost roughly $12 to park in any of the nearby structures. 
2) Keep an eye out for discounted tickets.  the 2013-2014 season has been exceptional in regards to special offering for tickets.  This is probably because of their lack of real musical direction while they search for a new Music Director/Conductor.
Try the symphony's website or living social for deals.
3) Take a coat. It can be cold in the hall. If you're a guy, you should especially bring one for your girlfriend who will inevitably get cold and take it."
1,"Eek!  Me thinks not is the truth!  HORRIBLE with a CAPITAL HORRIBLE!  About 3-4 weeks ago I took in a 20x20 poster to be framed.  The guy told me it would be ready 9/19.  Notice that It's 3 days later than 9/19 and I have not yet received a call from them telling me my frame STILL isn't ready, but I have also called multiple times since Monday and I sit on hold for 10-20 minutes only to find out they still haven't done my frame.  If you quote a date, it needs to be available to be picked up that day or before in my opinion.  After speaking to the manager just now, he says they have ""125 customers that they deal with weekly in the framing dept.""  uh-huh.  That's NOT that many customers for a big name store and if they can't get their s*** together by the day they say they will, then they better back it up with a phone call or in the future recommend a later day that the item should be finished and ready for pickup.  Total crap. Two thumbs DOWN, wayyyy DOWN."
1,"This would be the ideal stop if you were on a scavenger hunt because any and all pop culture trash has been stuck on the wall, shelf or is hanging from the ceiling or parked outside.  OMG, hoarder heaven.
The food was okay yet i ate very skeptically half expecting a cockroach to climb onto the table.  I actually liked the hamburger.  There were wings too but i'm not a fan of those - soaked in enough sauce i'll eat though. There are skinny carrot sticks with thin and runny buttermilk dressing for dip on the side of each wing order.  There were families at the next table with a whiny child and dad yelling at her for most of our meal - how annoying was that.
It appeared there was only one restroom for everyone and we chose not to go there to wash our hands of all the wing grease and sauce."
5,"We LOVE this place. Food is excellent, service fast, huge portions, reasonable prices. Egg drop soup, spring rolls, bourbon chicken with veg fried rice--fantastic. You will not be sorry you visited. On nice evenings or lunches, eat outside ."
1,Called a cab about an hour ago and was told 10-20 minutes.  20 minutes ago was told 17 minutes.  Using my cell phone's last remaining battery life to leave this 1 star review.
5,"Shut your mouth!  Meatloaf of the Gods!  There are three types of meat rolled into this meatloaf.  It comes with a red wine gravy, mashed potatoes and veggies.  All of this for $10.  Yup, a complete, well-rounded, mouth watering meal for just $10.  

The broccoli was blanched rather than steam.  So it was not mushy.  

The service is incredible.  The people are friendly and the food comes up fast.  I have nothing but good things to say.  On a date?  With family?  Have a small child?  Check this place out.  

They get desserts from a local bakery.  The carrot cake is ridiculous.  Are you full from your meal?  Take cake or pie to go.  Seriously, you will not regret a snack for later."
1,"I've decided to try this place since I've been going to Arai Pastry in Tempe for a while and wanted to try something new.  There were many selections but honestly, I'm gonna stick with Arai Pastry from now on...here is why:

*First of all, this is not a Japanese bakery - I'm making this clear because even though there are similarities, Japanese and Chinese baked goods are most of the time, different.  

*Less than so so decor - It is understood that the decor of the store has nothing to do with the quality of the baked goods.  However,  since I already know a place that is much cleaner, cuter and with polite service, I can't help but to see it as a negative.

*So so service - There were no labels on each pastry trays so I asked the store lady to tell me what was inside some of them.  All I saw was annoyance from her....maybe she was just in bad mood....I have no idea.

*I tried the following:
-French horn - if you want a good one, please try the one at Lee's Sandwich
-Custard cream bread - honestly, after a bite, we had to through it away...if you like custard cream bread, try the one at Arai Pastry"
5,I've flown in here 4 times on some dinner trips from Chicago.  Some of the best service I have ever gotten from an FBO and the facility is quite nice.  This is one of my favorite places to go for a 100 dollar hamburger run.
5,"Smoky Jon's rack o' ribs puts all other rib places, and places that serve ribs to shame.  The portions are ginormous and the meat is tender.  The sauce that's slathered everywhere is spicy, tangy, sweet but not disgustingly so, and smokey.  

It reminds me of sitting around a campfire roasting some damn fine meat, slathering it up in top notch BBQ sauce and then grubbin' happily. 

For sides we had baked beans, garlic mashed potatoes and dinner rolls.  However after stuffing ourselves with tons of ribs there was no room for the sides! 

We ordered out because the dining area in Smoky Jon's is teeny tiny and the parking lot is even worse.  

Truly, my only complaint was that I spent all night in the bathroom after eating here.  I think that's because my system was just not prepared for the rich, smokey, deliciousness that I have never experienced before.

So it was worth it!  YAY!!!"
5,"AH-MAZING!

If you haven't been to Crave and work downtown near the Arizona Center, then you are truly missing a diamond in the rough!  With so many eating choices downtown, Crave really stands out as a place where quality and price are a top priority.  All their sandwiches are fantastics.  They even offer healthier choices with 1/2 sandwich and a salad or soup combination.  Their low prices make them the perfect choice for my daily lunch destination (Less than $7 and includes chips).

Their staff are very helpful and provide consistent service on a daily basis.  Be sure to get in early on your lunch break as it can get quite crowded.

Definately A+++!"
1,"I gave all smiles rave reviews initially but since then have had a horrible experience there.  First, they screwed up in scheduling my cleanings and much to my surprise, billed me $82.  What?  My cleanings are free!  If that is not so bad, I guess I'm just livid that I received a threatening letter in the mail saying that I had been disregarding my bills for months now and would have to pay in full.  IT WAS THE FIRST SUCH BILL I HAD RECEIVED! When I called the office they said they do the ""best they can"" in scheduling appointments so that the insurance covers it but there are over 1100 insurance companies and they are ""not perfect"".  Funny, I have been going to the dentist for years and have NEVER had to pay for a cleaning!  And for the nasty billing letter threatening to turn me over to collections ...  I MUST have received the other bills because they show they mailed them!   This place has gotten roughly $2000 from me in 1 year and $850 (+$82 now) out of my own pocket.  All Smiles, this is some ""thank you for your business"".  I will never be back!  BEWARE!"
1,I totally dislike this candy store to begaig with i went to this place 5 minutes before they close and the open sign wasn on.  They said its close come back tomorrow at 9am I went next day at 9am but it was still close never open waited there for 30 minutes and  I went to another candy store the name is Mayra's the lady was very helpful and nice!!!!!!! and thanks for letting me express my self......
5,"I have drove past this place a thousand times, and never realized it was even here.  I didn't discover my deep and passionate love of Nepalese food until moving up to the Twin Cities, but over break my dearest mother suggested we go to the Maharaja on the east side.

""On the east side?"" I scoffed, foolishly.  ""There is nothing but chain food and malls on the east side!""  I know this statement fairly well, as we grew up 20 minutes east of the east side of Madison, making a trip downtown quite a hike.

But she assured me that it was in fact  on the east side.  And not on the east side like....Ella's Deli is on the east side.  This thing is on the East Side as in East Towne Mall is on the East Side.

So, reluctantly, I went in.  AND WAS GREETED WITH AWESOME.  This buffet was amazing.  They had a coconut soup which was great, all of the chicken dishes were great, they had a wide variety of veg dishes...I was so stunned and amazed.  Even though I didn't partake, they served strawberry lassi...mmm!  Finished off with some mango ice cream, I couldn't have been more impressed.

Whenever I visit home, I always drag my family along to Maharaja.  Delicious, and a good price.  All the staff are very friendly too!!"
5,"Thata boy, That's A Wrap...you know what you're doing. I like sandwiches. I do. And I think I'm pretty good at judging a sandwich not only by its cover but by the options for what's inside too. Ladies and gentlemen, this shop has got it going on. If you've ever driven on 7th, you've probably passed it. Does the parking lot look intimidating? It is. But, if you can snag yourself a spot, you're in for a treat. Fresh tortillas, deli-style meat, farmer's market veggies, condiments galore and every wrap combo you can imagine. For the volume of customers, the service is great. There might have been a line out the door during lunchtime, but I got my sandwich in under ten minutes. Not bad. The wraps aren't too big and aren't too small. They're just right. And healthy too. 

After such successful experiences, I've decided I need to continue coming up with excuses to find my way to Downtown Phoenix. It's hard to find a good sandwich spot and when I do, it's lust and love at first site. So beware That's A Wrap, you've made a crush out of me."
5,"As far as wine and cheese bars go - this place has Postino's beat by a long shot.  The wine list is impressive.  The staff can make recommendations on the fly.  The owner actually takes his staff to visit vinyards so they become familiar with the wines.  The food is out of this world - but unpretentious.   You don't have to travel to Scottsdale to get fine food and drink -- we've got it right here in Central Phoenix at Cheuvront.   With that said - try the Macaroni and Cheese - which is what I tried tonight - out of this world, albeit a little spicy.  I've eaten there three times and have yet to try a desert because I'm so stuffed from the fabulous cheese selection and wine.  My new favorite!"
1,"Been to the Majerle's in Phoenix, but this review is for the new place in Chandler - as I can't remember the last time I visited the downtown estab.  The bottom line.  Avoid like the plague.  A couple observations:
- The place was total sausage fest.  Like 20 dudes to one girl.  During happy hour.
- Worst fish and chips imaginable.  Now what place on earth serves up cookie-encrusted grease-soaked cod with sugar-laced french fries???  Yuck.
- The tartar sauce to go with that?  Nope.  Just all mayo.
- Hot wings, surprisingly, we're okay.
- Philly cheesesteak sandwich - ick.
- Cole slaw, more like sugar slaw.

Place blows.  So many other great places in the East Valley to visit with your hard earned dollar.  Vote elsewhere."
1,"Absolutely THE worst!  This place won ""Best of Madison"" for Chinese food for how many years??? The judge must have been completely stoned out of his mind! 
Customer service:  Very poor.  The server never checked back until I went looking for her, wondering where our order was 50 minutes after ordering. 
Food finally arrived for our group of four--STONE COLD!  Plates themselves were hot but practically frostbite on the food.  Couldn't eat it. 
Manager came by, apologized and took 50% off the bill (!!!). Should have been 100% comped. 
I'm one of those folks who normally overlooks a lot and actually hates to complain, but this culinary travesty really needed to be reported.  If this place previously had great food and service, then as of 2014 they've completely lost their ""mojo""."
5,"I really like this place, great customer service and really nice restaurant, go in through the back!"
5,"I started going to Los Olivos for car washes years ago bc they're a sponsor of the Mercury (the WNBA team), and I have been very impressed with their quality of service. Coletta is such a friendly face to see, and the fact she always recognizes me means a lot."
5,"OK OK... as a Proud Italian I hope my momma don't see this! I'm actually going to give D'moes a 5 star rating for a few reasons. Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few ""adult"" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was D'moes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying ""who ordered pizza"" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesome'ness that is called ""their customer service"" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm.... Potential there...."
5,"My table ordered: and I sampled it all.

- chicken pot pie with mashed potatoes
(fantastic, but a bit heavy on the rosemary)

- BLT with red fried potatoes
(came with Guacamole. Nice surprise and flavor)

- Chicken soup with side salad
(good homemade taste & look)

- Blueberry Pancakes with bacon
(Fluffy, moist, loads of berries, crisp bacon)

- French toast with sausage
(great cinamon sugar, smaller portion, tasty sausage)"
5,"I love that this place is nearly unrecognizable from the street. And that you don't hear a word of english being spoken. You know you're in for good food at that point. 

I had papusas and a random sampler - and my favorite fried plantain with beans and sour cream. 

This was good - better than Eliana's yes - but both are pretty damn good. And i felt like this place was Phoenix - super seedy exterior, lots of espanol, and good food in a strip mall - Phoenix to a tee."
1,"This place is the dive bar of grocery stores. Congrats Fry's! You popped my 1-star cherry.

It is only due to my current boycott of Target that I brought my business to the Fry's next door. This decision was based on principal, but I have to say I have missed Target.  

When I walk through the front doors I just feel miserable. The 'energy-saving' automatic lights make me seize. The narrow aisles make me claustrophobic. The overall dinginess consumes me. I'm suddenly overwhelmed with an anxious feeling similar to when I brought a bad report card back to my parents. Or when I had to confront an ex-gf's parents about why the Pennsylvania State Troopers were calling them at 4am. 

My pace quickens. My pupils dilate. The lump in my throat expands. I try to gasp for air, but the weight on my chest suffocates me. I feel lethal; on the verge of frenzy. My mask of sanity is about to slip. Sweat beads down my back. My aggressiveness becomes visible. The curmudgeon at the self-checkout grunts at me. Darkness comes over me...

I reemerge 36 hours later with no semblance of reality. Fry's is a catalyst of my psychosis."
1,"there should be a negative rating on here.  one star is way to high.
i am sick and tired of how the cable box is never working their solution? KEEP RESETTING THE BOX... YES IT IS MY JOB TO MAKE SURE I GET MY SERIVCE ON A DAILY BASIS.  IT'S NOT THEIRS TO MAKE SURE IT WORK.  Plus they have poor customer service but I don't blame the people that answer the phones but the people who st the rules to nickel and dime it's customers. 

charter is horrible and since i coudn't get thru to complain on the phone here is my truth.  Charter is the worst."
5,I live across the street and visit often. Could not ask for a better atmosphere with a view of the inside of Chase Field! The customer service has always been great. Often times it get dinner to go and the bartenders are friendly and chat it up while I wait. Just the traditional Fridays menu but the location makes it worth going. Definite place to check out when you are downtown. Doesn't have to be a game day.
1,"CVS is pretty standard, right? Pharmacy, overpriced beauty section (but you sure avoid going to Ulta if you can find what you're looking for there), great sales--on booze, on food, stationery, games--whatever. When I lived across the street, I used to come here at night when I was bored and it wasn't busy. Now, though, there are new employees and unfair practices. On more than one occasion, the employees have held sale items for themselves behind the counter. Today, there were no Connect Four on the shelf, but there was one in the cart behind the counter. When the manager was asked about it, she shrugged and pointed at another employee. I've worked in retail before, and this goes against most store policies. 

So, the next time you get a CVS flyer, remember that if it's okay for the employees to shop the sales for themselves here--then it might be happening all over the place. And if they can put one item behind the counter for themselves, then they can put a lot more for their friends. Prepare to be disappointed. Make the extra trip and hit up Wal-Mart."
1,the chicken wings gave me food poisoning.  will avoid in the future.
5,"Love the sauce, corn, fries, everything I've tried!"
1,"So we finally ate here. The decor has not been updated since about 1967, and we were surrounded by overweight senior citizens reeking of cigarette smoke. The food was reminiscent of middle school cafeteria fare. 

The waitresses were very friendly, and the prices were not bad. We were obviously not the target demographic, though. Won't be back. Too bad, because we can walk there..."
1,"Whenever I check out a new place, be it a restaurant, store, or service provider, I always sort the yelp reviews by date, with the most recent first.  Good reviews from 3 years ago are not as helpful as good reviews from 3 weeks ago.  Ditto for bad reviews.

If you sort the reviews for this shop by date, you'll see the 3 most recent reviews below this one are all 1 star, and all for similar reasons: customer service, or lack thereof.  This review is no different.

I am currently in the market for a new mountain bike.  I've done my research, talked to friends who are bike enthusiasts, and I've looked around a few places.  Really, all I needed from Slippery Pig was to get my frame size double checked, and to answer a few questions about some subtle differences between different equipment setups between Cannondale models.  If they had provided those answers, they would have made a sale.

In the past 4 weeks, I stopped by the shop 3 times.  All 3 times, my entry, browsing, and lingering presence went unnoticed.  I was ignored when the shop was somewhat busy (acceptable), but also when there was only one other customer.

I understand that the guys can get busy, or can be distracted, etc.  But how hard is it to get a simple acknowledgment or something like ""Hey, we'll be with you as soon as we can""?  I've gotten more acknowledgment of my presence from strangers in a stadium men's room waiting line than I did from the staff at Slippery Pig.  How hard is it to at least give me a head nod, or even look in my direction?  Actually, I take that back.... I watched them all look at me, but then not say anything.  I even got acknowledged by another customer as I fiddled with price tags, but nothing from the sales guy standing between us both.  Unbelievable.

Well, needless to say, I will not be spending my hard-earned money there.  I wish I could opine like other yelpers about their aloof attitudes, or their knowledgeability, or service.  Sadly, I can't because Slippery Pig never had me at hello.

Ignore me once, shame on you.  Ignore me twice, shame on me.  Ignore me three times, get 1 star on yelp."
5,"We discovered this place when my 4 year old gave herself a haircut and she needed some additional help.  It happens to be conveniently located down the street from us and was recommended by a friend.  Turned out to be a good experience.  They are very friendly, good with kids, and reasonably priced.  Now the whole family goes!"
5,"So this review is probably a little biased (cuz shopping here reminds me of the awesome time i lived in Oaxaca, Mexico), but still; teee-rust me, Ranch Market is full of life and great produce and makes grocery shopping just a lil more fun:) 
I usually make sure I go on Wednesdays where produce is ridiculously cheap...like 7 kiwi's for a dollar or 9lbs for a dollar watermelon...I'm not gonna lie, I have posted my receipts on the fridge with pride...these are my ""A"" graded school papers of adulthood. The only issue is that when I come home with a trunk full of fresh fruit and veggies that cost me $8 I slowly realize I have to actually store and eventually eat all of the produce I just bought. I hear Thursdays are the days to buy meat for cheap--but my fridge is usually busting with pineapple and strawberries by that point and there isn't room for an ounce of carne asada. 
long story short, be prepared to weave through the masses on Wednesday mornings for some great finds. The rest of the market is fabulous as well. The ""Tradiciones"" restaurant serves excellent--and cheap (shocker) authentic Mexican food. Plus they also have an aisle with cooking supplies (like giant blue pots, tortilla presses, molinillos etc) and a whole wall of spices. 
enjoy:)"
5,"Metcalfe's, what is this? I am new to Madison and everyone can't stop talking about what an experience it is to shop here. It's the fine-dining of grocery shopping. Well, I have only been shopping like a grown up for about a year now - but I learned how to do it in Denver. So the bar was set pretty high through Whole Foods and Safeway. But I can safely say that my experience at Metcalfe's topped it.

It was very clean and well stocked. I believe I went on a Friday night too. The main goal was to get some fresh meat and milk; let's face it - those are two items you don't want to get from an Aldi's or a Woodman's. I was told by a friend that I was lucky to live so close to it, but to be careful because it was expensive. WRONG, not expensive (or maybe Denver was expensive, so that word has become relative).

Safeway had a discount meat section because it was within a few days of expiring (cook it that night and you're fine). Now, I wasn't looking for that at Metcalfe's (I don't know if they'd have that even), but I found $2 Pork Butt Steak (which, the mere name of the steak made me question it - but for $2 I'll try anything once). Delicious, and I won't go as far as to say I'm a great cook.

Of course I also got some stuffed pork chops and fresh produce. But the experience I had was very pleasant and the prices were fair for the quality of food I was buying (dare I say, I thought prices should be higher).

As for the atmosphere, I don't think I've gone to a store in a long time that played classical music. I almost feel like if I came in sweatpants and a t-shirt that I would be under-dressed to get groceries.

Whole Foods ain't got nothing on Metcalfe's (leave my double negative alone)."
1,"Groupon rip-off. Small salad, three extremely small plates of mediocre pasta desserts that cloyed the palate. All for an advertised value of $90. Will NEVER return."
5,"If you care about your car, you'll make the effort to head to Los Olivos Hand Car Wash. I'm pretty particular and careful about the care of my car. So much so, that in the past, unless I need it waxed or detailed, I usually washed and vacuumed myself. 

Now, I find myself still sneaking in for a little TLC at Los Olivos though, when I am too lazy to do it myself. The staff is super nice and very helpful with letting you know about what they offer and any specials without being pushy in any way. They even have a punch card and eventually you get a free wash. Pretty dandy eh? 

The waiting area isn't top notch, but it's a car wash people. It does have a small shop with sodas, snacks, gift cards, random misc car items and some chairs to sit and wait. Supposedly there's a shoe shiner, but I'm still waiting for the day we're there at the same time. Additionally, Giant Coffee is just a hop, skip and a jump away, and that's usually where I am while I wait.

I've been a loyal customer for awhile now, and this past weekend, realized it was time to get the interior of the car detailed again. They did a spectacular job which prompted my need to review. I ordered the mini detail which does a full job inside and a wash and buff/wax outside. The four hours was so worth it. They even offered to give me a ride home if I really needed, but I had prepared. My trusty laptop and I did some coworking over at Giant all afternoon. And when I was called that she was ready to do, I was in no way expecting to see my car look as new as she did over 5 years ago. I'm still in awe. Ever since, I've been showing her off, and it feels like I'm in a brand new car all over again. The paint is shiny and new, the inside was cleaned from top to bottom (even the ceilings) and the detail in the dashboard and console is incredible. I had already decided to never go anywhere else, but now I think I'll be getting it detailed much more often.

You will not be disappointed. I love this place."
5,"If you like light to medium roast coffee this is the place to be. I couldn't find better one on east side of Madison in last few years with the same consistency.
Always not too slow not too busy. You can hear another person if you are not alone. Never had a problem.
Had lunch once, if I remember correct it was on ok side. 
Plenty of free parking."
1,"if you like terrible service and overpriced food you've come to the right place.  If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, I would've stayed away (which is what you should do).  Food wasn't awful, although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a ""Rock"" bread on their sandwiches. The mac n' cheese was nothing special.  The service was beyond poor.  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe."
1,"I used to be a huge fan of this place until last night. I went in to find a nice dress to wear. After wandering the store looking for the plus size section (I proudly wear a size 18) and not finding anything, I asked the clerk where it was. Apparently they no longer carry anything over a size 16.
Talk about being disappointed. I was so upset I almost cried. 
Shame on you...... You should also put a sign up now so that girls like me don't waste our time wondering through your store anymore..."
1,"The west side location was way better. After they shut down I started going to this one. The food isn't as good and the fresh made tortillas are always either hard, cold, or burnt. Half the time I'm there they screw up my order. One time there was a miscommunication between the waitress and my boyfriend which ended up costing us $7. It wouldn't have been that big of a deal if the manager at first told the waitress to tell us she wasn't there and when she did finally come out she didn't apologize, make any effort into making the situation any better, and then started repeating the same thing over and over again so we'd shut up. A couple of my friends and I have decided to never go back here. Hopefully the west side one will open up again."
5,"We LOVE the AZ Science Center so much that we recently became members and plan to go often. We love the exhibits and the fact that they change out the special exhibits often. I do recommend packing a lunch as the cafe is a bit pricey, but the food is good."
5,"My friends and I agreed that this was the best gallery we saw on this particular First Friday in Phoenix. Located conveniently next to Modified Arts, an attractive low-ceiling space showcased some of the more ""advanced"", ""mature"", and ""developed"" art were the words we came up with. A smaller room, opened up to a much large space to the left and at the time there was a small installation in the backroom that was interactive and impressive. Definitely a sophisticated gallery in a fantastic location, highly recommended."
1,"Dirty.

So dirty.

Hair in the french fries dirty.

Cook sitting on the counter dirty.  

Undercoooked hamburger meat, and the server's fingers in my food dirty.

Flies on the lip of the water pitcher dirty.

Somehow these guys think that if you wear gloves you are spared from all contamination.  As if scratching your ass with your gloves on will keep the ass germs from getting in your food.  

I've been there before, and have tried to look past all these things, when eating such delicious food, but really, it's not worth it anymore."
1,"I arrived a bit earlier than their opening time of 11am (about 5minutes too soon), and figured I would wait until they opened because I needed a new flat iron. I peeked through the front window because the flat irons were on a display facing the window so I figured I'd window browse until they opened. At 11:03 the brunette ""manager"" (she was pretty young) started unlocking the doors for the employee who had just arrived, smoking a cigarette on her way in the door. Then the same manager opened up the gates on the windows and walked away. I tried to make eye contact with her because it appeared that the gate opening signalled they were open and I wanted the go-ahead to enter but she refused to look at me. So finally I just opened the door and asked ""are you open now?"" very politely. The manager snipped ""Yes, we don't open earlier than 11. Those are the hours!"" with a frown and a white-trash attitude. I said ""okay thats fine... I just wasn't sure if you were opening the gates because it was officially open or not.. wow."" 

Now, I know how irritating the ""waiting at the window"" customer can be so I tried my best not to be that person - but was not greeted, was treated rudely and received a nasty ""welcome"" by the angry-at-life manager.

Then the employee girl and manager started talking together about going out to clubs, about how they were 30 dollars short on the till the day before because they counted it too fast the night before because they wanted to ""get out of here and go out!"" and other inappropriate conversation. The employee did her best to be polite and helpful, but it was clear she had never been trained on proper customer service (probably because her manager is so awful).

I ended up buying the flat iron thanks to the help of the employee. At one point another customer tried to pay with a credit card, but the employee had to wait for the manager to get off the phone so she could use the dial-up to swipe the card. When the employee asked the manager to end the conversation so she could help the customer the manager yelled ""No just wait!"" from the back of the store. I was shocked!

Today is a Sunday so I don't know if this is the regular manager, but this relatively young brownhaired woman was like a bad joke. I won't be returning again, even if this styling iron fries up tomorrow! Not worth it!"
1,"Been meaning to try this place for years and finally had an opportunity. Unfortunately it was a huge let down. The first bad sign was that upon walking in every table table that wasn't occupied had not been cleared from the previous diners. During the 1 1/2 hrs (!!!) that we were here there were several tables that NEVER got cleared. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 45+ minutes until we received our food which was strange as no one else in the restaurant seemed to be ordering any food. There was a hair in the fish and chips (disgusting but mistakes happen), and the rest of the food was sub par at best. 

Having lived half my life in England  I've been to plenty of pubs and also eaten plenty of mediocre pub food (none to my recollection as tasteless as this). However I would imagine that if you're trying to emulate a British Pub across the pond you would only want to bring over the best of the best, not the worst of the worst. Even the sad little mini frozen sausage rolls I had as a child were better. I'm a bit horrified that this is the ""taste of England"" that is being imposed on unsuspecting Arizonians who don't know any better. 

I guess if you're just looking to knock back a pint or two and play pool and would only ever order food under the most drunk and dire of circumstances then you may enjoy this version of a pub. There certainly were a lot of regulars (not ordering food...). 

P.S. I don't know if that greasy little man was a busser or a patron. If he was a patron he had no business going into the kitchen as many times as he did, or eating on the floor. If he was a busser then it would have been nice to see him clear more than one table he did. And I most certainly hope it was not his stringy long hair that we found in the fish and chips, although I wouldn't be surprised."
5,Big thumbs up for this place. Great spot for burgers and dogs!
1,Went for a late night meal since Los Cerritos was closed. First time eating at the this location. The following day was filled with throwing up bial and not keeping anything down. Pins and needles in the hands and feet. Nausea and light headed. 90% sure I have food poisoning from this steak egg and cheese burrito with potatoes and beans. Never again.
1,"I'm not going to lie; I wanted to go to this Denny's solely because of Jetta R.'s review.

Bad, bad, bad.  Bad service, bad food, bad experience.  I took my friend here twice to make sure that the first time wasn't just a fluke.  Our waitress was a total space cadet and was completely uninterested in us.  I realize Denny's isn't a high class restaurant, but I do subscribe to the belief that your water glass should never be empty.  We put our glasses at the end of the table.  The waitress flitted around at the tables behind us (there were two, maybe three other tables occupied when we visited, tops), but didn't cater to our needs.  She treated us like children on both visits.  I told my friend, ""the tip meter is running.""

I wanted to like Jenny's, but it just sucked.  There's no reason for crappy service with a place as empty as it was."
1,"It had been quite a while since we ate at a Cracker Barrel. We stopped there when shopping at East Towne Mall. I ordered the pot roast and my husband ordered chicken and dumplilngs. Yuck! It had more salt than you'd find in food at McDonalds. The meat in the pot roast tasted processed. The dumplings were slimy. The vegetables were so salty, they were inedible. Pros: The shop is very cute. Cons: Don't eat the food."
1,Don't bother going here to watch the NFL unless you're a Packers fan.  Refused to turn up volume in a room full of Bears fans so we could actually hear the game.
5,"This is just a tiny restaurant with a real family feel. We came for a late breakfast on a Sunday. The waitstaff were quick to help us. We chose seats at the counter. There were many specials, breakfast, lunch, soups, biscuits and gravy, lots of diner food. We sat among the regulars and were treated like one of the family. The husband had eggs, hashbrowns and toast-all cooked to perfection. I had a pancake that was huge and so delicious-just like dessert for breakfast. The prices are reasonable, the food plentiful and the atmosphere is very friendly. Nothing fancy, just good food.We will be going back."
5,"The Blue Fin is a great little place and it truly needs our love. Due to the light rail biz for them has dropped a bit. 
I've never been disappointed with anything I have ordered. The gyoza is great, the beef curry and chicken curry bowls are huge, filling and delicious. 
I'm always looking for good ice tea and Blue Fin has it. 

The owners and staff are always friendly and very accomodating. 

This place is small and around lunch time can be packed. They do have a drive thru and if you call ahead all you have to do is pull up to the window and your food is waiting. The drive thru window as far as I know is only for call in orders you can't just pull up and order food.

My only complaint is they are not open on weekends."
5,"We love the Cash. It is one of the few bars that have a smoking patio that you can drink on.

We have donated a lot of stuff to raffle off for charity events at the Cash. They always have a great turnout.

The crowd is extremely diverse. The drinks are good and cheap, and the bar staff is very friendly."
5,"Just had an awesome ""eggwich"". Great service and a really cool vibe. Can't wait to come back to check out the patio in the evening for a drink."
5,"I know... it's Target, but it's got pretty much everything you need short of a butcher shop and babysitters. Staff is very helpful... it also houses the closest Starbucks to my home. Since we're talking about 2 miles, that's a bit sad, but oh well.."
1,"I really hate to do this, because I have been a fan of the Merc Bar for years, but its a must.  My fiance & I were looking for a place to entertain our wedding party the weekend before our wedding and it was clear to us that the Merc Bar would be the perfect place.  We love the atmpsphere.  It usually has a nice & mature crowd.  The service is usually good.  It was perfect.  

Unfortunately, it was the management and not the lounge that ruined our perspective of the venue.  The manager (Tommy) was slow/nearly impossible to reach and even harder to get info out of.....i.e. Whats your process for group reservations. 

He seemed annoyed that I conntact him and unwilling to make time for us.  After several incomplete emails he finally called me, at my request, but it became clear, after 5 mins on the phone, that he did not want our business.  It was also apparent that he lacked basic customer service skills.

Since, the goal of the evening is relax & enjoy our time with our friends, not to worry about bad service, we took our covo with Tommy as a hint that the Merc Bar would not be a good fit.  We need a place with a more mature management staff.....so, we're going with the Montelucia.  Its a nice upscale resort, with an awesome spa, a very nice lounge & live music on Saturday night, a great pool & nice rooms.   Truly perfect."
1,"I grew up eating in little hole in the wall chinese restaurants and I really wanted to like New Garden.  I had driven past the place many times and thought it was abandoned but after looking on Google and seeing some good reviews on Yelp I decided to give the place a try.

The interior matches the exterior,  There were food stains on the wall next to the both I was eating in.  The server laid out our place setting by handling the eating surface of every utensil she put down.  One of the bowls they brought us was dirty too.  

The server never came around to see if we needed anything else but she did decide to drop off more napkins right as we were finishing our meal.  The food isn't bad the prices don't match the service and the questionable cleanliness will make it enough for me to never come back."
1,I stopped by this bar because a friend knows the owner. The patrons were nice and the bar tender was fantastic. I gave it one star because the owner  (little dude) and his wife (drunk with an attitude) really don't care about their patrons. Not a good experience for non-locals and I would not suggest this bar.
5,When I only ordered sandwiches I was doing it all wrong. The way to go is to get a half chicken and the 1/3 slab combo with brisket. Insane amount of food? Yes. Worth getting to try all the best parts of the menu? Yes!
1,"I had my LASIK consultation today.  I waited in the waiting room for about 30 minutes prior to being taken back by the ""Director of the Center"".  She took me in a room and did a quick ""test"" on my eyes and then brought me to another room, sat me down and asked if I had any questions about the procedure.  I said I had numerous questions, but would prefer to speak to the surgeon (No need asking them twice, since I really only cared about what the surgeon had to say).  She said asking her my questions/concerns was ""one in the same"".  I think not.  That was the first red flag.  The second one came after she said I would not be meeting the surgeon at all prior to the day of surgery.  Who in their right mind agrees to an elective surgery without meeting the surgeon prior to the day of surgery?  I have never heard of such a thing!  I'm assuming after you pay in full you are then allowed to meet the surgeon.  The third and final red flag came after she said she would schedule me an appointment with the surgeon at another time and then revoked that offer, saying ""We just don't do that here.""   I got up and left.  This place is obviously a LASIK factory mill and I'm not willing to put my eyes at risk to save a few bucks. Beware."
1,"The worst. I drove by and didn't even stop. Hookers on the corner. Drug deals going down in the street, strip club across the street next to the burned out building....dont waist your time. Then Days Inn would even refund my money for two rooms. DAYS INN is the worse...."
5,"The Pad Thai Tofu with Vegetables was so delicious and generous in portion size. I am so glad my husband and I decided to eat here. After trying many other Thai restaurants in the area it's nice to find one that knows how to actually make the dish. Awesome food, terrific service and a overall wonderfully satisfying experience!"
5,Awesome!!! Great dish peanut chicken
5,"Green Chile chicken enchiladas, Oysters and with the right person... perfect."
5,Went for a quick lunch today and am so happy.  I have found a new spot to add to my best Mexican places in the valley.  I had the chilaquiles and WOW they were amazing.  So much flavor alone then I added the Habenero salsa and it was like a bomb going off spicing up the dish just right.  They also have the Pepsi in the bottle which I got for my beverage.  The rest of the menu looked amazing and they have $1 tacos for the value minded people.  Definitely check this place out you won't regret it.
5,"Toby's has one of the best fish fry's around which makes this place SUPER packed on Fridays.  Expect an hour wait as they do not take reservations. We have never had bad food here and we come here 2 - 3x/month. My husband loves the steaks. I usually order a variety of their seafood. We love the supper club effect with the veggies out first.  Salads are always fresh.  I recommend you try Toby's if you are not in a hurry.  They are just that good!  You will not be disappointed. Relax with one of their signature key lime martinis...better yet, make it two!!!"
1,would not suggest renting from this company they care nothing about the property itself only that you pay they leave all the responsibility to the onsite manager of their properties a good example of this is their location on n 27th st off of indian school called la villa managed by some pretty good liars beware
5,"Carl and his cakes are GREAT! We ordered a cake for our recent wedding in Madison. Carl was very easy to work with, and he took great notes during our tasting (not every wedding vendor we worked with was good about doing this). We got exactly what we wanted, and many of our guests complimented us on such a beautiful and delicious cake!! Price is also very reasonable"
1,"I have to say, wow how bad can you get.  Yes the building is pretty, but everything else is of the poorest quality.  The staff is inattentive, the food greatly over priced and poorer than fast food quality.  We ordered a ""Classic"" California roll and were very surprised that is was not in fact a California roll (enough lemon flavored mayo to choke a horse).  Our entrée which consisted of two salads took over half an hour to arrive, and seriously could have gotten larger fresher salads for half the price at Wendy's.  I ordered the Chicken Club salad, the mixed greens were wilted, the chicken sparse and mostly batter, two small cubes of avocado, and the bacon was leathery not crunchy.  My wifes salad had rotisserie chicken that was hastily pulled from the chicken and included connective tissue, fat and congealed blood.  While waiting for and eating our meal we observed two tables beside us have at least three employees stop by to chat for more than ten minutes at a time.  After our meal we sat and waited for 15 minutes for our server to come by with our check and then another 10 before we could flag down what looked like a manager to take our money.  It took another 10 minutes to get our change.  It was nice however to have the tip amounts printed on the receipt so that we knew what not to give.  I really liked Houston's the few times I was there, Hillstone I will not be returning to."
5,"Main Moon is hand's down my favorite place to grab Chinese in McFarland, but really anywhere. No matter what time of day, day of the week, or week of the year - it only takes 15 minutes to get your food. Freshly made each time too. Don't order from the pictures, order from you heart. The staff is so friendly, I'm thinking about proposing in the near future, as I hope to be a part of their family like they've been a part of mine. I just can't even talk about the lunch buffet, I'll start tearing up with how amazing the deal is. Andddd, I just shed a tear. Yum yum yum in my tum tum tum. Miss you, Main Moon xoxox"
1,"I was suprisingly displeased this time around. It was my 2nd time there and it wasn't anything like I remembered. The salad was DRENCHED in dressing (which I hate) so if you don't like that, get your dressing on the side. All I ordered was the soup and salad lunch special. They brought me my first salad which consisted of, literally, maybe 11 pieces of iceberg lettuce, 3 slivers of carrots, 4 slivers of cabbage, and about 8oz of dressing!! absolutely disappointing. I ordered my second salad with the dressing on the side and, of course, they brought me a REAL-SIZE salad the 2nd time. They should have done that the first time. The service was slow as hell and they brought us 2 loaves of bread (bc we had a party of 7) with only 1 knife. It was retarded all around. Just about everyone else was dissatisfied with their meals. It was lunch hour, I'll give them that....but they weren't even busy!!! Never going there again :("
1,The sushi here sucks!  Small portions and they are cheap with the rice bowl servings.  The owner is a real jerk and  can use some training on people skills.  The people who work here change as much as you do laundry!  I've seen the owner talk down to his employees like they're stupid.  So unprofessional. Don't order lunch special California roll.  You will feel silly paying that much money for a snack size sushi.  Based on the jerk owner I'd give this place a -1 but the chicken udon is actually good- so there is my 1 star.
1,Won't be back...these guys stole all my Change out of my console...generally you expect random coins in the cup holders to be taken...but they went into a closed console and stole an entire change holder...don't give these guys your business!!!
1,"I don't even know where to begin to point out all the sucks about Macayo's.. they have NO redeeming qualities about them. Greasy chips, tasteless watery salsa and horrible food!

We ate at this location twice and both times we ordered the mini chimi's which BOTH times came to the table frozen in the middle! Uhg! Most learn from their mistakes, not here.. they make the same mistakes and obviously don't care enough to try to make things right.  Both entree's were served to us at room temperature. Chicken Quesadailla and the Baja Enchilada. 

If you want to have decent Mexican food please, go somewhere else! For this style of food I think I would prefer Carlos O'briens."
5,This place was my very first Thai experience 5 years ago and it was delicious! We had one of the curries and it was the perfect balance of flavors. This place is what turned me on to Thai food being my favorite food. The restaurant itself is nice and their Thai iced tea was yummy. I wish the hours were better though.
5,"Came her with my wife and daughter on a whim. We saw a sticker in the back of a truck that said ""I love pupusas"" on our way to Applebees and my wife asked what those were. After telling her she set to finding a place we could get them.

This place came up with some of the best reviews so we made the trek across the valley to try them.

At first I was struck by the lack of people in the place but as we sat I got more comfortable. The staff made sure we were comfortable and all our needs met.

The food was delicious! I can't speak highly enough of it. 

You can't add a tip to your credit card receipt so bring cash."
1,"I had a whole review written and then IE crashed and I lost it but essentially, here's the gist:

Don't go to this joint. It used to be decent to good..more towards the good. Now you bring your car in dirty and it leaves dirtier after they've used dirty, damp towels to swish the dirt around.

Save your money,. I'm not sure where to go unfortunately because I can't seem to find ANY decent car wash in the valley anymore, but I can tell you not to bother with any of the Danny's car washes in the valley."
5,"Great experience.  Great ice cream.  Always a good alternative to the restaurant across the parking lot.

DQ rocks..."
5,"We have been frequenting here more often lately since it is by our favorite theater. 

Our bartender now recognizes us, knows our order, and is sweet as pie.

Seriously one of my favorite happy hour spots of all time."
5,"Great food, awesome customer service."
1,"Unless you like being ignored, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid! Stopped in for lunch today and the place was pretty much empty. There was a lady waiting at the counter for her order, two gentlemen who already had their order and were seated and eating. There was one worker for the front counter and the drive thru and 2 or 3 workers in the back. Waited over 10 minutes for someone to take my order and wasn't even acknowledged in that time. One of the guys came up front to bag drive thru orders, wiped the sweat off his face with a napkin, crumpled it up, tossed it in the trash and then scooped up fries without washing his hands. At that point I walked out and went to Culvers where I ordered and got my food in less time than I spent waiting to order here.  Not even worth one star!"
1,"I am disappointed in this place. I walked in one day to query about the price to just hem a wedding dress and was quoted $15. I was super excited since my budget for the wedding is almost nothing. So I got there and was ignored for the first 3 mins then the woman told me to go put on the dress. I did so and she had me stand on the rises, told me how she would bustle it and put one in in the hem and one at the bustle point and said ""that's it, you're done."" Really? That's it. She didn't let me give her  my input, she didn't pin it all the way around to ensure it was even, nothing. She didn't even listen when i told her I wanted some of the lace at the bottom removed. She also didn't look at the bodice to see if it fit well, it does but I think it could fit a bit better.  Being stressed and in a rush I bagged up the dress and gave it to the clerk who told me I could pick it up on Oct 8th (4 days before my wedding!) and it was only Sept 16? I was told on the phone the turn around time was 7 days. I was a bit distressed by this but left it with them anyway.  I left the store and realized they hadn't quoted me a price so I went back in. They wanted $150. I told them I was quoted $15 and I only paid $100 for the dress to begin with. They didn't say anything. I left and left the dress with them. I got home and pondered their poor treatment and apparent disregard for my desires for my gown so I called them and canceled the alteration. They hadn't done anything with it yet (THANK GOD). I picked it up the next day and will be either doing it myself or going elsewhere. For something as special as your wedding you need a tailor that puts YOU and your wishes first and doesn't rush you  in and out. GO ELSEWHERE!"
1,The food here is decent but certainly not worth dealing with the very condescending owner. I'd much rather take my money to a place that appreciates their customers.
5,"Mi Amigos is one of my favorite Mexican Food restaurants for two simple reasons. 1. I love the chips & salsa and 2. They have my all time favorite chile relleno.

The Chips & Salsa
Mi Amigos gives you some of the largest chips I've come across.  They are little half tortillas that are crisp and simple.  The salsa is heavy on the cilantro, but its chunky with good flavor.  I'm all about the big chunks of tomato in my salsa.

MY FAVORITE CHILE RELLENO
I've been ordering this big beast of a relleno stuffed full of chicken for years.  The chicken inside is simply grilled chicken and its covered in some gooey cheese.  The pepper is a little bit random in heat - sometimes I sweat like a B while shoveling away, and sometimes it's rather mild. The batter they cook it in is different than most rellenos, its sort of crumby and dark, but delicious.  The sauce is some simple looking orange sauce with some sour cream in it - sorry, I can't cook so my skills in ingredient identification suck - I just know it's delicious!  My favorite.  I order it every time I'm there.

I visit this Mi Amigos every time I'm in the area looking for food.  I can't remember the last Arizona Center place I ate at other than Mi Amigos.  I have to have the relleno any time I'm near."
1,"OMG! what the heck happened to this place? It hasn't even been more than a year since I was there last, and it has totally gone down the drain. the ladies restroom was worse than a truck stop restroom. I've driven coast to coast 4 times, and from CA to AZ a plethora of times and have never been in a bathroom as sick as theres was. Worse part about it was the managers rude reaction. I pointed out the fact that the toilet paper was all wet, making it impossible for anyone to use it and all he did was pile up rolls on the top of the toilet. He didn't even bother asking anyone to clean up the paper droppings; being that the toilet paper was coming off in chunks there must have been at least 20 pieces of toilet paper all over the floor. 

I guess that is why the place was dead at midnight on a Friday. The over priced drinks, the horrible toilet paper and the bartender tossing ice all over the bar each time he poured a drink might also have something to do with it. 

I'm just saddened that with the influx of new businesses going in across the street, improving the area, this place is going straight downhill. The manager Sunny was a smart A-S when I brought the restroom issue to his attention as well. Guess I shouldn't have expected anything more, especially when the first thing you walk through when you arrive at this bar is a cigarette cloud; as you have to go out front to smoke. 

This used to be my favorite spot, but alas the times are a changing!"
1,"I love the food, Karen is an excellent waitress, (the other one sucks) and I HATE THE SMOKE!  

Pay attention people!  Allowing smoke to drift into the building while people are eating is a VIOLATION.  I even asked the manager to put his cigarette out that he left burning in the ashtray and he just ignored me.  When I asked if they could at least shut the door while people were eating he said ""NO"".  Sorry for ya, enjoy your fine!  

PS, get a couple of new speakers for the crap radio station you play in there.  I know you can't hear too well but trust me, those have been blown for a couple years now!"
1,"Overpriced, Terrible service!  I've been a long time customer of this chain, but I won't be going back! 

For a long time I was happy to pay the high price for a great pie, but on a recent trip the poor service left a sour taste which has prompted me to visit the MANY other great pizza joints in the neighborhood.  

The manager was short, snarky and seemed to be put out to have me come pick my pizza up for take out.  When I called from a friend's phone and told him I didn't have my phone but that I was a previous customer and gave him my number, he said he would just drop the pizza at my house and charge my credit card if I didn't show up.   When I did show up and had a beer with friends while waiting he had the audacity to make a comment that if our intoxication became a problem he would have to ask us to leave."
5,"Californians are all about the In-N-Out, where you can get your burger animal style. And the Midwest is all about Culver's, where the Butter Burger is the thing to order.

C. and I ate lunch here on our way between Milwaukee and Mosinee before going to my folks for Christmas. I got a cheddar burger with fries, and C. got the two-piece chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and green beans.

That's one of the things I love about Culver's. Yes, it's a fast food restaurant. But they also do family restaurant food well. The chicken was good and the green beans really fresh, C. said. Fast food you can feel good about.

I also got a frozen custard, their flavor of the day: Swiss almond Christmas or something like that. Chocolate custard with slivered almonds. Yummo."
5,"I love everything Bianco. I just went to PHX last week and ended up at Pizzeria Bianco twice - you may think of me as a bit crazy, but I tell you that in all my travels (Italy 3 times and living in NY), there is no better pizza. 

I enjoy the wait because of this place.. spending 2 hours drinking Peroni's, a bottle of the Green & Red and a plate of cheese is a great way to spend an evening, if you ask me. This place is also about as good as you can get for a date - just not a first one. 

Fair prices and a great atmosphere.. get there early if you want a seat inside and feel free to read the notes that people have written to each other on napkins inside the small table in the corner of the front room."
1,"Can I give this 0 Stars? I guess not. Bottom line, there are no vegetarian options, the produce is really bad, the line was ridiculously long because there was only one cashier in the entire store. I am so disappointed in this Safeway and will not return."
1,The rubber floor mats in my FJ are hooked into a c-hook to maintain placement. The brainiac who cleaned my car ripped the mounts out of the floor to remove and clean them. It's pretty obvious how to remove them without DESTROYING the mounts so needless to say I'm not pleased with this service
5,Ryans pet supply has a wonderful staff in the repair shop. The best customer service in town.
1,"I tried this place, along w/ several co-workers based on the recommendation of another co-worker as we were working at the Phx Art Museum and it was within walking distance. Wanted a light lunch, so ordered a veggie rice bowl. Veggies ended up having all the life cooked out of them(as if boiled for 30 mins), and the non-descript sauce just made this dish an unappetizing mush of heavily overcooked, flavorless veggies and soupy rice. Absolutely awful. I took the rice bowl back to the counter and told that it really was pretty bad, and they sweetly offered me another menu item of my choice even if the price was higher-  so I'll definitely give the counter ladies kudos for customer service. I chose to have the teriyaki chicken bowl as a replacement. The teriyaki bowl was brought out to me shortly after, but unfortunately after taking the first bite, I found that the chicken tasted like straight charcoal. Not like teriyaki, not like chicken, but straight acrid charcoal. I haven't tried any of their other dishes and they may be absolutely delicious, but after two strikes on two simple dishes in one visit, I can't see myself wasting time by visiting again."
5,"I love Culver's as a company, first.  They are solid through and through.  

Each location varies a little, but I think, on the whole, the parent company does enough to keep the franchises in line very well.  I've never been disappointed with any Culver's at which I've eaten.

This location does everything well.  I work near here, so I go here at least once a week for lunch, and have for probably the last four years.  I have never had a single complaint.  Even when they're busy, they manage to keep the place looking well and getting the food out fast and hot.

The only knock I could issue against this place is the layout of their parking lot isn't great.  It could get fixed.  If you park on the right-hand side of the lot, you can get stuck in your space if there's a long line at the drive-thru."
5,"I found the service, food, and environment very fun and enjoyable.  What a neat view to watch the maintenance people get the ballfield ready for tonight's D-Back game.  A fun Friday lunch with the girls."
1,"My poor Arizonian babies...  I'm not sure if Luke is from Chicago or not, but this is not Chicago styled food.  

I just moved to Phoenix from the Windy City in January and I had a hankering for an Italian Beef sandwich.  I started to try out Rosati's which is closer to where I live, but decided I'd yelp first to see what options I had.  Luke's was one of the more popular recommendations.  I stopped by this evening and there was a group of ladies in front of me.  I took a moment to look at the menu, but I already knew what I wanted- mostly just filling the time until the guy at the counter was ready to take my order.  As the girls took to their seats, I was expecting the guy to greet me or ask me what I was having. Not everyone's big on small talk.  I get it.  Welp, the guy walked past me and avoided eye contact, heading into the back.  I waited at the counter, and he came back out within seconds... And walked right past me again.  He was apparently getting some cups for the ladies who were in line before me.  A simple ""I'll be with you in a minute"" would do.  None offered.  So I finally place my order and give the guy my credit card.  He swipes it and sits it on the counter and walks into the back again.  I wasn't sure if he'd actually collected the payment or what, so I left it there.  He comes back out and is shuffling around a bit, finally noticing that my card is still on the counter, then asks me if it's mine.  Then he remembers that I still need to sign off on the receipt.  I get my food, and leave.  Bad service, I'm hoping the food at least makes up for it.  

When I get home, I can't wait to dig into my Italian Beef.  Oh boy!  It was dry and the beef tasted like it had been re-cooked.  People, I'm from Chicago.  You can get this quality of Italian Beef from any hole-in-the-wall place in the city.  Thing is, it'll be about $4.  If you want a better quality sandwich, you'll probably go to an Al's beef location and spend about $6.  For $7.20 here, this place is ripping you off."
5,"As good as it gets.  Thats a pretty good way of putting it! If your into Salvadoran Food or if you are not this is your place.  Located near 14th street and McDowell the building is near a chinese place in an old white building.  You have to park in the back and at first glance you may question yourself for choosing this place.  But it really is worth it.  Once you get inside the place is spotless.  Very well kept.  The menu's do explain what you are eating so no surprises.  

I got the Carne Asada plate.  The steak  was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  It came with yellow rice, beans, a salad, and tortillas.  The tortillas were thick and grilled.  I also shared a bean and cheese papusa.  The papusa was awesome basicly a tortilla stuffed with beans and cheese.  You have to try it.  Our meal came with chips and salsa and a salvadorian slaw mixture to share.  

The price was right and the staff is friendly food A++++++++

Good for lunch if you work in the downtown area not too packed."
1,"Although this retail location appears to be stocked with merchandise, the staff seems disinterested in helping. They would prefer to assist clientele who are on the thinner / fitter/ younger side of life. Anything else they really don't have the attention span for.

As witnessed on multiple visits.

[Head Shake]

Before I dropped a chunk of mass I ventured into this store. I would have spent the world and the moon that day. (The mgr of sales in training at my gym had sent me over to ""invest"" in protein what not.) I had a very specific product to purchase and a list of other ""maybes"".

Yeah, this is before I started eating clean. Anyway, I had some questions. But the same very tall, dark haired lad, had to help a gal. With her cell phone. And then with mints. And some other critical stuff.

I get it. Flirting. Sure, on the job. Go forth, do that.

But when I finally had his attention, he had the audacity to be annoyed. At the actual paying customer. (vs. the gal that works next door and pops in all the time.)

Hoy Vey. Kids. I get 'ya. 
But help the old ones with their wallets wide open next time.

Periodically I would stop in there on my way to Sports Authority. To buy some energy bars. SAME THING.

Then I changed my food vocabulary and never, ever, needed to go in there.

DON'T GO."
1,"This place CLAIMS to be a ""punk rock"" bar  ... it's not what I'd consider a Punk bar ... way to many rednecks ... This is NOT a cool place ... and the booking is God awful. Skip this place and head to the TT Roadhouse ... Hell even the Rogue is better than this place."
1,"Not one but TWO times had to drive back around and give them back the food they handed me. Two times they gave me someone else's food! Every time I tried to check, they told me they were busy and that I needed to pull forward if I wanted to check. 

I just wanted to try their salad. 

Every fast food restaurant has the ability to make a decision: are you going to be as bad as everyone expects, or are you going to take the time to do it right?

Wendy's of 301 E Indian School, I hope you read this. Moreover, I hope you try harder to take the time to do it right. I believe in you."
1,"My mom and I recently started on a quest for the best po po platter in Phoenix. So naturally we ended up here. With the amazing reviews and extremely high prices I was ready to be impressed. I was not. In fact, this was what my mom called ""the worst American Chinese food I've had in my life"". The food was bland and greasy, to the point where we felt so bad that we took the majority of our overpriced entrees to our house just to throw it out. The po po platter (which they called a Bo Bo platter?) was dry and the plum sauce accompanying it was watery. My sweet and sour chicken, was tough and cold. The meat, not covered in what would be a sweet red sauce, was snow White. My mothers 'Desert Jade Shrimp' was, as she said, ""only covered in butter"". The only two good things in this restaurant  was the Mai Tais and the service. I was appalled by this meal. It was not worth the trip."
1,"I was wary about going here but now I know not to ever go again. The atmosphere was fun, our waitress was good, but I gave it one star because I got food poisoning from this place. I ordered the fish and chips and was very sick (stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, bloating, gas) that night until the next couple days. It was horrible. I know it was from the food at Cheeseburger in Paradise. I will never go there again! I don't want others to get sick so that is why I am posting this negative review."
5,"Love the Paisley - it's awesome for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or for graduation parties.  Although I think that may have impacted Tuyen's experience at Paisley.  :) The grad party was awesome -thanks Paisley!"
1,"They tried to sell me a $79 oil change. I had to call my dealership to verify the oil type. It wasn't what they told me. They super up sell products and then don't deliver the best quality. The ""$19.99 oil change and wash"" is actually $39.99. Don't be fooled. As it does not include the wash or amount of oil needed for a full change. Still not a bad price but the principle and sneaky sales tactics make this place sketch."
1,"Worthless.  Everyone in the television department sits around talking to each other.  You basically have to tape $20 bills to your forehead in order to get any attention.  Based on how empty sections of the store are, they must be going out of business.  The furniture department is stocked with things to look at, but rarely is it in stock.  Big profits in furniture....I wouldn't be surprised if they turn into a furniture store."
5,"At tha advice of the reviews on yelp, my family decided to try out this restaurant. Excellent food at decent prices.  If you like Indian food, I would highly recommend that you eat here."
1,"went here with my bf and his friend. came in at 7pm. took 10 minutes for someone to even realize we walked in the door..then took about 35 min to even get our food. they didn't seem very friendly. luckily, the food is pretty good [i've eaten indian food in europe before and it almost stood up to that.] i just didn't care for how slow they were."
5,"The BF and I went last weekend for the first time after hearing great things about it (and after buying a 2 for 1 Groupon a while back).  We were not disappointed.  My only regret is that we couldn't stay longer because there is so much to see.  I really enjoyed ""The Boarding School Experience"".  Very interesting...but very sad.  Can't wait to go back!"
5,"Best take out Chinese in East Madison.  Food is always fresh and well cooked.  Sometimes you have to make sure they didn't forget the rice - mainly when the woman who typically works the front counter is not there.  I have always found the service to be friendly.  Periodically, I have  even received free chicken dumplings or a soda.  By far the best Moo Shu I have found in Madison after living here for 15 years and trying several of the more upscale places in town.

FYI, there is a small seating area here but it is mainly a takeout place."
5,"My favorite breakfast place in Madison, without question. Small town diner fare, but they bake their own bread and pastries. Great service and very affordable. I come here as often as I can."
5,"Super fast, lots of vegetarian options, and the meat options aren't bad either.  I've never had a bad sandwich or salad here.  The staff is always friendly, and the toffee chocolate chip cookies are super good.  I am also confused by the fuss about the prices, because I find Crave to be on par with or even a bit cheaper than...every other sandwich joint I've been to in my life.  Additional shout-outs to: the caesar salad and roasted pepper/brie sandwich."
5,"This place makes me miss when I used to live down in Georgia...but only for the phenomenal BBQ. Seriously though, I haven't found a place with authentic Southern BBQ this north of the Mason-Dixie Line...until NOW!

For lunch, try the sandwich platter. There's a serious amount of food and it will fill you up. Not enough you say? Ok, then go for the half-chicken with the brisket. It's enough to fill up half the Confederate army! The sauces are full of flavor and delicious!

It may look like a hole-in-the-wall but it has 5-star food!"
5,"This particular location helped me out of a potential issue related to closing on my Madison home; the teller, Shaun, was as professional, helpful, and friendly as they come - he's definitely an asset to Summit.

Gritty details:
36 hours before I was due to close on my Madison home, the title company called me to ""remind"" me that I needed to have a cashier's check at closing to cover the downpayment and closing costs. That was the first I had heard of needing a cashier's check... when I bought my house in AR, I just wrote a check and things were good.

Apparently this title company doesn't accept personal checks, which put me in a bind, because my primary bank account is still with a bank in Arkansas. There was absolutely no way I could get a cashier's check from them in less than 36 hours. Eeek!

I have a savings account, a Visa credit card, and an auto loan with this Summit location, so I visited them to ask for ideas/help. They suggested using my debit card (from AR) to do a cash advance into my Summit savings account, at which point they could generate a cashier's check for me.

I called my AR bank and asked them to raise the daily debit limit; they did it immediately. Summit then ran the cash advance, and presto-changeo, things were golden. Total cost? zero-point-zero! So cool.

I've had nothing but great experiences here, and today continued that streak. I was truly stressed, because I stood to lose my earnest money deposit if the closing would've failed. Shaun and Summit saved the day for me. Thanks!"
1,"Went by to grab some happy hour food, but it's closed. Apparently it shut down a couple weeks ago."
1,"This was my first and last experience at Wild Thaiger and I will not be going back. Ever. The service was unacceptable. From the moment my friend and I entered the restaurant the experience was bad. In hindsight, I should have walked out after our issues with the hostess. She repeatedly asked us where we would like to sit, or how many people were in our party, and then she would walk away while we answered or disregard that we had answered her at all. It was like she was incapable of absorbing information. We finally got seated. The table behind us very loudly cancelled their order paid for their drinks and left stating that the service taking too long. The writing was on the wall. At first, I felt like those people were incredibly rude, but now I wish that I had left too rather than enduring a total lack of service. 
It took a long time for us to get water or our drinks. We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our drinks, the appetizer took 45 minutes to arrive, the waiter forgot that we had ordered anything at all, came back to the table to confirm the appetizer TWICE and still brought us the wrong item and then had the nerve to charge us for it! I asked for menu suggestions, the waiter just stared at me blankly. I asked if I could have steamed rice rather than fried, he said that was impossible to change. Impossible. Eventually our entrees came, I ordered soup, it wasn't good. He brought out a teacup for me to use as my soup bowl. It was almost impossible to manage. Then our check came, he overcharged us. I didn't dispute anything because I just wanted to leave. I paid in cash, he shorted me five dollars. I called that his tip, and left. 
The restaurant was not busy, it was typical for a Wednesday night. There is no excuse for their wait times or rudeness. I found the menu to be limiting, and the items lacked enough description. I will never go back. I have no idea how it had such good reviews."
5,"Tropical Fried Rice -- Amazing! They can substitute the chicken with Tofu which is perfect for us vegetarians, and the rice is just so addictive. You can't stop eating it. They don't overdo it or overcook the vegetables, and it's a perfectly balanced meal. I love everything about this place.

The owner, additionally, is very nice and very modest. You can barely tell that he runs one of the best thai places in downtown phoenix. Hands down, my favorite dinner option in central phx. You will come here and be impressed."
1,"I gave it a shot because it looked interesting from the street and had a nice patio.

I went, that's it, I'm done.

I ordered the Blue Plate Special, which today was a chicken green chili plate.

The chicken was quite dry, it came with wild rice (wtf?) and had tomato slices on a bed of leafy greens. W? T? F?

That screams out ""filler"".

There was pico de gallo which wasn't too bad. No idea if it was handmade or store bought, but it was the bright spot in my experience.

To drink I had a belgian wheat beer that was pretty good, but I ordered that one because the waiter said they didn't have Widmer Bros. Hefeweizen.

Despite there being a Widmer Bros. Hefeweizen neon sign hanging behind the bar.

The waitress, who, by the way, appeared to be old enough to have worked at Toms when it opened (80 years) was not good at all. Ten minutes from when I ordered my beer she came out empty handed to see if I was ready to order. When I asked about aforementioned beer she rolled her eyes and departed, returning with said beer, adorned with an orange slice, that I specifically requested it not have.

When my food was delivered, in a MOSTLY timely manner, she never returned.

Ever.

Despite my beer being empty.

I don't think I'll be going back to Toms, nor would I recommend it."

This airline is the worst out there, consistently underserving customers, leaving people stranded, delivering the absolute lowest level of service. It's a shadow hanging over every Suns game."
1,Rude managers combined with a shabby hotel in a sketchy neighborhood.  Apparently these folks haven't realized that we're in a recession and if they want to keep their business they need to cater to customers instead of being rude to them. The manager was one of the rudest employees I have EVER encountered.  I wouldn't stay here again if you paid me.
5,"This place is off the charts good, I had L.T cater my company party and everyone was in love w/ the quality food. If you don't mind the hood then def give this place a try. 
FYI- show up w/ an appetite Bc portions are big."
1,"I have given this burger king a chance MANY times... But they are BY FAR the slowest burger king I have EVER been to... Even if they have no customers inside, and you go through the empty drive through, they will STILL make you pull forward and wait for your meal, one time it was over a half hour! Absolutely unreasonable."
5,"Super cozy diner.  It's small and doesn't have much of a street presence so it's fairly easy to miss if you aren't paying attention.  The diner is a classic boxcar that stays true to it's roots.  The outdoor seating area looks quite enjoyable for a late night snack, though I'm not sure if they are open that late.  Gotta love the outdoor ordering window.  You're best best inside is if you can catch a seat at the corner of the counter.  You not only get a great view of the chef doing the cooking but have a nice fat fan behind you to cool you off.  

We arrived shortly after it opened and chatted with the cook to get his suggestions on what to order.  Very friendly and funny.  The counter's got various coffee table books full of quotes and handy worst case scenario answers.  

I had the Garfield which was a fried egg sandwich specialty.  I can't really recall all the ingredients but the salsa in the sandwich was amazing.  My girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese and it was knock out.  Prepared with olive oil, it was by far one of the best grilled cheeses I've ever had.  The french fries were done just right and the seasoning on them really hit the spot.  The total for both of us including a couple of ice teas was under twenty dollars.  A great deal anywhere.

Just a friendly reminder that it is CASH ONLY!  I had to run to a couple of nearby gas station ATMs since the first was out of order.  Pretty embarrassing but the chef didn't seem to mind and trusted us to return.  Can't complain about any part of the meal and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Phoenix or any locals that have been snoozing on this gem."
1,"I went to this place because it was close and the reviews were good. Not only are they overpriced, but my manicure honestly looks like crap and I have no idea why I even paid for it. I strongly recommend going somewhere else because it was a complete waste of time and money."
1,"If I could give this course no stars, I would. WORST customer service experience of my life. Not only was the manager a complete jerk the whole day, the beer cart girl was lazy and snotty. She literally made a Starbucks run for the employees while she was ""working."" Not only have they lost our company's business for our annual golf outing, but we will never go back for golf league ever again. If you are looking for a good local course in that area, try Lake Windsor Golf Club or the Oaks. Much better courses and they are busy because their staff is professional. Obviously, Sun Prairie Golf Course got the employees who couldn't cut it at a good course."
1,"I just had to chime in with Dave to balance out the ratings on this place. It was some of the boringest (is that a word), blandest pizza ever. I've had better frozen pizzas.

Not only that, the one time I ate there, the dining room was cold as the Grinch's heart, and there was a REALLY-LOUD-TALKING lady there, whose voice boomed throughout the entire establishment."
5,"Ever since my husband (native to Madison) took me here, I always make several trips out from Chicago every year... otherwise my cravings for the Shrimp Creole, Red Beans and Rice with double sausage, Gumbo, Chicken Po' Boy, Jambalaya, and really anything else Roussos has got goin' on that day....will cause me to go into NOTO withdrawal. Oh! And who can forget the Panola hot sauce he uses! There is so much soul in this food and super flavor, but really it's Roussos' own personal touch that makes it so unique. The food is truly special. So get yo' self out to NOTO but make sure to bring your appetite!"
1,"I think Max, Eric & Jason summed this place up pretty well. I dont think I'd ever get a dance here. It was Friday about 10pm-ish we were there about an hour I did not see one attractive girl come out. In fact this was the worst line up I have ever seen...EVAR!! I wont nit pick about the girls I saw but I will not be returning either. Ladies if your feeling down about a little weight gain go here.....hell who am I kidding even i it's a lot of weight gain, do your self esteem a favor and start your night here!!"
5,"NEVER had a bad meal at Blue Plate.  Great for any meal of the day.  Service always good whether you are at a table, at the counter, or outside on the patio.  Plenty of vegan and gluten free choices."
5,I love the fact there is a club like this in Madison.
5,"I love that you can buy a bottle of tequila and a worm separately at this place. Super nice guys at the counter always, good selection, and fair prices. You can't really do much better."
1,"I simply cannot dealing with uneducated ""geniuses"", that think they know everything, when they don't even have a degree in computer science and or engineering. Seriously? Get real."
1,"First of all, Johnny Chu should be ashamed to call himself a chef. He is barely a line cook. As stated in previous reviews, he doesn't even taste his own food (which accounts for the wide margin of variety a single dish may have on two different visits).

So, I made reservations, thinking I may be able to sit at the bar because I arrived 10 minutes early. Wrong. I was ordered to wait outside. Nearly 45 minutes later, and a drink at the bar next door, I inquired about my table. The girl didn't even look up at me to acknowledge I had said anything. After a minute or so of staring at her while she continued to ignore me, she finally said my table was ready. Hmm.

The food is horrible. I fear those of you who enjoy it, rather enjoy the ""atmosphere"" and come here to be seen. The food is either completely bland (e.g., my curry, which tasted of water with a slight hint of something I couldn't even recognize) or so hot as to mask any possible flavor. By calling themselves ""authentic Asian"" cuisine is just silly. There are so many hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurants that could cook Chu under the table blindfolded.

So, the rude, nonexistent service, the insanely overpriced food, and to be seen is what you're paying for. If you enjoy being treated like shit and fed food that I wouldn't feed in a troth for pigs--you may enjoy this place and good for you!"
5,"Love this space.  It's so NYC to me. It's posh and modern and open.  The walls are perfect for large pieces.  The rooms are big enough for incredible installations.  

I have always liked the artists they exhibit.  The last two exhibits I saw there this year were fantastic.  I can't remember the artists name but she took famous paintings, recreated them with spools of thread and when you looked through a piece of glass you would see and recognize the painting!  It was so unique and interesting. 

The last show I saw was Pat Steir, who also happens to be alumni of Pratt Institute, where I went to graduate school in New York City.  So I always enjoy her paintings and exhibits. 

One of the greatest fashion shows ever to happen in Phoenix (Kristin Dinnis and Betsy Johnson) was held in this space.  It was transformed and wonderful."
1,"Ah, the dreaded worst-experience of my life, horrible service, overcharged BIRTHDAY meal...that ended up in moderate-severe food poisoning.

I'm talking the kind of food poisoning where at one point I desecrated the restrooms of a lovely restaurant in downtown Phoenix and ended up laying face down on the sidewalk...to where a homeless man asked me if I was ok.

Yeah.  It was that bad.  Food poisoning aside, it was STILL the worst meal of my life, and this WAS my favorite low-key restaurant in the valley.

Apparently my birthday fell on the last day of a groupon or livingsocial redemption.  Unlucky us, we paid full price (more than actually...since we were charged for the wrong items they brought out and subsequently took back), and were treated worse somehow than the coupon folks -- because it was a set menu and so the kitchen didn't want to make things not on THAT menu -- despite our paying full freaking price.

FACT: When one is celebrating their birthday, they want a cocktail.  I wanted a cocktail.  Actually, I wanted three.  I got my first cocktail after I'd been there nearly an hour (oh yeah, the ""10 minute"" wait I was told about was actually 40).  I didn't get a refill.  Or asked if I wanted a refill. Of that drink, or my water.  But I asked!  Oh, did I ask!   I drank my water and my dining companions.  And then eventually drank the melted ice from my un-refilled mojito. The 2 employees (great staffing job on a day you know will be busy with coupon redeemers!) were basically losing their minds, running around, and super stressed.  They had basically given up by the time we were eating. 

That is why I feel like the food poisoning occurred from something truly awful. Like employees deliberately fucking with my food horrible.

I'm not sure what they normally do when people have their birthday at a restaurant, but we weren't offered dessert menus, let alone a comped dessert.  They knew it was my birthday.  They knew at the beginning we were paying the full price.  And still...worst.service.ever.

***I actually filled out a comment card back in November listing my email address and phone number, where I specifically requested to be contacted (again, this was before the food poisoning).  This review was written right after the visit, and I sort of ""sat"" on it for literally over 6 months, in hopes someone would actually contact me.  I gave them the chance, I guess they really just don't give a shit."
1,"Unmitigated Disaster - We will never be back again, and I would have to recommend (after this experience) for no one to go there either.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were not so kindly greeted by a white haired woman at the front desk. Our reservation was for 7PM, and we got there at 6:55PM. The disgruntled lady tells us to sit in the lobby until it's closer to 7PM... Since when did showing up a few minutes early become a nuisance? Moving forward, we headed towards the lobby to find eight people also waiting to be seated. A little unusual for a Tuesday night, but no big deal - until twenty minutes passed until we were finally seated. I understand that restaurants can get busy, but a simple ""I'm sorry for the wait"" would have gone a long way.

There were two dining areas and we were placed in the larger room. Several tables were available, so I didn't understand the long wait. Anyway, there's an old-fashioned quality to this place... not good or bad. The chairs were uncomfortable and the carpet looked unkempt, but we were there for the food. 

We sampled the Duck Tamales.  Unfortunately, there was nothing special about this dish. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either.  That was the highlight of the evening

While waiting for the main dishes to arrive, it got extremely cold in the restaurant. We hear the staff complaining about the temperature, and then we see another couple complaining to the host about how cold it was on their side of the room. 

Finally, dinner arrives... I ordered the wild boar cooked to medium rare. It tasted medium-well to well done. The waiter stated that this dish comes with five large medallions, but looking at the dish, there were thinly shaved bits of meat. This dish reminded me of the over-cooked roast beef that my dad used to make when we were kids (which I hated, by the way). 

My wife ordered the braised short ribs which tasted like something that came out of a microwave. She tells me, ""For the price of this meal, I'd rather eat a microwaveable meal."" I tried a piece of the short ribs thinking it couldn't be that bad... WRONG. The short ribs were chewy, stringy, and although it was covered in sauce, it was DRY. We hardly put a dent in our meal. 

While waiting for our missing waiter, we noticed that the restaurant was starting to get really warm - similar to a gym. We both started laughing at how horrible everything had been. We were finally able to flag down the waiter for our check. He never once asked us how our meal was - even after seeing our plates were more than half full. 

Anyway, the moral of the story is: Don't waste your money here. Or perhaps call in advance to make sure Vincent is working. While waiting for our car, the valet guy said, ""Vincent is on vacation. His food is phenomenal, but when he's not here, we hear customer complaints."" Maybe this guy is right, and Vincent's food is out-of-this-world; however, based on the service alone, I will not even bother coming back. No second chances for this place - no thanks!"
1,"Even though it is only $6 to get in, this is so old school.  They hand you a 3 ring binder to take you through the tour.  They do not have information cards at each fire truck.  You have to read this small print in the 3 ring binder while minding your children.  The old guy at the front desk was grouchy on top of it all.  Don't waste your money.  Make a donation to the fallen fire fighters instead."
1,"This place is a JOKE! I have been shopping here for years since both my current and previous residences make it the closest market to me. 

They always used to be open until midnight, but nooooo they decided to start closing at 10PM... WTF! I used to always go after work at 10:30 and they would talk about it being the 1030 rush where it would get really busy. What shit for brains thinks it is a good quality idea to close up before your daily rush?

Also the place ALWAYS has long lines. It is not that it's really understaffed, it just seems like most of the employees are fucking off somewhwere. I know most of them by name I shop here so much, and they are not a good group of managers. 

Additionally, they close the deli counter at like 7PM.... seriously, wtf is wrong with this place?

Oh and did I mention some illegal (I have proof he was illegal) backed into my car there and the security guard (not a safeway employee but still should maintain professionalism) told me that it looked like it was my fault. 

Screw you safeway!

See you tomorrow.

Edit, forgot to add how they are always out of their HOUSE BRAND water. Seems like half the time I go there they don't have it. And yes, I agree with other reviews there are always some hotties in there."
1,"Had a few people tell.me about it, like Asian dishes and decided to give it a try. They also serve Italian food, kind of weird. Its not the typical hole in the wall feel. feels like a small coffee shop. 

Got the pad thai and added chicken. Was presently surprised at the amount of chicken that was on the plate. That soon was wrecked when I found multiple pieces of pure fat and the food was bland.

The kitchen staff is loud, saw another employee give the cooks cash (I assume tips) them handle it and not wash hands. I immediately stopped eating, finished my beer and left.

Not a good expierence, I won't be back."
1,"Right after I was about to order a 2nd round of drinks, the nitwits at this place kicked my date out after falsely claiming she was there a week ago during the ASU game causing a ruckus and skipping out on her bill.  The tatted up short order cook (those are the only jobs you will get kids if you get tats) and the once friendly female pudgy bartender were convinced that she was the enemy and must go despite us telling her that she wasn't here during that game. This was a bad case of mistaken identity and if your gonna accuse somebody of that at least have a photo, more proof or something other than, ""you have to call the owner"". If you really recognized her as the person who ripped you off then call the cops man. These two were off their rocker. Well, at least its the last time I have to watch the ""cook"" scoop out potato salad from the giant tub and fry up nasty frozen fish on fish friday."
1,OMG!!! this place is horrible do not ever i repeat EVER!!! order from here...reason::: i ordered sesame chicken and pork fried rice i might has well have went to Fry's up the street and got it frozen and cooked it myself really Canton the economy is bad but C'mon now you can atleast import it from china
1,"Don't waste your time. The waitresses are beyond slow, and once they are done flirting with the table next to you, she might  visit your table and then disappear."
5,"So. Good.

My BFF & I go here frequently. The patio is great when the weather suits, and the inside tables are great when it doesnt.

Their happy hour menu is awesome. Select dishes/ drinks for $5 a piece. 

I havent had a bad item here. From the flatbreads to the bruschetta (the fig and brie is my fave), to the vodka scallops (served in a martini glass) and cheese plates. And oh the cheese, the cheese!

Oh and did I mention their mac and cheese menu? Cuz its bomb. Even reheated, bomb.

Weve never had a bad server here. Even though their attire suggests otherwise, theyre very casual and oh so very nice.

Go here."
5,Awesome BBQ.
5,"Even though we have moved away from CenPho, my husband and I still use this Safeway Pharmacy. Quite frankly, they provide the very best pharmacy customer service I have ever experienced in my 14 years in the Valley. They know us by name. There have never been any hassles with insurance that they have not dealt with immediately. They communicate. They are fast and they are friendly. As a former Pharmacy Tech, I can tell you that their job can be downright awful sometimes, but we have never experienced anything but great service here.

 I have used Osco, CVS,and Walgreens in the past and have dealt with lost prescriptions, crappy service, errors on my prescription labels, and other incompetencies . None of that has ever happened at this Safeway Pharmacy. The only thing Safeway Pharmacy has been lacking that the big chains have is the ability to link to all their stores, but Safeway will have that capability soon, I was recently told. 

If you want both personal and professional service that is quick and error free, then transfer all  your prescriptions from the Walgreens across the street like I did."
5,"Best enchiladas--ever! The enchiladas were as good as any I have ever tasted in San Antonio or Los Angeles.  Simple but delicious: Corn tortillas, enchilada sauce, cheese, and onions (optional). That's it.  And, that's all it takes.  It is rumored that I am the only person to have touched more cookies than a Keebler Elf. That might be true. The claims that Comedor Guadalajara has the best enchiladas in Phoenix. Well, simply put, that's true. These enchiladas are so good that if Comedor Guadalajara was in a rap battle it would simply pull back the foil on a plate of these hellafide gangsta enchildas and drop the Mic!"
1,"I will never order from there again. I called to find out what was on the hot and spicy chicken. The person who answered informed me that it was both hot and spicy but it was serves with broccoli, snow peas and onions. Once I got my entree it was neither hot nor spicy. On top of that, there was no broccoli. Too many onions, barely any snow peas AND a very small amount of chicken. Did I mention that I don't think the chicken was actually chicken? It was cut so thin and had no chicken flavor. The white rice that accompanied my dish was mushy and clumped together. I've made better rice boiling it. My mom had the Kung pao chicken and she was also dissatisfied with her meal. The crab Rangoon was ok... Fairly basic. 

I won't return there. I would prefer to give it a ZERO"
5,"What a great garden!
Be sure to see:

1,"For what it is, a fast food Americanized Oriental restaurant, it's not overly bad, as long as you don't order shrimp.

Service: I've never had a problem here. While not always the most outgoing service, they are friendly. My order is always ready in a decent amount of time. I've never dined in, so I won't comment on atmosphere.

Their menu and nutritional info is easily accessed on line. 

For the most part, I've had OK experiences with the food selections. I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special. 

However, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking. 

I pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite. I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies, but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous, that didn't go well. So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch. 

Lesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs.

**** I thought eventually I'd go back, but I haven't been since then. We had some of their food catered in for work, it was overcooked, rubbery, and chewy. yeah, next time I'll get my own lunch."
1,"We've been going here for 25 years and I had my first BAD meal recently. A rotten chicken tamale, the corn meal might have had rancid fat in it or the chicken was rotten, either way it was stinky. The wait staff didn't seem outraged and shrugged it off as though this has happened before.  I may go back here in another year, but Rosita's Place is off limits for me now."
1,"My female best friend and I were in town for the night, road-tripping.
It seemed like a nice place inside - totally empty, but it was late and a weeknight, so I didn't think much of it. I didn't have much of a problem with drinks, or service until later that night... and that's why I'm taking the time to give this place a 1-star review.

This is a review about a certain bartender, whose name my friend and I never got, but he said he was Chinese and Colombian. 

The area seems to close down early.... even though there seemed to be a basketball game getting out. The bartender said he was closing up early, directed us to another bar (closed when we got there) hand we found a place nearby. Shortly after, the same bartender showed up at the bar, started drinking with us. I don't remember much about the conversation, except for some lies this guy was telling us, saying that he was running the bar after two weeks of working there, that he didn't live in Phoenix, he lived in New York - later, he forgot that he said that, and told us he lived in the same city in California that we did. 
By the time the bar closed, I was getting pretty sloshed, and he proceeded to invite himself to our motel room (I thought my friend invited him, and my friend thought I did), and by the time we got to my friend's car, he insisted I sit in the back seat. 
I'll skip some details here, and make a long story short:

I puked on the ride home, so I spent the rest of the night sobering up. The Chinese/Colombian guy kept pushing weed and beer on my friend (who's a lesbian, by the way) and when you're a man, you can tell when a guy is being a sleazeball and trying to get into a girl's pants. It became blatantly obvious that he was waiting for me to pass out so he could do what he wanted, and so I forced myself to stay awake. Again, I'm skipping on a lot of detail here, because Yelp really isn't the place for that.
After he had long overstayed his welcome (which was never offered in the first place), my friend went to the bathroom, and I mustered all the civility I had left to ask him to leave as nicely and non-offensively as possible. To this, he insisted that unless I reimbursed him for the pot and beer he brought (neither of which I personally imbibed) he didn't have to leave. I bit my tongue.
Shortly after, I could hear him talking about me outside when he and my friend were having a cigarette. I snapped, had to get rude with him, pulled my friend inside and slammed the door in his face. 

The point of this whole review is this:
Ladies, watch out for this sleazeball bartender. He'll try to get into your pants by the most disrespectable means."
1,"Pros:
Drinks are ok
Rib eye steak good medium rare with baked potato
Service was friendly and food served warm
Food affordable
relaxing environment, local feel

Cons:
Scallops was to salty
furniture outdated
walleye fish was eh, not enough flavors

It's very Divey, not impressed even when my meal was free."
1,"First don't tell me I can't sit in the booth when no one is in the restaurant. Service was horrible, we ended up walking out."
5,"The reason I went into this credit union was really because, compared to banks like Wells Fargo and my former bank MidFirst, they had a GREAT interest rate on a simple checking account (for balances over 5k at the time of this review).  I have to say my absolute first impression when I walked in was not super great. No one really seemed all that interested in helping me. Maybe it was just me, it could have been that they had JUST opened their doors and were still getting situated..I don't know. At any rate I left there less excited about banking with them than when I walked in but it did not take long to turn me into a HUGE fan. I can't see myself going to any other bank again thus far. Customer service has always picked up right away whenever I have called,  I even sent them an email and I am not sure it took them 10 minutes to reply.  They have relationships with several other credit union branches that I can walk into and make deposits and transact business with, so even though they only have one ACCU branch near me who's hours are not convenient for me there is another CU about a block that they co op with that is open on Sat and I can go in there. That stuff is all really great but what really did it for me was their website and mobile app. My, now former bank, was not even close to this easy to use and ACCU's website is actually very useful  to me. I am a bit of a tightwad with my cash and like saving my money, this website makes it SOOO easy to track my spending and help me make adjustments. I also used to have to have a paypal account to easily send money to people as my old bank just used to have your everyday  bill pay that every bank has. The payment system ACCU has rivals PayPal in my opinion, for how I have used paypal in the past anyway. Like I said my overall first impression was not super great, I was actually sort of leery about closing my regular bank account after my first meeting but now I almost can't wait to close it. It's not to say MidFirst is bad, they aren't. This is just MUCH better in my opinion."
5,My awesome partner Chuck brought me takeout the other night. Delicious. We had some ribs and pulled pork sandwiches. Love the BBQ sauce. Potato salad was awesome also! Wish we had some good BBQ in Illinois!
5,"I had the okra gumbo, rice and beans, and cobbler to go.  On the 15-min. walk back to my office, the food stayed hot.

Everything tasted light and fresh. Nothing was greasy or heavy. There are no meat products in their vegetables.

It was an excellent meal and I'm looking forward to going back."
5,"Looks sketch from the outside, but true fish fry happiness awaits! I have been going to this place for about one year.  The first time we went later around 9 pm or so and a lot of the fish was gone.  I had an amazing hamburger instead, meat from Jenifer St Market. Besides the first time, I have always gotten the fish.  The perch is amazing and be sure to get the loaded baked potato.  The craft beer selection is impressive.  Chico-the owner is usually cooking, it's a small kitchen, so be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. My fiance usually gets the walleye and loves it. It's now my go to place for fish!"
1,"Boo:(.  My red, white & blue burger was good but I must say the $14 price tag was a tad outrageous.  Not to mention the fact that there is a $3 charge for an upgrade to onion rings when each person at my table had exactly 6 onion rings on their plate!  Yes, that's right 1 burger, with 6 onion rings= $17.00.  Lame!!  This Hardrock is wack in ambiance too!  It is small and boring inside.  The music was barely audible and what I could hear was some terrible pop music that I had never heard before.  The servers must love there job though, the tab suggests a tip of 20%, exactly what you should tip on your $17 burger with 6 onion rings.  The server seemed sweet until she tried twice to upsell us an overpriced dessert.  Save your money and find somewhere else to dine.  Seriously not worth the 30 min wait and messy restroom either!"
1,"We wanted to like Wally's as we live close and like to eat out often. But we have gone there a few times now and we have not had a good experience.  The food is ok, but the service and ambience leave a lot to be desired.  We like to sit at the bar to keep it simple, but the bartender couldn't wait for the night to end. A. request for water was ignored, as well as just ignoring us in general.  We looked around and the servers seemed to be staring at customers hoping they would just leave.  No one greeted us coming in, and true to form, no one thanked us on our way out.  We like to eat out and we prefer to stay close to home, but we will travel farther to go to a restaurant that wants our business."
1,"I was so proud of myself for finally getting around to cashing in the $5 coupon I received for running the 10K Turkey Trot last Thanksgiving, which Mi Amigo's sponsors, and I gotta tell ya, I really, really wish I hadn't. Bad food, worse service. The waitress was hot, though. Rude, but hot.

I ordered the Shrimp & Scallop Enchiladas, which basically consisted of a couple stale tortillas covered with runny cheese, topped off with half a dozen miniature shrimps and scallops. Oh, and a small pile of cold beans and white (white, really?) rice. My date actually grimaced when they brought out the food - grimaced! - and said, ""You're not really going to eat that, are you?""

We were in a drinking mood and surely would have spent good money doing it, but after she brought the food, we never saw the hot waitress again - Ever! - and I actually had to get up and ask another, much less attractive waitress for the bill.

Here's the best part - they took my $5 coupon but didn't apply it to the bill. A-holes."
1,"I've been a regular customer for about one year now. I've come to learn that the owner is the main issue. When he's at the store (not always) he seems to be put off by providing assistance to any customers. He doesn't seem to know how to use all of the store's equipment. And he's particularly rude on the phone. It's too bad, since I actually like most of his staff. Don't waste your time at this store."
1,"I signed up for Yelp solely so I could post a review of Charter. That is how much I hate them. 

If you are new to Madison and you don't live downtown - go with someone else. If you are living downtown, sorry, like me, you're probably stuck with Charter. 

I have been their customer for 7 years, so my list of woes is long, but I'll just sum up the current one:

I canceled my account towards the middle of June. The account was to be canceled as of 7/1. 

On 7/2, I moved. 

On 7/8, I returned all my equipment to Charter. 

7/9 - present, I am STILL receiving bills for this account (now up to $280!). I have called 4 times and received INCREDIBLY poor service. People who were supposed to call me back have not. All have admitted that, yes, my account is showing up as canceled on 7/1, but that some mysterious ""work order"" has not been completed. The current agent I am speaking with told me they actually OWE me $19, but that the account still will not be canceled until the ""work order"" is complete. 

Do yourself a favor and get U-Verse or WHATEVER else is available in your area. Charter has a monopoly on downtown Madison and as such, treats its customers like crap."
5,"Awesome breakfast!!! Had the ""something or other scramble"" and it was amazing, kinda like an omelette that is scrambled but with more cheese!  Breakfast also comes with a super fluffy, light biscuit and some sliced, browned potatoes. Delicious, absolutely delicious. Plus the waiter took pity on us being so hungover and gave me some aspirin, so he automatically ranks high in my book.
The cupcakes are a must have as well. I tried the Fat Elvis and was amazed; banana cake stuffed full of peanut butter and frosted with plenty of chocolate! Now i see why everyone loves the bakery here."
5,Really great Chinese food. Something about this restaurant gives you the impression that the cooks and staff really care about your food. Everything is delicious and there's a sense that it's more 'homemade' than other Chinese restaurants.
1,Found  hair in my food.  BLECH!!  Never ever again!
5,"I hadn't had a donut in years because it was just disappointment after disappointment and I just stopped wanting them. 

I had a random donut craving today and went here. The donuts I got were PERFECT. Light, fresh, airy and delicious. Plus, so cheap."
1,"Just an egg and cheese breakfast burrito, came with random grills scraps.  Just nasty.  Egg tasted like it was cooked with engine oil."
5,"Short review. One of the top five breakfast joints in Madison, and I've been to ALL of them. Excellent food and coffee, and the view isn't bad either."
1,"I used to love this place - I came here once every week or two for breakfast and to sit and write for an hour or two (I'm a grad student working on my thesis). The food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn't great, but the atmosphere is nice and I didn't come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury. The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. 

Today is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am. I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their ""new policy"" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, ""That's exactly how we feel."" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way.

I will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors. If the food was exceptional I might try to swallow my pride, but it's really nothing special. There are several other breakfast/coffee shops in the area (including a Starbucks across the road) and I will be patronizing them instead from now on."
5,"I was staying there to meet with friends and I was pleasantly surprised.  Although it's not new, it was clean and the service was good.  It did have free Wi-Fi and breakfast which was great.  Having a bar onsite is nice as well.

I woul recommend as the location is good and it's clean.  Could use some moderization but clean made it acceptable and above average."
1,"The summary is that I could have been better served and diagnosed by a blind monkey than I was by Dr. Lawrence Kramer and his staff.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm not normally one to be negative.  But I have never left a place of business feeling more disgusted, useless, and violated than I did today.  

My experience: I made an appointment at 11:15.  Showed up at 11:15.  Didn't get in until 12:00.  Then, my appointment with Dr. Lawrence Kramer was shorter than the time the nurse took to measure and weigh me. Dr. Lawrence Kramer cares only about getting you out as soon as you come in to make more $$$$ by seeing more patients.  

And patient beware: he'll try to get you to buy more stuff in the short amount of time he'll spend with you.  First he tried to force a chest exam on me...then it was a flu shot.  And I'm supposed to trust this guy?  He doesn't even try to diagnose the problem, and then wants more $$$ by prescribing stuff that is totally unrealated to the reason why I'm there.  

After my experience with Dr. Lawrence Kramer, I went outside and ran into one of the workers in the building.  I told her about my experience, and she asked about the doctor.  I said, 'I went to see Dr. Lawrence Kramer.'   She said, 'Go figure.  That doctor is the worst.  He only cares about the signing off on tickets.'

Enough said.  Take your kids, your health problems, and your medical insurance far away from Dr. Kramer at the Biltmore Medical Center on Highland.  Hopefully the lull in his practice forces him to reevaluate how he treats his patients."
5,"That's a Wrap is one of the best kept secrets in Arizona. The food is absolutely phenomenal. All of the cleverly named wraps (Ken and Barbie-Que, Tipper And Alba-Gore Tuna, Cheech and Dijon Chicken, Alota Fajita, Etc.)  are made from fresh ingredients and include a side dish of your choice for an incredibly reasonable price. They have a daily special as well as a home-made daily soup selection. That's a Wrap is also very accommodating to vegetarians (you can select tofu as a replacement in any of the meat based wraps). The atmosphere is casual, colourful and relaxed. The owner is super friendly and is very supportive of the phoenix art and music scenes. The work of local artists typically adorns the walls. That's a Wrap is one of my absolute favorite arizona spots. Check it out!"
1,"I been to this place twice as well as once at another location.  At this particular location the food is pretty good for lunch but the staff does not seem to be in any hurry.  When I go to the trouble to dive over to this place during a 1 hour lunch break, I really don't like waiting 15 minutes for what is more or less fast food.  The last time I was there I was kept waiting so long that I finally asked for a refund and left.  You'd think that if your chicken combo (first item on the list) is going to take more than 20 minutes to prepare that they might inform me of it, but instead they just left me standing there.  That won't happen again."
1,"New to Nevada from California, we are trying to establish new restaurant favorites.  We started with Macayo's on Charleston for Mexican food just because we were shopping in that plaza. We asked several people how it was and only one person said it was good. Highly disappointing after we tried it, and we crossed it off our list! 

I usually judge the food by two things:  The salsa, and chile verde. If these are good, the menu is good.  The salsa was crap and there was no chile verde.  They had something like it but the waitress said it's made with beef instead. What?

I agree with the other 1 star reviews."
1,If you're looking for chain Mexican food....stick with Macayos.  I've gotten nothing but bad food here and bad indigestion. Food quality is poor and is on par with Taco Bell.  Just drive a little further to somewhere else.
5,My fiancé came here for a late anniversary dinner around midnight. I ordered a special burger they had called the Jose I believe and my fiancé ordered the Carol. We both absolutely LOVED our food. The burger I ordered had a jalapeno relish with onions and it was just amazing. The Carol was also really delicious and unlike any other pulled pork sandwich we had ever eaten. The staff was very friendly and it was lit cutely with string lights. We are so happy to have a late night spot to dine in Phoenix that's not a fast food restaurant. I absolutely love this place and we will definitely be back!
5,"This place is surprisingly underutilized and minimally successful, judging from the sometimes sparse crowds and difficulty in keeping businesses afloat. Since it is a part of my downtown Phoenix work environment, I love a chance to visit whether it's for a mid-afternoon coffee or an after-work Happy Hour. This is a quaint oasis in the middle of the ""concrete island"" of downtown.

Best things I've have ever seen here by sheer chance include: 1) the Hooters girls practicing their hula hoop skills on a perfectly beautiful sunny day (see uploaded photos), and 2) the Halloween Zombie walk that routed some 300 revelers dressed and zombified through the Center. In addition to the recurrent cliché zombies (zombie businessman, zombie bride & groom, zombie cheerleader, etc.), the best costume had to be ""sad clown zombie"", complete with frownie clownface makeup and a pathetic, anemic little ""aroooga"" bulb horn.

This is a place where I like to people-watch, soak up the sun, enjoy the green landscaping, and grab a coffee or lunch. A break here has the healing power of 100 stolen moments."
5,"Hands down the best flour tortillas I have ever had. I had a carne asada burrito and I couldn't tell you what the meat tasted like because all I can remember is that tortilla. It was soft, thick and flavorful, it definitely made the burrito."
5,I made my way across town to Michael's Jewelers right in downtown Phx.   Although had to pay for parking it's situated in a high traffic area with many business types.  I respect an establishment that gives a warm welcome and caters to their customers.  Got exactly what I wanted and I will go back again.
1,"The customer service including that of the manager Jeff at this Home Depot is the worst I've every received.  I was contacted to pick up a door that I had ordered.  After waiting for an hour, the staff including the manager running the store finally figured out that the someone had set the door up front in customer service (where the rep who called me said it would be) dahhh.  When I commented on how ignorant everyone was the manager started threatening me and I thought I was going to have to call the police.  I have written a letter to corporate about this store and manager.  If you must shop at Home Depot make sure it isn't this one unless you are experienced in Martial Arts.  It truly is the ghetto and the staff reflect it."
1,"If you want to drop $250-$300 & absolutely not impress a date this is the place!!! 

Stuffy, Pretentious, uncomfortable, & Mediocre Summarizes This Venue! 

The Resort entry & valet parking is very impressive! (1st class) 
You will walk thru a beautiful Spanish Hacienda Court Yard to enter this old world decadent restaurant! (Still 1st class) 

""So what's the problem"" you ask? 

Well when you enter this restaurant with a reservation, a snooty hostess will guide to their rather cramped bar to wait for 1 - 1  1/2 hrs. to get your table!(OK it's a popular high end place, & you can practice your art of conversation over the loud volume of many other patrons waiting the same lousy treatment from the hostess....) Oh this is when sticker shock is about to hit you $30-$35 for a beer (a Guinness) & a glass of wine! 

You finally get seated & the waiting staff is doing one hell of a job trying to sell you an expensive bottle of wine! (This part of the experience is very similar to buying Time Share!) 
So you order another glass of wine & beer which makes you seem like a cheapskate, or get treated as such. 

Now the food does taste good, but with rather small portions & rather hefty sticker, it makes you masticate every bite & really taste your dish! But how much am I paying for this dish! 
It's only half a cut of the fish! 
Despite all the mastication, it is very hard to swallow! 
Somehow you finish your dish! (Mom would be so proud of you cause' your plate is as clean as if it came out of the dish washer!) 

So you are now ready for the big finally & the waiters ""Fave Pick"" on desert! Well off course there are two scrumdiddlyumptious recommends that you will have with the two tiniest espresso shots! 
So your bill for $240+ makes its way to the table, & boy if you're planning tipping only 15% you will get the ""you cheapskate evil eye"" walking out of this restaurant! 

Oh 'yah' don't forget to tip the valet, $5 tip also will get you a ""are you kidin' me look as well!"""
1,"Stuff Antiques does have wonderful objects.  It is a good idea to go in knowing what things are worth.  There are no price tags on items and I believe that the owner will take advantage of the unseasoned buyer.  Unfortunately, I did not heed my own advice, and paid way too much for a number of items.  They do very nice restorations, but do not give one even a ballpark figure of what it might cost or when it will be done."
1,"I'm so glad other people have had decent experiences with the Emerald Clinic at the Phoenix VA, because that's not been my experience at all. 3 months trying to get a callback leaving multiple voicemails and still no response. I'm on hold now with the clinic number (referred by a patient advocate) and the line has been ringing for 17 minutes with no answer, no voicemail, nothing. Frankly this is a disgusting way to treat our vets. Better than nothing? Maybe.... (Make that 18 minutes....and counting)"
5,"This is going to sound very weird:  I actually look forward to bringing my Acura in for service here.  There.  I said it.  Why? They are extremely efficient, and they manage to make me feel like a rockstar every time I go in.  Now, I love my little Acura--but having a fling with one of the brand spanking new, sporty little numbers they provide as loaners makes the whole experience feel adventurous and decadent.  Even though I'm dropping lots of moulah on a brake job.  And I have to give the car back."
5,"This is by far my favorite restaurant ever.

I have been coming to Fate for about five years now and never ONCE have I been disappointed with the food or the atmosphere. We are normally pretty lucky and we get Heather who is SUPER sweet and a great waitress. I see reviews about people complaining about the hostess. Yeah, they can be snobby and make life difficult but it is SO worth it.

I would 100% recommend the hot and sour soup. It is amazing. Unfortunately I recently found out it has SHRIMP POWDER so I cannot eat it any more. Another tasty veggie friendly appetizer is the tofu wedges. They come with an amazing peanut sauce.

I have had several entrees, but always come back to the Hong Kong Flat Rice with fried tofu. It is so amazing. Garlicy sauce. They have really amazing yellow curry too. They might put brown sugar in it because it is a little sweet, but perfectly so.

The portions are always great, and you honestly CANNOT beat the atmosphere. It is an old house in the historic district turned restaurant and they display artwork from local artists. 

Stay away during artwalk though, or you will have to wait forever for a table. They are open really late on the weekends too.

At least give Fate a shot once. If you don't like it I will let you punch me in the gut."
5,"this is my watering hole prior to a dbacks game. I always park right behind or next to Cooperstown. I don't think id ever go out of my way to come here except for when i am downtown for a ballgame though.

I usually sit at the bar, everything i have ever eaten here has been good. Love the many options of beers on draft and have met some good people while enjoying the beers at the bar. Lots of large projector screens and TV's everywhere so you can catch up on sports. Still need to eat the big unit one day. When the weather is nice i enjoy sitting outside and using the outside bar for my drinks. 

give this place a try next time your looking to kill time before a dbacks game. I wouldn't go anywhere else (aka don't go to the mexican joint on 7th street because its over priced and lame)"
1,"I used to come here a lot because it is convenient. Its overpriced as hell, and they have shit selection, but the previous owner (?) Steve was nice. They have a variety of stuff, but not a good selection of anything. Cider and wine selections are ridiculous and the staff doesnt know what they carry, so forget about the drive thru. Cant think of a reason to go back really."
5,I have never eaten El Salvadorean food before!  I was looking for something different and saw the reviews!  I called a friend from El Salvador and he suggested the Pupusas with cheese!  THEY WERE YUMMY!!!  Its my new favorite food!!!  I will be back!  Thanks!
1,"I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.

Yes, Majerle's is worse.  

Okay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.

The set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.  

Moreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.  

The bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.

I wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US."
5,"I went here for a friend's graduation dinner. The seating area was filled. We had reservations and they were right on time. The service and level of professionalism was great. The menu is vegan friendly with a few delicious options. I tried a friend's baked eggplant dish and it was by far the best eggplant course I've ever had. Many people in my party ordered the lasagna and loved it. I ordered the pesto and was disappointed. The homemade noodles were good but the pesto didn't have the pop of basil I was hoping for. Despite the pesto sauce, the experience as a whole was great. I would definitely recommend this establishment."
5,"Amazing wedding venue

We had a great experience with The Bentley Gallery and Downtown Phoenix Venues for our wedding. Riette was great to work with. She was super organized and prompt with responses and information. She was also very upfront about any additional expenses and there were no ""suprises,"" so to speak. Riette even helped my on the wedding day with little concerns, like obtaining 2 safety pins for my failing dress! The venue was beautiful and all of my guests were complementary about the venue!!! I couldn't have imagined my wedding anywhere else. It was beyond my expectations."
1,"I actually give this place 0 stars. food-wise, our meal was alright but service was pretty slow. after dinner we ordered tiramisu for dessert. after our server brought it out, we started to eat it, expecting it to be delicious, but no! the first thing we noticed was the disgusting bitter taste and then we took a closer look at the cake. right away we realized the cake was moldy! and I don't mean a little moldy - it was chock-FULL of green mold!!! of course we had already taken a bite because we were not expecting that, so we just started spitting it out like crazy, but could not manage to get the horrible taste out of our mouths. we told our server and he did not believe it at first so we insisted the cake was moldy. he took it away and brought us a fresh tiramisu, which we no longer had an appetite for. the owner came to talk to us when he casually apologized and did not offer to compensate by reducing any part of our bill. the only thing he did for us was give us some free biscotti, which we weren't the least bit interested in. on the bill we were charged for the full meal including the dessert. obviously NEVER going there again! and from now on when dining out we ALWAYS carefully inspect our food before taking the first bite!"
5,"We went to Madison for a friend's 30th birthday in 2006 and pegged this as one of our activities. Fun little brewery, good little tour, and you wouldn't believe how  nicely you can get  a jump start on your buzz just by drinking constantly from the little beer mug shot glass  of samples. Mmm mmm mmm
They have  Bock Fest in February - we are planning on making the trip up there this year (last year one of us was planning a wedding and I was preggers, so we passed).
If you're in the area, go for it!"
5,"there really isn't much to say about this place that hasn't been said in justified prose already, so here's a bullet list.

-SUPER CHEAP.
-just about everything dog-related except for food.
-$25 minimum on walk-in orders.
-super friendly staff!"
5,"I have always had very good Italian food, good service, & great atmosphere.  One reason I have been here several times is because of the convenient location across from the Metro.  This place also has great history, having been here since 1972.  I would definitely recommend this place. =)"
5,"Friendly staff...tons of great ideas and products!  I came here after a disappointing experience at Archivers in the same mall.  From now on, I'll happily come here instead!"
1,"STAY AWAY FROM THESE RIP-OFF ARTIST.  I moved here within the last year and don't know many mechanics in town.  I have always relayed on my brother who is a mechanic at Mazda to service my Mazda for me.  Before moving here my brother did complete check of my car including changing the transmission fluid at 65,000 miles.  I have taken my car to several places to get the oil changed.  Today I needed to have it done again and thought I would go at lunch by work.  I went online and visited their website and even printed a coupon for a complete oil change for $28.99. No hidden cost or shop fees the coupon said.  When I arrived my car was put in line for service. Approximately 45 minutes later a tech can in to tell me that my transmission fluid need to be changed or it was going to burn up.  When I told him I had it done at 65,000 mile at Mazda, the car only has 79,000 miles now, he said that they lied to me and I should go back and get my money back.  Now who should I believe, my brother of 51 years or this 23 year old kid I just met.  I told him that I would take care of the problem myself and he said again, ""it better be soon, this car might not make it much longer.""  When I went to pay expecting my bill to be around $30.00 with tax but was informed that it was $35.48.  When I asked the cashier why, she told me that the oil filter is not included in the oil change.  Who does a oil change without changing the filter?  I asked to speak with the manager he was not available.  When I told the tech that I would just pay the bill and not come here again and YELP their business, he said ""DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.""  So buyer beware of this place, they will rip you off when ever they can."
5,"I went here twice when I visited Phoenix in late May, early June, 2008. This place is awesome! The group I went with and I had quite an experience. Right after we ordered our food, we noticed some men with television equipment were setting up the table behind us: turns out they were filming Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations! Lo and behold, sitting alone at the bar was Mr. Bourdain himself, drinking  beer. We took a couple pictures with him, and spent the rest of our meal peeking over our shoulders at the filming of the episode. Alice Cooper showed up, it was a great interview! You can actually see me in the background throughout the segment, I'm wearing a tie dye tank top. The food here was awesome, if that's even worth mentioning. If ever I am back in Phoenix, this will most certainly be a stop for dinner or lunch. The staff is fun, with their Cooperesque eye makeup and fun personalities. I'll always remember my trips here, and I'm grateful for a great story to tell! (On another note, Alice Cooper is the shit! He's so nice, and funny enough it was my second time meeting him...first time was at my church in my hometown in IL. Believe it or not, it's true and I have the autograph to prove it!)."
1,"OK. Do not judge me. Do not send me scornful, hurtful messages. And do not preach to me the hazards, both socially and physically, of eating at buffets. Because, frankly, I've done that to myself already. Eating at Mexican buffets was part of the bf's growing up days in San Antonio. One day he asked me to go, and since he's irresistible to me, I said yes. Upon entering Pancho's, I realized it was like a Mexican Chuck E Cheese. More kids than you'd find at Mia Farrow's house. Running in between and around my legs. Screaming, laughing, crying. Totally out of control. And this is all while we're standing in line. Suddenly I find my throat to be dry, irritated and burning. Why is there a white haze wafting from the hallway? Oh. Some darling little child had activated the FIRE EXTINGUISHER! Yea. And mommy was too busy ordering her Dos XX to notice. You'd think this would have sent us running. But we persevered. I thought I'd be safe and get a taco, enchilada with beans and rice. All were simply horrific. Malo. Horrible. No bueno. The more I recall this day, the more I feel a need for a buffet support group of some kind. Hello, my name is Thomas. I ate at Pancho's. HELLO THOMAS! Good bye Panchos."
5,"Pretty straight foward, I like the fact that I can ride up to the back and walk right in then ride right out. I dont have some HD salesman to deal with behind a counter, and well, these guys been changing wheels and thats what they do. So like, I liked it. They also found my back brakes to be low. Changed them  too. Not bad. Price, may have been a little bit on the up side, but I cant be sure as I am not motorcycle tire replacement and oh hey we found your rear brakes bad so lets change them pricing expert."

5,"New Orleans Take Out is all around greatness.  I absolutely love this place and everything on the menu.  When I was a kid the best times were when my father would take an afternoon delivery to the east side and swing by NOTO on the way back.  It was always such a great surprise when my sister and I would be called in for dinner, and right away you could smell those spices!  Those are some of my favorite memories, and to this day I get a rush of excitement just walking in to the place when I get that first waft...  It really is the best outside of the Gulf.

I really can't even start on what my favorites are because every time I pick something off the menu it becomes my new favorite.  The po' boys are without exception great.  The roast beef was my first love, and I keep coming back to this one.  The French bread is perfect - crisp and the perfect texture for the sandwich.  It took me a while to try the fried oyster po' boy - I was not so adventurous as a kid - but after trying this I see why this is my mother's favorite.  The Gulf shrimp and the fried chicken are incredible.  This place is a 5 star easily on the strength of the po' boys alone, but the rest of the menu is not to be skipped.  The jambalaya is great for those that can't take too much heat, and even better with a bit of Tabasco for those that can.  The shrimp creole - HOO BOY!  Spicy but not excessive, it has enough heat to get you sweating and the flavors are spot on.  Same for the shrimp etouffee.  The red beans & rice with double sausage is my all-time favorite comfort food.  Most of the time I can't make up my mind, so I hit up the Mardi Gras combo, which gives you all three.  Perfection!  And it all comes with a piece of cornbread to finish it all off.  

I've only been to the Fordem location, though there is another on Monroe Street.  I'm certain that had I not graduated prior to this location opening I would have made it a regular destination.  As it is, I love coming down Sherman then Fordem, and you're suddenly right there looking at the mural on the side of the building.  I call ahead whenever I plan to stop, but about half the time it is straight up impulse that brings me there.  No matter whatever else happens that day, it's always a good day if you've been to New Orleans Take Out."
1,"I gave this place a second try because i figured maybe we got all the wrong stuff the first time. Also because my friends are always raving about this place. So we went back to try the deep dish and waited over 45 minutes for a table (what a waste) and after ordering and praying it was gonna be as amazing as everyone says it is, it was....

DUSGUSTING!! I barely finished one slice. This place is SO OVERRATED. I think food out of a garbage  just might taste better. All I know is if I had the option to eat at this place or the gargage, garbage would be my solid number one choice."
5,"this is a fun and funky place. any music lover would like this place. yes, it's done in an alice cooper theme. there is a large variety of collectable rock and roll memorabilia on the walls signed by a variety of artists. there are gigantic tvs for any sports fans. these tv are seriously huge. the menu is fun and is fairly extensive. the food has always been really good. they have burgers, sandwiches, ribs, chicken, etc... appetizers.  the burgers are large and the sandwiches are large. they have a killer reuben. these are not plain jane sandwiches. they are done on quality breads and stacked with alot of meat. they have a large selection of sides of your choice and they are all really good. they taste very homemade, authentic and just good quality. they have indoor and outdoor dining. it's two level. it's a cool place and would be a great place to take an out of state guest. their desserts are huge. great place all around. there is a long bar with fair drink prices."
5,"Phoenix Theatre consistently puts on excellent productions. As a jaded ex-New Yorker, I was honestly worried about finding ""culture"" when I moved here. Never fear. Between the theatre here and the touring productions elsewhere in Phx, and the opera, ballet, and symphony (not to mention Spring Training and the beautiful Phoenix Art Museum), I'm not missing out. 

Definitely worth subscribing to their season. 

And be sure and arrive early, they've renovated the lobby (and added a black box theatre for more intimate shows), with a snack bar (sandwiches a bit overpriced but reasonable pre-show drink prices) and a bar-bar for hanging out."
5,"By far the best Mexican food in Phoenix! Wonderful service, great atmosphere!"
1,"Boy was I disappointed and embarrassed. I had friends visiting from out of state, and I told them that Honey Bear's was the best bbq in town. We arrived Sunday night around 7pm. They were out of ribs...My friends ordered the rib and chicken combo. One substituted the rib tips for the ribs,  and the other friend ordered sliced beef. I ordered a half lb of pulled pork and two sides. They ended up ""finding"" some ribs for one of the orders, but there were obviously boiled or pressure-cooked and not slow smoked.. The chicken came out 10 minutes after the rest of the food, and it was also either microwaved or pressure cooked.. My food, (which was ordered a couple of minutes after theirs) took over 30 minutes to arrive.  I overheard them telling the people sitting behind me that they were out of almost everything..

Then, to top it all off, we were overcharged.  We showed them a four square check in which was supposed to get me one free side, but I was still charged for both my sides. The cashier girl was new and obviously in WAY over her head. 

I was so embarrassed after raving about this place, to have it be so very bad..."
5,"Coronado Cafe is great! Excellent Happy Hour deals, great food, great drinks, great atmosphere. This is one of those places where the staff enjoy being there and it shows in the service they provide, the food is wonderful, and you can actually sit and relax for a meal. It is very small and intimate place. If you bring a group you should know they do not split checks."
5,"I take my westie to Lori's and every time they are super friendly and do a beautiful job with her. I'm very picky about her haircuts too. She jumps out of the car to run inside - which she doesn't do at some other groomers. I love they have daycare so she plays all morning and then gets groomed in the afternoon. Last time I accidentally showed up on the wrong day and they never even mentioned it - they just fit her in anyway. And..their prices are in-line with everyone else in town, in fact they might be a little less."
1,"I have been here on two occasions and both times their crab puffs were cold in the middle (probably fried from being frozen, not fresh). Their beef lo mein had a strange flavor to it, did not like the sauce. And their sesame chicken was unlike any other I've had at other Chinese restaurants. My concern is the freshness of the ingredients: seems like they are either using frozen or canned. This place would be a hit if they just went to a grocery store every day and only cooked the freshest ingredients cooked to order. The kitchen seems busy and adequate enough, but the restaurant seating area is empty (at least the two times I went there). I get the impression that this is a large family-owned restaurant that has gotten lazy over the years. Gordon Ramsay needs to pay a visit."
5,"Inviting, comfortable, quite, homey, elegant, and friendly are words that come to mind when thinking of our stay at the Speckled Hen.  

My wife and I came here for our anniversary and we were not disappointed with any aspect.   Upon arrival we were met by the Inn Keeper, Pat who gave us a warm welcome and brief tour of the gust areas and our room.   The guest area, or as they call it, the ""gathering room"" is very warm & inviting.   Here you can sit to meet with others, read a book, select a wine, or enjoy complementary drinks such as coffee, tea or soda with some light snacks available as well.   The freshly baked cookies are awesome.    There is also a computer to use if you wish and there are several binders and folders with local attractions or restaurants to try out.   

Our room, the ""Madison Lakes"" was outstanding.  Large, and outfitted extremely well. You will not be disappointed.  There is a king sized bed, a gas fireplace, nice sized TV, with good cable channels, or use of a DVD (you can borrow DVD's from the gathering room), free wifi, a small fridge, sink, and two comfortable chairs to melt into.   The bathroom is ginormous, with a large whirlpool tub, a huge walk in shower complete with steam and rainfall shower head, all of it being very nice.   

The grounds of the Inn is really a small farm, with fruits, veggies & fresh laid eggs that find their way into the ingredients for breakfast.    Around the far there are several trails to use, winding you past the barn, sheep, a lama and various beds for wild flowers, herbs and vegetables.   

As my wife and I walked the grounds and headed back to the Inn, we passed a good sized gazebo which seemed to beckon us in for a look.  Inside there are a few comfortable chairs, wine cooler,  a DVD player (with aux connections) and some wine glasses just waiting to be used.   We sat in there for a while and we actually had plans on going out on the town.  However, this entire scenery before us was extremely relaxing... the woods, birds singing, farm animals grazing about, all made for an extremely, wonderful  relaxing environment we simply could not walk away from.   So, we concluded our evening by enjoying ourselves in this tranquil environment accompanied with some wine.    Ahhh... a very memorable time which we shall cherish for some time to come.   

After a sound sleep and outstanding shower, we headed to breakfast where we dinned with two other couples who clearly were enjoying their stay as well.  The breakfast freshly made by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob, is made up of several courses; fruit, scones, beacon and eggs, all of which was eaten with delight and a perfect ending chapter of our stay at the Speckled Hen Inn B&B.  

The attention given by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob is perfect.  They have really taken care of many of your needs in advance simply by setting up the Inn & Grounds really well.  They are both attentive and engaging while at the same time not being overbearing.   They really do have it well balanced!   

Obviously, my wife & I will be checking back in here again.  So, if you are looking for a place to get away from to unwind, (which is only a short drive from the Capitol Square) or in need of some quite time, then this is the place for you!   

Thanks Speckled Hen, for such a relaxing time and creating some wonderful memories!!!"
1,"Terrible this will be their final chance, after an hour half they forgot to vacuum the back!! There was trash under the seats, windows had streaks . The exterior had dried water spots . R u kidding me ??!"
1,"I'm not really fond of writing sub par reviews. I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my ""I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends"" template.
 
 Majerle's is one of those experiences.

I know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.
 When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.
 
   If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check. 
  Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. 
Not so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.
Downright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.
 If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not."
1,"Apollo's was a fun experience, until I checked my bank account and find the erroneously overcharged me over $35.00. When I called they tried to tell me it was a debit ""hold"" for tip. It was not. This was a week later and the charge went through. They said they would have someone call me back. They did not. I got the run around and they gave themselves a very generous tip at my expense. Have fun, but check your bank account, they don't play by the rules."
5,"I was one of 50 people who went there to get Adam's Big Unit.  The service was top notch and they move fast and get work done.  And the hot dog was sooooo huge and soooooo good.  I shared my picture of eating the big unit with Sebastian Bach and he commented back on it because it was so enormous!  It had great flavor and my favorite brioche bread.  I will be going back to attempt the dog on my own.  I am a tall skinny girl but I have a true appetite so I will definitely get that 22"" hot dog down no problem.  I highly recommend Cooperstown.  It is a great place to have good food and have a great time!"
1,"Terrible service by the sales staff on the floor of the store. I was in a discussion over a item that I was buying for my wife and the sales person allowed a young lady with no apparent manners to interrupt and ask a question that went on to a conversation as if I was no longer there. I could  allow a quick question, but to engage in a ongoing conversation, by the staff associate and the rude customer who interrupted was to much. The sales person should have had the training to be professional and tell the person to wait a moment instead of engaging her as if I did not matter. F$%K this place and the management who allow this type of behavior..Shop elsewhere.."
5,Life is good. In bloody mary heaven. Joy's not bad either :-)
1,"I rarely post or comment unless I feel that I have been taken advantage of. Now, I am an average consumer with a college education, however, I am not familiar with HVAC systems at all. So, I am posting this in the public to hopefully help other consumers to not fall for the ""Spring Tune Up"" Offer by All Comfort Services @ 5245 Voges Road Madison, WI 53718. 

In full transparency I am also posting copies of the quotes & receipts from the technician. Here: https://plus.google.com/u/0/111026625881803880071/posts/PKBhrxTNQs7 

Scenario: 
- I found a special on Angieslist for $139 for a technician to come to my house for a spring AC Tune Up. 
- My system is 23 years old, and the furnace has been very well maintained works fine. 
- The technician was at my house for 45 minutes. 

1. Replaced my furnace filter. 
2. Put ""Comfort Services"" stickers all over my furnace (and removed the competitors) 
3. I showed him how to turn on my thermostat (I have a nest) 
4. Hooked up the gauges to the AC and ran the system 6. Stated that I have a very small amount of freon, and that it is cost prohibitive to find a leak ($435-$600, and recharge $161). 
5. Recommended that I buy a new AC unit and furnace 
6. Charged me $139. 
7. Scheduled a Salesman to come to my house 2 business days later to sell me a new A/C & Furnace system for between $7,679 - $8,742. 


Since then, I have had 2 other HVAC companies visit me and make other recommendations and provide a complimentary ""leak check"" by loading in nitrogen and offering me some other options. 


Conclusion: I've decided to recharge the freon in my system through another HVAC company and they will come out in 2 months (free of charge) to test my pressure again. My honest opinion is that All Comfort Services uses their technicians to generate leads to replace full HVAC systems. In the future I will not be using All Comfort Services and taking my business somewhere else."
1,"Had a buffalo chicken sandwich with fries and a ""side of beans.""  Absolutely horrible.  Not only were the beers over priced, but the chicken was burnt, fries were cold and the ""side of beans"" came in one of those small plastic ketchup cups, like this:  

http://www.lulusoso.com/upload/20120320/disposable_plastic_soy_sauce_cup_portion_cup.jpg

It was like a shot of beans.  They need better cooks.  Won't be going back, there's plenty of other places around downtown Phoenix to go to."
5,"OMG!  The bakery items at Pinecone are AMAZING!   Cinnamon rolls as big as your head and absolutely scrumptious!   The food in the restaurant is great for truck stop food.  We've only come for breakfast but stop every single time we head up to Rhinelander,  WI.  Do NOT miss this place if even only for their baked goods!"
5,"Wonderful little burger joint!!  Very simple menu: hamburgers, hot dogs, and (Garfield) fried egg sandwich.  Everything is fresh and the burgers are like a thing from the past (fabulous)!!!!  Very little in and outside seating- most importantly its cash only!  Worth the drive! and an experience you shouldn't miss!"
1,"My coworkers and I stayed at the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel in Phoenix, Arizona in March 2012. I was sharing a room with two other female colleagues and were appalled at the service we received during our stay. We were already upset with being relocated from the Renaissance Downtown Hotel a few days prior to attending the conference and the awful customer service provided by the hotel added to our negative overall experience with the Marriott franchise. 

Early Tuesday morning, two men came pounding at our door at 2 a.m. They identified themselves as a security guard and a worker at the hotel. They stated that this was our second warning and demanded that we open the door. This was quite alarming being that we never received a first warning for anything and were sincerely concerned about our safety. 

When we called the front desk to inquire if the two men standing outside were part of the staff of the hotel and to explain to guest services that we should have received a phone call from guest services in the first place, a guest relations worker by the name of Caroline asked us if we planned to continue with the noise level and responded with an unwarranted attitude that there was laughter heard from our room and someone in the room next to us called to complain. We were taken aback by her attitude because while we would have been more than happy to bring our noise level down, we did not expect a representative from guest services to be the one to talk back or respond to us in a matter that was rude and unnecessary when all we wanted to do was to explain to her about our concerns because we did not feel safe. We were extremely alarmed by the way the hotel handled the situation because we felt like our privacy was violated and our safety was jeopardized by these two strangers demanding us to open the door at 2 a.m. To make matters worse, when we brought this issue to the attention of the Front Office Manager, Camille Cobos, she simply made no effort to be apologetic or explain to us why this situation occurred. She simply brushed off our concerns and nonchalantly thanked us for bringing the matter to her attention.

Our office and many of the administrators and faculty at our work frequently travel to various locations across the United States in our line of work. We often choose the Marriott as a top hotel choice for our stay. However, this awful experience at the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel has made us question the quality of customer service their staff provides to their clientele.  Several of my colleagues also expressed other concerns regarding their stay at this particular Marriott as well. We wrote a letter to the Marriott corporation as well as to the hotel and we have they can take this important matter into consideration and provide positive experiences for current and future Marriott guests as we would not want them to have the same experience as we did. There has not been a response from any Marriott representatives so far since we sent in the letter early March."
1,"I am from out of town and have never been to a restaurant at a ball game, so I was excited to go to Front Row to watch the DBacks game. The website gave very conflicting messages about when you could purchase the seats in Front Row for the game, so I gave the restaurant a call over a week in advance. They said I could only purchase tables the day of. I called the night before the game, hoping that maybe they would make an exception because I really wanted these tickets. I then found out that the tickets have been available all season! I asked to speak to the manager, who was the rudest human being I have ever spoke to in my life! After about an hour on the phone with him, tears, and being called a liar, I decided to hang up and just call customer service. I understand that the table I wanted had already been reserved, I just wanted the manager (Lyle) to try to help fix the issue. He said there was nothing he could do, and that ""EVERYONE knows you can buy the tickets all year round""... what a piece of crock. I cannot believe I was talked to in the way that he spoke to me, and I am so thoroughly upset and aggravated at him. I just read some previous reviews about him on this site, and it's so funny that everyone agrees with me. If you don't have any issue when you go there, then you'll be fine. But if you have even the slightest complaint that has to go through Lyle.... don't expect to leave happy."
1,Never again!!!!  The worst customer service and communication I've ever experienced. They should all be fired and start fresh or I can guarantee this location will be gone in less than a year. HORRIBLE!!
5,"OK.  It is not a 5-star place.  But I had to give the 5 stars in order to offset the ratings to date.  I went there because the Isthmus Annual Manual said it had great wood-oven pizzas.  I ordered their signature Benvenutos pizza (with ingredients similar to some chain places' ""supreme"") and tap water.

This was an extraordinary pizza.  The crust was explosive, the ingredients were pleasing  (I went to a boutique, Sicilian-personally-owned pizza place in Madison last week - - which I charitably did not rate on Yelp - -  where the otherwise-droolingly-pretty and well-assembled aggregations somehow tasted plain and  DULL - - you have to BUY good basic INGREDIENTS).

The truly odd thing about Benvenutos are the aesthetics.  It is situated on a desperate strip mall, with a hideous bland exterior, that makes you think it is some pretend restaurant, living on pretentions alone.  The pretentions continue as you go to the giant counter.  And then there is this quasi-industrial interior, with huge industrial ceiling-fanned ceilings, cute semi-Vegas-italian- buffet faux-italain scrawlings on the strange pompous facades, all amidst these massive spatial proportions that are wholly intimidating, and make you think you are either in some very, very SPECIAL hallowed unknown reclusive monastery purveying mama's most lustrous home-style concoctions (which you know isn't true), or you are in the most prepostrous strip-mall farce that has ever been created

It's a little of each, but amidst this aggregation of disparate elements, the proof is in the pizza, and the pizza is incredibly good.  A  billowing perfect crust - -  superb textures all around - -  ingredients with satisfying flavor - -  a PERFECTLY constructed pie (texture, flavor, appearance - - you name it).  Nice serrvice.

I'm going back."
1,"1990's this place was the best club around.  Now it's the worst. I mean sure there are a few boobies to look at but that's about it.  

The girls don't talk to anyone and ask if you want a table dance.  I checked around the room a few times and other than the three dancers on the three stages THERE WERE NO OTHER GIRLS TO BE SEEN IN THE PLACE, (well other than the ones in our party, but they weren't dancing).

We tried asking the servers to bring us some dancers, and nothing.  We tried to make it rain money on the dancers and told them to come back and nothing!  This was a ""busy"" Saturday night so you would think the dancers would on their A game, but nothing. 

If I'm gonna go to a titty bar I at least want that stripper perfume sent on me next time!  I going to check out Band-Aids next time"
1,"I thought this hotel was horribly over priced. The locations bad,  they said they renovated the ruins, but there nothing new or impressive about them. Overall I think I would have had a better stay staying at a motel6. The sheets smelled slightly so I slept on top of them. The shower didn't drain, so I felt dirty afterwards. They had very limited cable. The tv was fuzzy. You could hear all the traffic that pulled in our drive down the street. There was no wifi. Over all. I think this was I've of the wheat hotel stays I have had in a very very long time."
5,My family and I have eaten here at least a hundred times over the years. This is one of two spots we eat lunch at if we are near downtown Phoenix. The price is right and the service is always excellent as is the food. The family who runs the restaurant is always very friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone. My only complaint is that they only have one location in the valley.
5,"Great prices, good selection that is constantly changing, and it's usually pretty busy.  What more can you ask from a used book store?

The staff is pretty nice, though it seems like every time I walk into the store, the music they're playing is some of the most god-awful foreign jazz stuff."
1,"This place looks nice when you walk in, but don't expect any customer service. I've been in twice to use a computer during my work day and both times I've had both printer issues as well as employee incompetency issues. The people there don't seem to think they need to help you and would rather sit behind the counter chatting. When I finally got someone to come over to help they made the problem worse and ultimately resulted in taking an insane amount of time trying to get refunded for their mistakes which they wouldn't even apologize for. 
Ps James, member since 06... you'd think you'd learn how this stuff works by now. Also, your a jerk."
1,"I've hesitated to write about Fate. I always enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon, even back when it was on University. I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.

We've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it. 

I'm not really high on the ""this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time"" style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco. 

I don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.

The server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.

Anyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- ""the food here is terrible... and such small portions!""

I'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us. 

Anyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough. Oh, if you're uncomfortable with IKEA furnishings (I'm fine), don't even try it."
1,I've been going here for years but enough is is enough.  Last straw was Friday night and I walk in at 6p and they are out of salsa... Like the whole salsa bar empty (the one with the broken sneeze guard that hasn't been fixed in over a year).  How the heck does that even happen?  Place is dirty too.  Doesn't seem like they have a manager there anymore.  When across the street to Chipotle and never going back.
5,"I've seen more than a few convention centers and expo halls in my travels, and who knew the coolest one was in my own backyard? 
This is dorky - but I know you'll totally get me if you've ever trekked across countless useless square feet in heels, lugging countless brochures and promos you've been given; if you've trampled over mounds of used paper towels in a depressingly lit, dingy bathroom; if you've ever had to sit in a hard plastic chair for an hour+ and listen to a rumple-suited guy drone on and on about synergy and sales figures; if you've ever been subjected to ugly corporate art ... OK, I'll stop there - but I LOVED the Phoenix Convention Center!

With a swell new renovation, its gorgeous in contemporary rust and sand and other deswet appropriate colors (god, I'm glad Arizona finally got away from the ""sunset"" color scheme of pink, purple, orange - blech!) and fancy tile entryway. It's clean, modern and has TONS of windows and open space. When you enter the West Building from Second St (the entrance by Starbucks), you're sort of swept up, up, up to the sky, and it really makes a statement (the entire entryway/first floor is open all the way to the top).

The seminar rooms have all the hi-tech gadgets needed for presentations, and the AV/Tech guys were professional and prompt if there was a problem - and, might I add, some of the most well-dressed techies I've ever encountered. No band T-shirts, visible tattoos or bears* here, man, it was all long-sleeved button-down shirts and dress pants; impressive!

My favorite part? Wicked-comfy chairs in the rooms. No hard plastic and metal legs, no cumbersome, heavy, office-gray uncomfortable torture devices. The chairs were super sleek - those mesh-back, rolling office-desk chairs you always see in design studios and architecture offices. By the way, did I mention the backs *recline*. I'm totally serious. I'm a super antsy chair sitter - I sit up, I slide down, I cross, re-cross, pull my legs up Indian-style, under me, I turn (doubly insulting to speakers if the chairs are squeaky)... I can never sit still in an office chair, but these bad boys made me feel like a grown up finally as I could sit quietly for a full hour.

Bathrooms were incredibly nice - large-tiled floors that were actually clean, small-tiled sink backsplash in contemporary colors, soap AND paper towels in full supply AND the automatic water faucets ACTUALLY all worked! It's a convention center miracle! A full-length mirror for making sure your conference appropriate attire looks as nice as you thought it did at 5 this morning. Nice, floor to ceiling, all-glass (frosted) doors with the long bar, brushed steel handle (what can I say? I'm a sucker for a cool bathroom, just read any of my reviews)

What else.. it's right off the light rail, of course. I found the entrance easily, no wandering around an entire city block looking for the right door. Up on the third floor, the windows provide a great view of the city streets - p.s. what's with the towering TMobile ad painted right on the Bank of America building?? Oh yes, super hi-tech looking TV screens outside each room that display in color the current and upcoming sessions - helpful, because it never fails that someone moves or changes the signs and you're left wondering if you're in the right place. 

Also, I liked that the convention center chose to work with a caterer who uses compostable plastic cups made from corn...say what?? And they have recycle cans alongside regular trash cans for all those empty water bottles.

OK, the one thing this place does have in common with other convention centers is that it is FREEZING. Of course, that is to be expected no matter where you travel.

**This is actually supposed to be ""beards"" but for the record there were no bears either"
1,"The dish I had, the wasabi crusted ahi tuna was awful and it was served twice, both times unacceptably.  The ""crust"" is really bread stuffing on the outside and the miso glaze was a miso cream sauce, huh?  How can you call a rich, greasy sauce served on the plate a glaze.  Very confusing, unappetizing and this dish should be chopped.  Not a good experience."
1,"We are new neighbors just up the hill in Paradise Valley, and we SO wanted this to be our ""go to"" dinner place for nights when we were too busy to cook and to take visiting families and friends.   Full disclosure:  we tried four times, each time it was around 8:00 pm. Two of the four we were treated pretty poorly by a female hostess. There were still patrons eating in the restaurant, but she told us they were getting the main dining room set up for a big event the next day (both times) and sat us in the bar. Last night, there was a basketball game on in the bar...I would not mind eating in a pub atmosphere if we were paying pub prices. So, when we told her that the noise was too much and asked to be reseated in the restaurant she refused. I don't think was too much to ask, for just the two of us. And it's interesting the other two times we went, the male hosts gave us the choice, and sat us in the restaurant.  Food has been inconsistent, but not all that bad.  Pasta on two visits was all small pieces (spaghetti one night and fettuccine another) like we were getting the dregs. I'd be more tolerant of that, but for the price of the food, we expect a more pleasant dining experience.   Too bad.  They need to make some changes."
5,"I'm in love. I'm going to give this grocery store the highest praise I can - it's a cross between Brennan's (great fruit but mainly noncommercial items) and HyVee (great Iowa grocery store with normal items). I love the mix of items, the great looking fruit and Oberweis milk (I miss their Illinois stores with delicious ice cream too). It's really not that expensive and I can get everything all in one place. I was worried given the caliber of grocery stores I've found but this is the real deal. The people were nice and I'll be coming back again soon!"
1,"This place sucked today! We asked our waiter for a little time to look through the menu and he really must've took it to heart because he came back 15 minutes later. 

Second they added 6 tables together to the middle of the floor for a huge rowdy group of Dick and Janes. Why come to Applebee's if your rolling 30 deep dude. They stood up in the aisle and laughed like fat girls the entire time...eat already. Btw it was so packed with them smack dead on the side of our table, that the waiter handed us our food and drinks from the other side of the ramp. Now I'm pissed.

So the food finally comes out...yeah the food that was handed over the ramp, and the plates were hot but the food was luke warm and disgusting. 

So all in all, I usually like this place, but are you so damn desperate for some happy hour change you'd forgotten this is a fire hazard?! Silly rabbits."
1,"I will never go in this restaurant again. I have been there several times, with each visit the manager being more rude and insulting than the last time. My friends could not believe the things I told them he said to me during my last (definitely last) visit.

You can get better New York food elsewhere without the New York attitude.

Complaints to the headquarters go unanswered. So I assume Schlotzsky's does not care about customers."
1,"I have noticed the trend in all the location but today was the worst.  Coffee was cold and the cream was warm.  The lettuce had a faint smell of bleach or ?  There was almost no breads out but a few drier ones.  I took one and it was cold and soggy.  No one cleared my table or even spoke to me though there were people doing that at other tables.  The frozen desert, chocolate, had no taste at all.  It was cold, creamy and without any flavoring.  The lady at the registered dropped 2 large stacks of glasses (all glasses are plastic or paper).  She and others picked them up from the floor and stacked them back up.  I watched as they gave them to the new customers.  What do you think would be on a floor? There is always lots of food but they obviously care nothing about food temperatures or bacteria on their dishes. I will not be returning."
5,"It took a little to convince me to start using a salon for my hair, but based on my experience with Serenity Salon & Day Spa for over five years, I haven't looked back.  The owner is incredibly dedicated to making sure her staff is professional, her services are high quality, and her customer's are satisfied.  I work with a lot of small businesses, and this place does it right.  I have recommended this salon to many family and friends, and now my mom even drives over from the west side of Madison she is so pleased.  Finally, the costs are very reasonable in comparison to similar quality salons, and in fact, I think you get more for your money here."
1,"I took two of my friends there who are here in Phoenix the first time and the service was terrible.  The noodles and other dishes were good as usual, but the service we received from the guy was otherwise.

That guy talked very fast which didn't bother me as much until he started forgetting our requests.  He stopped by to check if we needed to refill the green tea in couple of occassions but never did it until in much later time.  When we asked to split the bills in two in certain way, it had to be done three times.  It just gave me the impression that he didn't really pay attention to what we wanted.

This is the first time I went back since last year (rated 4/5 previously).  Hopefully he will improve his service and attitude or else they will lose more customers."
5,"best eggs benidict in the area from the traditional to salmon ,crabcakes even vegitarian version  tenderloin special all excellent do a great job on
 all breakfast from omletes to skilets to eggs corned beef hash pancakes only had lunch here once very good burger and club sandwich kids love watching the planes come and go always have had excellent service excellent food at reasonable prices can't go wrong"
1,I retract my last positive review. I had a reciever repaired here.The equipment they installed failed 5 days after the product guarantee. They wouldl not even give me a break in the diagnostic fee of 20.00 to have it looked at again. They told me it would be about another 150.00 to fix it again.  I would stay far away from these guys.
1,"Arriba has been one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix, but tonight I have really had to examine my love of this restaurant. It has been at least 6 months since I ate there and I was really excited about going back. I was seated in the back room. I immediately noticed that it looked like it needed a deep cleaning. My table was clean, but the walls and the areas surrounding the cheesy nature scenes in the back were filthy. The service was good, and my meal came quickly. As I was eating, something caught my eye not far from my table in the nature scene plants. It was a set mousetrap. This really turned my stomach. The food that I was eating was great as usual, but it really creeped me out that the place was so dirty and that they apparently had a rodent problem. My advice to the owners is to bring in a professional cleaning team and for heaven's sake don't leave mousetraps out for the patrons to see."
1,"BEWARE!!  Don't park your car here while traveling.
We returned from 10 trip. Loaded car and started engine. Loud exhaust noise. Car catalyst vandalized (cut out) in parking lot that supposedly has security. The only security person we saw was on the day we returned and he was hanging out in the lobby. Hotel staff and bus driver said this has happened numerous times. General manager provided me with their insurance info as a way to get me out of the lobby knowing that their insurance company was not going to cover vandalism damage to our car. $2200.00 later, car is fixed. Situation was handled very poorly by Hampton Inn management."
5,"Love the drive-through concept (SO much better than Starbucks or McD's!), the coffee, the smoothies and the stickers!  I have a little collection of them.  The staff are always super friendly and patient while I'm making up my indecisive Libra mind.

Edit: they were also extremely accommodating when I picked up coffee there with two vegan friends.  They have a lot of non-dairy, soy-based stuff for the vegans and lactose intolerant among us!  Just one  more reason to love this place."
1,"We were guests there once in about 2003 for one of the morning services.  We are used to megachurches with lots of praise and worship and messages where many Bible passages are referred to and explained with practical, applicable and content-rich teaching and even some humor.  We are used to churches that are ALIVE.  I felt like I was at someone's funeral.  I didn't feel the Holy Spirit there at all.  In fact, I felt really strange like I couldn't wait to leave not only the church but the grounds.  The greeters smiled a lot; I'm sure some of them weren't fake."
5,"This is a great place if you're looking to enhance skills in Microsoft Office, Photoshop, etc. My consultant is Nick and he's very friendly, helpful, and accessible."
1,"I've been selling at Buffalo for several years now, and while sometimes I walk away with a pocket of cash and others not so much, I've learned how to judge pretty well what they're looking for (seasonal items, condition, etc). 

After a good closet cleaning, I decided to bring a couple of bags of what I thought worthy down to BE. Let's see, after scrutinizing most pieces for a good 2 minutes, asking other sales associates to look things over, etc, I was able to sell five items - three with tags still attached. Guess how much ""cash"" they offered me? TEN DOLLARS. Ten dollars for FIVE items. Ten dollars for 2 dresses, 2 new tops, and 1 new belt. Are you freaking kidding me? What a rip! That means, if ten dollars is 35% of the trade, all five items will retail for a total combined cost of what, less than $35? What a total scam. Silly me was so shocked I just took my joke of a trade and left, but now I'm kicking myself for not demanding an itemized receipt to see what my items will ""really"" retail (cause they sure as hell won't only cost a combined $35).

Also, I brought in this gorgeous yellow 100% silk dress purchased at Anthro for over $100, and they said that if I dry cleaned it and brought it back (to remove 2 TINY spots on the bottom hem of the dress) they would purchase it from me - for SEVEN DOLLARS. So I'll spend $8 to dry clean it and then sell it for $7? Silly me but that just doesn't seem to add up. 

Seriously, Buffalo, stop ripping people off. You just look like a jerk. 

People, if you're not worried so much about the money aspect and are just looking for a change in wardrobe, organize a Frock Swap with a huge group of friends. You're bound to find way cooler items for no cost at all, and it's super fun to boot. Or, if you are worried about money, consign with other shops (for example, My Sister's Closet), but sure as hell don't do business here."
5,"Great little place!  Service is friendly, food is great.  The pizza here, while not the same as Chicago, is probably the best in Madison.

We just had our 4 year old's birthday party here, wanting to support a local place with decent food rather than a Chuck E. Cheese. We were astounded at what a nice job they did for our daughter. They were so accommodating with everything, even assigning a member of the staff to our small party. The kids had a wonderful time. Absolutely thrilled."
5,"Wow. I've been reading the other reviews and I'm honestly shocked.  I've been coming here since it first opened and no one knew anything about it.  I liked it better when it was small and unknown, but that's because I could enjoy it at my leisure.  The owner would often come out and chat up the customers and the business in a house was a fairly new phenomenon.

The food has been consistently tasty and fairly priced. The only thing to change over the years is the architecture and decor.  I've taken all sorts of people here to eat and no one has ever disagreed that it was the best Chinese food.

I have always had at least adequate service on First Fridays.  The rest of the time, the service is as wonderful as the food."
1,"While driving home last night, we decided to drive up 7th St and look for a Mexican restaurant.   Sadly, we found Jordan's.  The outside looks very nice.  Once inside, it's obvious this place hasn't been updated since 1981- lots of dark, heavy wood & wrought iron. NICE! I loved it. REALLY!  I loved it enough to overlook the amazingly creepy carpeting figuring if they updated the carpeting, they'd have to update the rest of the decor, too.  We were blown-away, in a really, really bad way, when the chips & salsa came...as noted by others, it tastes like ketchup with some chili powder mixed in. Horrible. We already ordered drinks & didn't want to split and stiff our waitress so we ordered a cheese crisp.  The cheese crisp was fine.  Sadly, we didn't have any salsa to put on it.

Other reviewers pointed out that aside from salsa, it was a good experience.  Whatever.  I suppose these same folks would be fine with a blind date who arrived in dirty clothing & who hadn't showered in a week.   If a Mexican restaurant can't do a decent salsa, they don't get a 2nd chance."
1,"Wow- I honestly cannot believe what happened to me at this place. I purchased 2 bikes and 2 locks about 3 weeks earlier, and the gentleman who helped me then was great. About 2 weeks later, one of the tumblers in the lock fell apart. I took the lock back in, with the receipt, and the owner (?) basically said that the lock must have been tampered with, and he wouldn't let me exchange a $20 lock after spending over $800.....really? He was basically calling me a liar, and when I tried to explain that it would be good customer service to exchange the crappy lock, he stepped up really close in my face, and said ""don't tell me about customer service!"" Wow! Obviously someone needs to tell him because he hasn't got a clue. He could not have handled the situation worse than he did. There are so many great bike shops in Phoenix that thankfully I will never have to support those thugs ever again. I would suggest that, unless you like buying defective merchandise with no exchanges allowed, to avoid this place and support local establishments who actually care about their customers."
5,5 stars for the drunk females and 1 star for the place being so small! lol ;p It's 21 and over on the second floor and below it's 18+ they don't serve alcohol at the bottom.
5,"As Gabi likes to regularly point out to me, I did move over a year ago and I am closer to Cheuvront.  I suppose it is time for an update.

My initial review of 5 stars has not changed.  Not every visit to Cheuvront has been a 5 star visit, but over time I have come to know what dishes and wines that I prefer.   I am a frequent visitor to Cheuvront because I like the atmosphere it provides within the downtown area and it takes less than 5 minutes for me to walk there.  It provides a relaxed environment where you can enjoy wine or a cocktail and order food based upon how what you are in the mood for.  A full dinner? Sure.  Just dessert? You got it.  A small nosh? Why not.   I find myself here most often for small plates and cheese, very rarely do I have a ""regular"" entree.  It is not to say that they aren't good, they are and they are quite large, I just enjoy the variety of the menu.  

My favorite time of year at Cheuvront is the fall, as I think that their best dishes involve traditional fall ingredients such as butter nut squash and pumpkin.  This is also my favorite time to partake in their extensive cheese list.  Their international plates, while may seem expensive at first glance, are literally overflowing with cheese and meats.  Happy Hour can be a fun time, although I am personally not a fan of many of the mixed cocktails that they feature.  This works out just fine, as the wine list has many choices that I am happy to order at 25% off.  The $5 tapas offered during HH are great compliments, my favorites being the gnocchi, ceviche, and the mac and cheese.  (Really, any of their mac and cheese options are great). 

The relaxed atmosphere and consistent food and service have made Cheuvront into one of my favorite places in Phoenix, and possibly my favorite place downtown."
5,"i am really happy right now, cause i just had round 2 of my wrap from that's a wrap!

but...Wow, i didn't realize how lucky i was to beat the lunchtime crowd here. I have been meaning to go here for several months, but like our first reviewer, can't go out of my way when during their normal biz hours.

but, i had heard so much about it, i like green so much that i jumped at the chance to stop by after a rare 10 a.m. downtown meeting. i got there at about 11:30 and there was plenty of parking (by plenty i mean only three of the lots 10 or so spots were occupied), but, even though i knew what the building looked like from driving past its closed doors so many times before, i still cruised right on past while heading south on 7th st. i went into the second entrance to the lot that wraps behind the building and oops! that's an exit only. i had to do some fancy manuevering and a 3-point-turn (haven't lost my skills since driving test '98 - woot!) to face the right way and get into a spot.

normally, i would be pretty annoyed at all this, but i was too excited to try a refreshing vegetable-heavy wrap on such a damn hot day. and that's a wrap! did not disappoint. while i waited for my companion, i looked over the menu and was surprised at how many of the items were hot or grilled. i was kind of heartbroken until i saw the daily special, chicken salad with avocado, lettuce, veggie mayo in a flavored wrap (all the tortillas are flavored, making the choosing process that much more painstaking).

once i had my order on lockdown, i checked out the art on the walls of this early 1900's house-turned cafe. not my taste (the subjects were robotic kind of monsters with drippy limbs, i thought of pink floyd the wall, while my friend likened it to what a 15 yr old metal head stoner doodles during class) although they had skateboard art, also, which was better. then i picked up a java magazine and flipped through it...basically, if you come alone, you won't look like a loser, there's plenty to keep you busy.

blah blah blah - long story short, the wrap was great, although on sides menu i chose ""house chips"" thinking they would homemade potato chips, but were just store bought tortilla chips. lame. friend got the pasta salad which was much better, i recommend that. plus, they cut the burrito sandwich in half and have bags and plastic wrap right there at the drink station, so you can easily get two meals (hence my being happy at round #2) and i was happy i didn't have to 
 a. wait in line forever just to get my wrap travel-appropriate 
 or 
b. feel like a jerk and cut in front of everyone just to get my wrap travel-appropriate

now, i am sad because i probably won't be back for another couple months, but only because it's not closer."
1,"Came in to the store and no one greeted me even though there were 5 employees on at 8 am. Ordered a venti iced coffee with 2 pumps white mocha instead of the regular pumps of classic and they charged me for a full set of pumps (.60) when I asked why I was being charged, very coldly and dignified, the barista told me it is corporate policy... I responded with I know corporate, I was a partner for 6 years. Personally, I would never have charged for the white mocha seeing that I was not getting the full pumps and I was not getting the classic syrup. Never coming to this one again. I much prefer the stores closer to my house. At my store we made sure to greet every guest when they came in and tried to make a connection with everyone who ordered a drink. If this is the same regional manager as other Starbucks I've been to then they need to know he is not doing a good job. A lot of stores are not gold standard."
5,"Great place in Heritage Square for a relaxing glass of wine!  I have been coming here for 8 years and have always been impressed.  They have a nice selection of beer and wine and it is reasonably priced.  The old house it resides in is very nice.  I love the wordwork and the built in cabinets.  I liked it better when there were more sofas and less tables/chairs, but I guess it is so popular and they are trying to fit more people in there.  Great place to spend some time while waiting for your table next door at Pizzeria Bianco!"
1,"A friend suggested that I begin my bike search here. Boy was he wrong. Maybe the West Wash location has better customer service, but after standing around bikes for 10 minutes without so much as a ""hello"" or ""can I help you?"" I took my business elsewhere - I ended up spending $2K+. 

My suggestion: Madison has great bike shops so don't waste your time at this place."
1,"I wasn't even going to give one star, but the Mac&Cheese was amazing.
As for the staff, my suggestion is to get rid of the entire staff that is presently employed there, and rehire all new people. Start over.
You would think that with a name like Alice Cooper behind you, that the team would be amazing and go out of their way to have pride in their establishment and offer a good experience. We went here before a RUSH concert in November, and it was absolutely the worst customer service we have all four ever experienced.... And we are from Tucson, and were so excited to stop for drinks and dinner before our show.
The guy waiting on us was very impatient, and very huffy. Complaining about the busyness.  And at the table next to us, their waitress complained to her customers that ""she was very busy, and would get them what they needed when she could"", while raising her voice about three levels.
Horrible experience."
5,"Today I decided to stop by one of my regular favorites. 
Of course I had to rate it 5+ stars, it's been an excellent trip every time I've stopped by, and enjoyed some of the best Mexican food I've had.
La Tolteca, is an all in one stop for what you need food wise. They have a small grocery section, to where you can even get yourself a 40-quart tamale steamer, obviously you can use it for other uses as well. They sell masa, and anything else you would need to make your own dishes at home. 
They have an extensive bakery with fresh baked goods that they are continuously bringing fresh baked goods out. They make cakes, flan, tres leches, and many other delicious desserts, and can customize an order for you and make you anything you'd like. They even have samples available, and of course I'm one of those guys who goes hog wild on samples :)
They have a meat section too, to where you can get 1/4-whole chickens, ribs, and other meats. They make fresh guacamole, queso fresco, and many other delights.
Their food selection is huge, and it would take me awhile just to try everything from the 5lb super torta, he super burrito, soups, breakfast items, and many other foods.
They even cater!
Today I had my usual, three mini cabeza tacos, refried beans, and horchata.
Their cabeza is the best I've had. It's juicy, crisp, flavorful, and not greasy in one bit unlike most places that make cabeza.
The beans were delicious and moist. They weren't dried out of pasty like you may find at some quick stop Mexican restaurants or chains.
Horchata is great no matter where you go.
Prices are inexpensive no matter what you get, and for someone on a budget like myself, it's a great deal. You can fill yourself up on food and not break the bank.
I highly recommend stopping here and trying something new, it's not some Taco Bell so don't come in here expecting some Americanized garbage. This is the real deal.
I know for one, I will be back, maybe to try something new, or to have some more delicious cabeza."
5,"My work uses Enterprise and I was very pleased. The pricing is not bad, considering we are under a corporate account.

The first time I rented a 12 passenger van, the two employees seemed overworked and stressed (must be a Friday afternoon thing!). And to top it off, the previous customer with the van I needed had not returned and I needed a van. Despite all of the craziness, the employees were kind to me and did everything in their power to find me another van, including working late to wait until this was taken care of. I appreciated their efforts.

The second time around everything was peachy and everyone was so friendly that my anxiety of having to drive a large group in a big van to Chicago diminished :-)"
1,"This place has the oiliest food I've ever eaten in my life.  I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil.  I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach.  I wish I could've washed the other dish too (but it wasn't one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish).

Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too.

Really not sure what the fuss is about."
5,"I've been eating pizza from Buck's for over 20 years now. And it's still that damn good!

As Timothy pointed out, they don't waste their effort on promoting an image. Instead, they are all about their pizza.

They made me a fan of the square cut. Who really wants a large ring or dry crust on the outside of their pizza anyway? It's just unused landscape for toppings.

I have yet to have a better thin crust anywhere in Wisconsin.  This place is well worth a trip for some carry-out."
1,"I went to a best buy in Tempe and was very pleased with the service. This store however has been terrible. The service is slow with long lines and miscommunication between fellow co-workers, as well as with me resulted in a huge amount of my time wasted. Don't bother trying these guys unless you enjoy being angry and computer-less.t"
5,"Crave Sandwich Cafe is almost a daily addiction for me. It's close to the office but it's the food that keeps me coming back. Their specialty are sandwiches but everything on the menu is good and FRESH, and prepared by a friendly staff just to your liking."
1,"Oh. My. God.

One would think that any restaurant in America's Dairyland, especially a chain restaurant that has been around for decades, could serve breakfast without screwing it up.

Our family of three ordered breakfast for dinner tonight and this Perkins disappointed the heck out of us.

One order was steak and eggs: the steak was supposed to be medium and the eggs over hard. What came to the table was a bloody, raw steak -- not rare, mind you, but raw -- and eggs with a translucent, inedible crust around the outer edge.

Some of that crust ended up in one of the other orders, which was scrambled eggs with biscuits and gravy. One does not expect the possibility of breaking a tooth when eating scrambled eggs, but not one, not two, but three two-inch long pieces of that translucent crust ended up in the folded, dry ""scrambled eggs.""

Another order of scrambled eggs -- mine -- had a long, thin, hair-like thread of indeterminate origin. Was it the same substance as the translucent crust? Was it a string from a hairnet? Was it a human hair? When I pulled it from my mouth, it split in two and curled up like elastic might curl up.

Our server was appropriately apologetic and tried to make things okay -- the service was good, but the food was absolutely horrid!

The manager asked us how our dinner was when we went to pay, so we told her. She took 20% off of our bill but, truly, the food we ate was overpriced at any discount. If we all hadn't been so darn hungry and tired, we'd have left without eating. And if I had it to do over, I would have insisted we all leave after finding the inedible translucent hard gluey stuff in the eggs and find somewhere else to go.

Do NOT repeat our mistake. AVOID this restaurant. Try the IHOP down the road if you want breakfast. Go across the interstate to Texas Roadhouse if you want a steak. Go hungry if you must, just don't eat here. Please."
5,Best Mexican grocery store I have been to in a long time. Can't beat the produce prices or the fresh food they sell. I eat everytime I go then shop. Amazing
1,Personally if I am shopping somewhere as high end as Saks Fifth Avenue where they cater to a higher end clientele I think I deserve good customer service. I came by here today to return a shirt that I had bought recently and received major attitude by the gentleman who helped me. He treated me as though I was an inconvenience to him. I then proceeded to go upstairs to purchase some jeans and the sales guy was rude and made me feel the same way! Horrible and seriously unacceptable and I don't plan on shopping here in the future and you shouldn't either.
1,"Worst hotel ever for this ""level."" Upon check in the elevator door wouldn't close, after 4 attempts we used the stairs. We get to our room and the key doesn't work. The front desk gave us the wrong room key. It actually opened another room. Lucky we aren't thieves..."" The TV did NOT work so we went without. There is nothing like crud in the corners of the bathroom floor from a lazy mop job over many weeks (obviously) for that kind of build up. Gross overall. 

If you are looking for somewhere within walking distance to Chase Field, we did not find it threatening to walk in that area. Late at night, after a game, there are a lot of people and vehicles around. Those reasons are why it seemed OK for the area. I must say however in 104 degrees it is a lot more of a walk than you think. Had we known parking is cheap (under 10 bucks for some GREAT parking) we would have stayed FARTHER out at a Hilton..."
5,"This place was a lot of fun to bring the kids. When we got there, the wait was pretty short, my husband requested a seat in the train, so we walked around the lobby while our table was being prepared. I'm glad we had the time to stroll around, all the creepy old rooms were awesome. The PacMan game is a great touch.

As we approached the table, my 5 year old's smile stretched from to ear at the sight of walking up those train car stairs. Our server was prompt and courteous. Our food was good, I had the cheese ravioli, the kids had some spaghetti, and my husband had the chicken Marsala. But  I'm not a foodie, so this is not about the food. It was about the ambiance. Which was fantastic. The food was good enough to not lose any stars because of it. 

The refills were on point. The only negative was that all of the tables around us were dirty. But I think that's because the train is too small to have a busser in there while customers are there. It, at the very least, would be a tight fit with the possibility of him bumping in to us.

The check was small. Love that. It's a very affordable restaurant.

Next time we come, we're riding the tram and sitting at the bar. I forgot how cool this place was. We were glad the kids had a weird spaghetti craving that night."
1,"Since the BF moved to Phoenix last fall, I've been taking him on an informal tour of old school Phoenix eateries.  As part of our vintage dining tour, we finally make it to Katz Delicatessen & Sandwich Shop.  It definitely has an old school feel right down to the vintage diner interior.

The food was fine.  The bagels and cream cheese were good, but not outstanding.  Our lunches were serviceable, but forgettable.  It was amusing to watch the antics of the staff that outnumbered the diners at lunch by nearly 3:1.  With so many people out front, it appeared that there was only one short order cook and our food took way too long for simple deli offerings.

The real negative for me was the restroom.  I'm not expecting a marble shrine like the men's room at the Ritz-Carlton, but I want the rest room at a place that serves food to be clean and somewhat up to date.  The men's room at Katz was on par with some gas station restrooms that I have been unfortunate enough to see.  We're talking totally gross El Bano del Diablo here.  The dining room itself also needs a thorough cleaning, but the restroom was totally off-putting for me."
5,"I've been to many restaurants in Middleton, but this is by far my favorite, and for a number of reasons. The food was excellent: I had a scallop and shrimp special. The service was excellent: Seated promptly, waitress prompt, professional and spoke very clearly when it came to the specials. The atmosphere is unique: In the basement of a building, but you wouldn't think so when you're there. Piano player, Great Martini! So when you're in Middleton, I suggest you stop here! (And Marnie is correct on the raspberry vinaigrette dressing with actual raspberries in it!!)"
5,"Good price, super fresh food, very efficient staff (though I could get my food faster) considering there's almost always a few people ahead of you if not 10. I usually have greasy (tasty!) mexican food but these guys know how to give you something good and healthy so definitely recommend trying them out."
1,"I took my Bassett hound in on Wednesday 11/7/12 she has something wrong with her left eye looked greyish. They did no testing and gave her drops for possibly being bitten, by Saturday morning the eye was almost completely grey and I took her back the doctor came in didn't even look into her eyes and said it has to be Valley Fever and needed to do blood work but started treatment on Saturday and would call when the results came in. She acted like I was wasting her time by asking questions about Valley Fever. I just moved to Arizona and had never heard of it. So we did blood work and more medicine and off we go. By Tuesday afternoon I get the call saying quit giving her the pills for Valley Fever and take her to the Eye dr for animals it must be glaucoma and they can't help. So, after $300.00 with them and another $300.00 for the eye dr YES she does have glaucoma and is blind in the eye  I believe they possibly could have saved her sight if she had been diagnosis properly"
5,"Love the Modified!
i have been coming here since i was a wee freshman in highschool!
one of my favorite venues in phoenix, gets crowded and loud stinky and awesome in a hurry, or it can be empty pensive and introvertedly artsy! just depends i suppose. I cant wait to be back, check out their events calendar on their website for gallery shows or concerts or film viewings. love you modified see you this friday hopefully?"
1,"I had an unbelievable experience yesterday. I went to Vin Santo hoping to order some food to go. Upon brief greeting the owner informed us that they ""don't do takeout on the weekend"". This is astonishing and something that has never happened to me before.  I am a foodie an have dined on 5 different continents, including Michelin rated restaurants. Shocked, we went to Villa Dolce where the owner was very accommodating to our take out request. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. Your loss Vin Santo. We are never coming back."
5,"Crazy good food, excellent wine list, text book waitstaff. Best atmosphere for date night!  Not good for kids. Make a reservation!!"
1,"Got excited about trying this place. We're not big on Pizza but there are other entrees...  not many but some. We figured, well, not a huge selection but maybe they do those few things really great!!  NOOOOOOOOOO.... not the case. I can't say about the pizza... but, we started with a side salad which was excellent - I had such high hopes for dinner!  Shortly there after we received our  Bruschetta Authentico (hmmm... reverse order)...  these was a huge plate of bread and the bruschetta mix. It was bland & tasteless and way too oily.  I live for bruschetta when I go to Italian Restaurants but skip this in the future - we even reread the descriptions a number of times trying to figure out why it was so horrible..... tomatoes were not rip for starters but the spices were just not right.  

Now enter what they call Italian Flag Lasagna. It was simply the worst Lasagna we ever had. My dinner companion loves Lasagna and rarely complains about anything. He stopped eating it and pushed it aside as well and I had to ask him if his was as bad as mine was.  We both got it and neither of us could literally ""choke it down."" The noodles were mush and the entire Lasagna had been obviously pre-cooked and microwaved. Costco frozen lasagna is better than this sorry excuse for an entree.  We basically asked the ""manager"" if anyone was looking at the items coming out of the kitchen because it simply shouldn't have been served. While they did not charge us for these items it is a sad state of affairs when an Italian place can't figure out lasagna.

We decided to strike Oregano's from our dinner list...."
1,"Horrible! It wasn't even busy and it took the waitress 15 minutes to come to our table when we arrived. Meanwhile, she was standing at the counter playing on her iPhone. The food was the worst and we have eaten at different streets of ny before and loved their food. Bread was stale, salad wasn't fresh, pizza was just ok. The manager stood next to the bar the entire time playing on his phone. I never plan to visit this location again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"
1,"I was a fan of this place 10 years ago and moved out of state. I recently moved back and was excited to take my partner and out of town guests to this eatery!  It was awful, long wait, skimpy sandwich, loud music on patio, so loud and somewhat abrasive when the singer talked to the audience. I couldn't hear or talk to the person sitting right next to me.   This was the 29th and a Sunday brunch.  Disappointed, will not go back, especially since there are so many new and fantastic eateries in Phoenix!  You can't rely on a name, Duck and Decanter, your poor service, etc will catch up and you will not survive.  My advice to all who ask,  where is a good place to eat, I will say not Duck and Decanter!"
1,"This was, quite possibly, the WORST Chinese food (if you can call it that) that I've ever eaten in my life.

We started with the appetizer platter for two.  The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth.  The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.

Then came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.

My boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.

Apart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  

Plus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?

Skip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.  On Fridays, they receive shipments of Pork Bao in from a bakery in Chicago that are to die for!"
5,"I can't stand to sit here and read these horrible reviews. 
When my son was receiving treatments for spine/ brain cancer, at UW Hospital, we did not  have many choices at that time of where to stay during and between treatments. My son would become so ill from all the radiation plus chemo, and the radiation treatments were at two 6 hour intervals every day, So we couldn't venture far most days.
Altho we had spent time at the Ronald McDoanld house, after a time I needed to make my son feel less a patient and more like a celebrity for a day. So I decided to take a paycheck, and chose a day between visits to get a suite at the Marriott West. 
Altho my son had to use a mobile IV unit, and was scarred on his  head from radiation burns, this Marriott was most accomodating and incredible.
We had a gorgeous suite, exquistie room service and gracious attentions.
These attentions were NOT triggered by my sons illness, but sincerely born from true proffesionalism and great training. 
This is a beautiful establishment, and I personally cannot stand the voices of spoiled whiners on these previous reviews. 
This Marriott will hold dear to me always and is worthy of your travel time relaxing time, and most of all your needs no matter to what extent.
Stop being so ridiculously spoiled and realize. 
This Marriott is above average."
1,"Generic chain food, most of which is made from frozen out of a bag ingredients.  Don't waste your money or time.  TGI Friday's or Applebee's with a Caribbean theme."
5,"I just love everything about this place. The location, the outside seating, the vibe, the food ... everything.

The kitchen is very small. This vintage diner car was meant for one cook. So the two guys in there really have to hustle and work around each other. The food is top quality as well. My boyfriend and I split a PB&B Burger and the Bumblebee chicken sandwich on a biscuit. The chicken was probably my favorite, but it was impossible to eat like a lady. It's stacked so high that in order to get some in your mouth, you have to get some on your face. I gave up and just started stabbing at it with my fork. 

The best part of Welcome Diner is the atmosphere: twinkling lights, picnic style seating, and friendly staff. I'm not sure who was working this last Saturday night, but he was so friendly and knowledgeable. We had a good little conversation about the history of the diner car. 

This would be a great date place ... if that's something you're looking for. This is also a good place for a group of around 6 friends to take over a picnic table."
5,"This is a favorite spot for my wife and I. We try to hit up the welcome diner once a week! Seriously, you can't beat the neighborhood feel, the ambiance of the Valentine Diner, the quality of the food, and the purity of the food. We went here for breakfast the morning after our wedding because we couldn't think of anywhere else we'd rather eat!"
5,"Loved this quirky place! Between the 3 of us we ordered the grilled cheese on a biscuit, the Carol (BBQ pork) and the Big Jim (for especially hearty appetites.  The flavors were amazing! Loved the mustard BBQ sauce on my Carol.  Really wanted to try the Beignets but they were out f them already. Cest la vie...a reason to come back for sure."
1,"This was probably one of the worst mistakes I've ever undertaken, and I'm including that apartment in the ghetto I signed a lease for because it was ""quaint"" and multiple men I really shouldn't have given as much of a chance as I did.

Boyfriend and I thought we'd relive our childhood involving Pancho's from when we lived in North Phoenix and went to the one by Metrocenter. I had a birthday party at that one, and my party went to see Buffy the Vampire Slayer before eating (I'm talkin' Kristy Swanson here... yeah, totally super sweet). We both recalled fond memories of raising the little Mexican flag to get sopapillas.

Walking in, and seeing that margaritas are not served as they should be, it was the ultimate in regret. 

me: ""Let's just go to Arriba. They don't have margs here, and that's really the only reason I wanted Mexican.""
man: ""Oh, come on. Where's your sense of adventure? I think I'll have a beer. (seeing look of disappointment on my face) Ohhhhkay, do you want to go to Arriba?
me: (downtrodden) No, I guess we'll stay here.

We exit the line, $20 lighter, and find a seat. This place is filthy. The server, who calls me ""mija"" at least 18 times, I find delightful for the first time she says it. Then I hear her saying it to all of the other females at her tables. Cheating bitch. The extensive salsa line looks awesome, and I perk up a little, like, maybe this won't be so bad.

WRONG. WRONG. WRONG.

It WAS bad. Everything was bad. The half naked children screaming, the white people everywhere thinking this is the bees knees of Mexican cuisine... it all adds up to probably the worst dining experience I have ever had. We promptly went to Arriba and drank a marg very quickly to forget about the pain."
5,"This laundry mat is small but tidy and is never over-crowded. The owners are punctual, professional and I see them just about every time I do laundry, cleaning up and providing maintenance if needed. Some places you just can't beat; this is one of them. :-)"
5,"Me and my boyfriend just tried Welcome Diner the other night, we wanted to go to a place that both of us have never been too. It was an awesome choice! It may not look like much from the street but you definitely have to give it a try. 

We both had burgers and an appetizer and all the food was great and prepared well. It is nice to go to a place that focuses on buying local food and contributing the the community. 

I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone."
1,"If you like your mechanics covered in tattoos, with a huge chip on their shoulder, and brimming with self-loathing that they direct outwardly to their customers, then this place is for you!!"
5,"My food hasn't come yet but this place already gets five stars cuz I know it's gonna be delish. My mouth watering as I type and enjoy the live and quiet guitar playing really incredible classical stuff in the corner. This place is uber cute and gets beaucoups des points for personality. Tons of eye candy in this little euro cafe lookalike, I feel like I'm back in San Francisco. I sat at the copper bar and was waited on by a hipster type.  Really nice and laid back service, but not record speeds.  They serve loose tea in little mesh bags that hang over your cup with a bamboo stick....more points.  My turkey brie and cranberry chutney sandwich was out of this world and the brie and pesto app I tasted was also pretty tasty.  It's coined as a meditteranean place but I'd probably call it fusion food.  Too many gourmet flavors to be strictly med.  The best thing about this place is everything.  Ambience....my favorite type...food is inventive and flavorful.  Nuff said....I'm still craving that sandwich and my only regret about this place is not asking that guitarist what he was playing."
1,Yucky I didn't think the food was very tasteful and it was overpriced.
5,"I have been taking my vehicle's to this shop for the past 5 years. Before then I 
would float from shop to shop ......never satisfied with work or price, if work is
quality I can justify it with price, but if workmanship and price don't match up 
its frustrating. It is so hard to trust in these type of businesses especially when 
you are a women with no knowledge of anything to do with a vehicle, sometimes
you feel you are being taken advantage of. Since finding this shop, I hope they 
never ever close their business doors, because I am a forever customer. I will 
drive whatever distance I have to drive to get my vehicle here in their most 
capable hands. Their customer service is unsurpassed. They provide transportation
to and from your work or home. Their workmanship is excellent. They may not
be the cheapest in town, but if you haven't already learned this lesson by now,
you will ""You Get What You Pay For"" . Trust me.....This business will not disappoint!"
5,"This place rocked. We were a little hesitant at first to try it bit it worked out. The location is right smack dab in the middle of a residential area and the diner literally sticks out of a house or possibly used to be a house but the food was phenomenal. All the seating is outdoor with a walk up window to order. The staff and the food choices definitely had a little hipster vibe. The collard greens were freaking amazing and the rest of the food was up to par for sure. Only complaint probably is that the drinks were a bit on the pricy side, $3.50 for a tall can of Pabsts. All in all, I would definitely visit again and again."
5,"This place has the best old fashion donuts!! EVER!  Yes they are sweet, that is why I must like them ;)  I have tried many of their donuts and love them all.  Their buttermilk donuts are also very good, however they are very heavy.  Literally heavy and fried goodness, ha ha.  So if you like more the traditional lighter donuts go for the non-cake ones.

If you don't go here because you think the place looks ""sketchy"" that is too bad for you. . . .because you are probably missing out on a bunch of great places in Phoenix that aren't the ""Kierland Commons"" or  a chain.  BOO!    

Grab a dozen and bring them to the office and watch your coworkers scarf them down."
5,So good! Definitely going back.
1,"I paid $20 for a crappy car wash. When I went to get in my car, the floor mats still had leaves on them, I paid extra to wipe down the doors and inside of the car and there were still marks all over the back trunk area from my dogs. The windows weren't wiped down because the writing from the type of wash I was getting was still completely legible and lastly, the back window was still covered with nose marks. I definitely won't be going back."
5,Best BBQ in madison. The best night is Thursday. All you can eat chicken and ribs. Their coleslaw is the vinegar oil kind. Not creamy. I love it. Some of the staff has worked there for years - a nod to this awesome locally/family owned eatery.
5,"This is one of those places that you  feel welcome and relaxed as soon as you get there. I enjoy the food, the walnut burger was super different and interesting, and although I prefer the beef it was fun to try something different.
The rest of the food was as good as bar food gets, but the staff and general feel of the bar (I love the old school jukebox!) makes it 5 stars for me."
1,"Service was terrible! I will never return!!! We waited in the bar and were never greeted or spoken too. People walked in after us and were seated. Not sure what their structure is for seating, but they suck at it. I will not be back."
1,"I am surprised to see other reviewers rate it anymore than an one. I would have given it a zero if it was an option.  We went to the zoo with my family, as we are visiting the Scottsdale area, plopping a hefty $45, expecting to be blown away. I am not well versed in zoo's other than as a mom of two young kids only to find an endless walk to see no animals. This zoo/park reminded me of a deserted zoo- could it be the time of year (Dec)- I don't think so.  Yelpers!! Take your money elsewhere. Did I happen to tell you that I asked for a refund and got a flat out NO REFUNDS. They offered tickets for another day but if I did not see any animals in the park why would I travel again for the same sub par experience?? The two supervisors listened with their Starbucks in hand and had a lot of reasons why our experience was terrible. Not exactly what I expect from a business."
1,they are now CLOSED FOR BUSINESS! You have to go to the eastside one now if you want to have Rocky's.
5,"I live a couple blocks from this place and I would literally eat here every day if I could afford to.  Though I'd probably end up with a few extra pounds to go with my empty bank account.  But every day when they post their daily special up on their Facebook page, I just sit and drool over it.  I've eaten here a handful of times and everything is so freaking good.  Its comfort food at its best.  And the staff is super friendly and helpful.  They treat you like a regular even if its your first time.  I love the fact that they source all their ingredients from local farmers and purveyors.  I initially thought the prices were a bit on the high side, but once I realized just how well the locally sourced ingredients were prepared, I now feel like its a bargain.  And I also love that they are open until midnight every day (except Monday).  This is just the coolest little place to grab some great food, a good drink, and chill with really friendly people.  I hope this place is around for a very long time."
1,"Maybe it's me but to charge $360+ to locate a ""low voltage short"" in our Tempe Loft is way to expensive!  Mark, construction Supt,  was a nice enough guy to discount this bill.  The ""call back"" to then replace the fan motor, which might have been the real problem in the first place, by the ""tech"" showed a real lack of knowledge and experience.  The billing lady Milissa (really unpleasant person) kept calling us about bills that did not exists due to the fact that the Legacy Air billing office right hand did not know what the left hand was doing.  We eventually successfully replaced the compressor on this 5 year old unit by another company.  Overall a very difficult experience with Legacy Air. Do yourself a favor.  There are so other better choices.  Thanks for listening."
5,"You can order online (which I find a pain and never do) or go to the store directly. It's like a big warehouse that you wander through trying to find what you want. I do admit to being frustrated sometimes trying to find certain items. The staff is friendly. I never have any problems ordering from the phone and if something needs returned I've never had a problem. 

The nicest  thing about Ryan's is they have the BEST prices on pet products hands down that I have seen."
5,"+++Band on a Monday night
+++++Delicious wings
+++++$2.00 Beers
+++Magic Johnson's Shroomer Burger
+++++Cobb Salad

All the food here is amazing. Fun environment, great set-up. Really as good as it gets. It looks like they have great lunch specials too. I met my Dad and his flight crew here after they flew in from Chicago. They loved it! They met some friendly Aussies before I got there so it turned into a party.
I didn't try the big unit, but it was fun to hear the bell ring every time the waiter brought one out. Maybe next time. Great service- very fast."
1,"Taco Bell, Taco Bell, Taco hell how does your garden grow, with all the grease you serve in your food I just don't know!!  It seems taco bell through out my life goes through cycles of crapness to craptastic!  

So like 20 years ago, it was like you ordered taco bell you would get grease tacos with some lettuce and something that resembled cheese. 

Then like 10 years ago it was like ""Yo Quiro Taco Bell"" with that little annoying fucking Chihuahua which was OK Taco Bell was kind of hip and tasted craptastic, remember according to the movie Demolition Man with Sly all restaurants will eventually turn into Taco Bells...this thankfully will never happen. 

And once again Taco Bell is now crapness food that is similar  to Filberto's only good if you are somewhat drunk and nothing else is open. I told myself I would never go here again after gas prices got up to around 4 bucks and I went in to order two chicken soft taco supremes, and it was like 6 bucks for just the two of them, and I was like are you fn kidding me? They said they had to raise their prices due to the rising cost of fuel.

This is right about the time they came out with their value menu of you can get a tortilla filled with baby poop for 79 cents campaign, I recently made the mistake of hitting the drive thru one hungry drunk night and  remembered why I vowed never to go there again.

My check was like 10 bucks for what I think were 4 soft tacos and a large drink, they could have been something someone puked into a tortilla with some lettuce and some bile for that matter, I was sick for two days...literally.

 I will never go to this location again, except maybe to protest the poisoning of the people by a huge corporation...eat here at your own risk it could be your last meal."
1,"Not my first time here, definitely my last.

After clear request for hard eggs in benedict, 15 minutes goes by, eggs come out hard, but wrong benedict. PLEASE, just quickly scrape out beef and replace with fish, another 15 minutes goes by and monstrosity arrives. Clearly they re-did the muffin and fish, but same (now cold) hash browns, hollandaise (topped with a bit of new), same eggs (also cold). Complain, manager (hispanic lady) says, 'sorry, we tried'. I say the plate is an embarrasment, if you were going to take 15 minutes, you could have at least re-made whole plate. She insists they did, I ask how they managed to cut her hard eggs just like she did, layer new holly over old stuff, she insists they remade it.

Restaurants screw up. Turns out waitress entered wrong model of benny, despite pleading with her to be careful. The mistake is sloppily fixed, but takes 15 minutes and they can't bother to replace 75 cents worth of hash browns and eggs. 

Complain to the manager, all you get is a defiant 'sorry, we tried', and absolute BS they ""remade it all"". No discount, no nothing. They did correct the price of the wrong dish choice. Big deal.

5 and Diner is a diner, I don't expect 5 stars. But I don't like being lied to, particularly when the evidence is so obvious.

I've been to PV Mall location as well, same cheerful staff, same cooks who don't seem to give a crap. 

At best, hit and miss. I'll keep looking."
5,"Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, AND a great staff! Say whaaaaaaaaaat?!?!?  

I had a brief, but torrid affair with the grilled cheese, and that delicious SOB left me wanting more!  

I HIGHLY recommend this spot!!!"
1,"Very unprofessional and rude employees...I would not recommend coming here unless you want the most expensive car wash, an oil change, and your gas tank filled for $0.20/gallon more than Cobblestone Auto Spa. I politely cancelled my wash (due to the badgering for upgrades and oil change) and the woman did not remove the writing on my window, just wiped two streaks through it and made a few comments under her breath. They then asked me to park my truck across the street while I go inside and pay for the gas they pumped while we were talking, then I was asked to come find her outside and bring her the receipt. Even though this location is close it is far from convenient. ..two thumbs down."
5,"Excellent service and work.  I needed a rush job that was more work than it seemed, the dress I needed hemmed was voluminous and she did a beautiful job and I am wearing it out dancing tonight,  feeling like Ginger Rogers.   Thanks to Darlene.
If you ever need anything altered this woman is very talented, and professional.
Truly as good as it gets."
5,"Wonderful place to spend the afternoon - great place for kids to run around and enjoy the space.  I'm really not big on the educational component of the Gardens (I know, shame on me!) but I love the atmosphere and being around nature.  Great all year round..."
5,A little store on the north side of Madison with a lot of character. The employees make a real effort to get to know the customers and help them in any way possible. The best part is the kittens in the store are not kept in cages but roam the store.
5,"What a great place. The food is amazing, the portions are huge, and the atmosphere is friendly. I really enjoyed having the carol over fries, with slaw... yum."
1,"STAY AWAY AND FOR GOODNESS SAKE, DON'T TAKE YOUR CHILDREN!!!  My daughter was misdiagnosed and spent two years on a medication she didn't need!  Words cannot describe how angry I was when I found this out through a reputable allergist.  I suspect that they are receiving kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies, because we spent hundreds of dollars on equipment and medications (which they provided directly).  The staff is ambivalent at best, downright hostile at worst.  And don't get me started on the excessive costs and all the hassle with the insurance!"
5,"If Bar Bianco wasn't dominated by the presence of its immediate neighbor, with its giant international cache, then this bar would have the most outrageous ratings for a Valley bar.  It really doesn't get any more quaint than Bar Bianco, with their converted early-century brick house, hardwood floors, candlelit alcoves, and old-world porch.

Its great to see people just lounging without being in any sort of hurry to escape anywhere.  This is possibly the rarest sight in Arizona.  Moreover, there is a balance of young and old, spread throughout its interior foundations and its courtyard like a discharged honeybomb.  When you take a moment to realize the history behind the square, you sense that the mood probably hasn't changed very much in an entire century.  Being able to look to your acquaintances in closely neighboring restaurants and bars within Heritage Square gives a really cool sense of cultural and social community; this being the second rarest sight in Arizona.

Additionally, Bar Bianco makes it a habit to serve savory and rare-ish wines, my favorite being the locally produced Dos Cabezas Sangiovese.  The price of a bottle is pretty reasonable, although if you wait to order a bottle at The Restaurant, it is priced cheaper for some reason.  

Bar Bianco also used to serve Quilmes beer from Argentina, but apparently discontinued this practice.  

I've been here as both a subservient to Pizzeria Bianco, but also as a leisurely drinker respite from the binds of pizza, and I must say that its one of the most underrated drinking spots in the Valley."
1,"One liner:  Ick.

Even the heartiest of cravings for a DQ treat could not make us go here....simply nasty.  Dirty counters, messy machines, and dirty tables.  And super rude staff.

The ultimate kicker?  Walking in to find the nastiest dust pan sitting right on the counter where they place your food when it is ready.

Seriously...call the health department. We will drive all the way to Sun Prairie rather than ever step foot in this place again."
1,"Wish I had followed Jayd's advice and specifically requested Jackie. I felt a proposal from my long term boyfriend was eminent (I was right) and wanted to get my nails done since I (finally!) stopped biting mine. I was fairly pleased with the look of my French tip manicure for the first two days. However, my tech (can't remember her name) was really aggressive with cutting my cuticles even though I jerked my hands back, ""Oww!"". Now, not even a week later my polish is hideously chipping and I have little skin tags above my cuticles due to her roughness. In spite of this fabulous ring on my finger I shun at showing it to people because of my gross nails. And I was charged $17 for a natural nail French tip?! Locating my polish remover now and will NEVER return!"
1,"Ugh.  My tip-off should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good.  But I was craving Chinese, I work near the COFCO center, and it was threatening to rain.  I scanned the menu, found Kung Pao chicken, and ordered up.  They told me 5 minutes, and they were accurate.  Price was reasonable.  Waiting area was comfortable and well-decorated.  Food was inedible.   I got the lunch special, which include soup, egg roll, entree and fortune cookie.  I couldn't eat any of it.  The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour.  I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it.  I couldn't order the fried rice, because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma).  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.  I watch too many movies.  The egg roll was just gross.  It seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deep-fried.  The fortune cookie was stale, and the fortune was even lame.  I would've done better to get soaking wet and hit up Panda Express."
1,"Update November 2013

Had my Kindle STOLEN from their mailroom.  Amazon replaced it, but the office initially wasn't helpful in trying to find it, or admitting that it was even their fault.  In fact the property manager got snarky with me and stated they are not responsible for any lost or stolen mail.  Gee thanks, so I guess that means you can't help me look for it either.  As proof I offered up the fact that UPS had a signature on file for the delivery from the office manager.  I even called and talked to the guy who delivered it and he remembered dropping it off b/c it was one of those black Kindle boxes.  

After all was said and done they said they'd leave the door to the mail room close and lock it.  I went in this past weekend, saw the mail room door wide open with not a person in sight.  Again, it's impressive how incompetent these people are.

----------------
Initial review August 2013

They can't get their act together.  Moved in in May and there were many issues with the apartment (dishwasher had rusty wracks, ice maker didn't work, carpets were not properly cleaned, dryer timer didn't work, the disposal was broken, the garage door open was broken, etc.).  It took several rounds of complaining to even get them to come out and look and even more rounds of follow up to get them to complete it.  It's September and the ice maker is STILL broken.  It's incredible how terrible they are!  I am actually astounded they could be this bad at their jobs.  I am ticked off enough that I logged on to write a bad review and I am typically a very understand and sympathetic person, but this is ridiculous.  We were also welcomed to a nice ANT problem the day we moved in.  I had called several weeks before we moved in and asked them to spray for critters.  Obviously that never happened either.

I also didn't appreciate the fact that they list GARAGE space in their square footage stats.  Something they LIED (intentionally or no, they should know what the square footage is in their units... that makes them either liars or incompetent and you should not tolerate either) about to my wife before we leased it and didn't discover until after it was too late (I had to move in sight unseen because we relocated from across the country and my wife was the only one who could see it in person at the time).

I've also had to call the cops for a domestic disturbance for someone in the complex... you can't always help or predict that, but it's the first time I've ever had to do that and I lived in downtown Chicago for 6 years before I moved here.

My advice, spend your hard earned money elsewhere, this place is laughably terrible."
1,"Well, Armadillo Grill, I'm not a fan.

We came here on Wednesday night for an NBA playoff game after reading the reviews touting the great food and the plethora of TVs. I was disappointed with the food and really disappointed with the service. I won't be back. 

Our server clearly did not want to be there; she seemed annoyed that we were sat in her section. She didn't know the menu very well, and kept having to (unapologetically) leave the table to run our questions by the other staff.

My boyfriend had the stroganoff and I had a veggie burger. Both plates came out within 10 minutes, which always makes me a little nervous. His was sub par; he ate about 35% of it. The veggie burger was near the quality that I've come to expect from most restaurant vegetarian options. The bread was decent, and the patty was an unaltered Boca burger. Everything was just below average, except for the music, which was about average.

They played it at a decent volume (thank you), and was probably someone's itunes playlist of hits from the 90s. I'm okay with that.

They do have a decent amount of TVs (though nothing to swoon about in my opinion), however they are small and outdated. Most of the ones near us were staticy. I ended up watching the game from a TV that was half way across the room, the only one in our section of the restaurant with a decent picture."
1,"Smaller sizes...not much for the plus or large crowd.  Also, the staff is almost incredulously rude everytime I'm in here!  I know people love it here, but it's like a very expensive Goodwill.  The clothes and accessories are way overpriced for what you're getting!  Save yourself some money and go down to the Goodwill at 16th St and Indian School.

Also, if you have clothes to sell, don't get your hopes up.  Gawd knows I've tried to figure out what they are looking for...when they did take a couple of my smaller size 12 sundresses to consign, they ended up giving them away to a thrift store for dogs (I shit you not) and didn't even bother to call me.  I guess that's not their policy...if you consign here and they don't sell your stuff in whatever time frame they think they should, don't expect to ever get it back."
5,"Update:  
After reading the talk thread on yelp about the welcome diner I am so happy that they are not closing!  Turns out they decided not to and now are going to open a second one in the not too distant future.

I am so sad that I came here on the last day that this little diner will be open.  I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine who is a regular patron.  It was a nice Saturday afternoon so we ate outside and I think the little diner (with 8 seats) was full.  I had a single patty cheeseburger and the favorite and a coke.  The favorite is fresh cut fries with peppers, onions and a few other things that made this a delicious side dish.  It was all soooo good... I am glad I had the opportunity to try it."
1,"I had to be admitted for a stomach infection. The 3-day stay was a living nightmare, and traumatic experience.

They rudely wake you up every day at 3am to do blood work. What sadistic monster would conceive of doing this to their patients at such ungodly hour? How completely unnecessary, and when I questioned the reason for the early rise, I only received non-answers and mean stares. 

Their solution to every problem is to give people a pill. And doctors are way too quick to prescribe them . You can't sleep, here's a pill. Well, if I wasn't interrupted 3-4 times a night I would be able to have a good night's sleep without the unnecessary assistance of a sleep hypnotic. 

Do you fell depressed in a hospital? Of course we all do. Here's a pill to you. Instead of treating your patients better, just fill them up with more pills.

Is your stomach hurting? Here's a pill. Of course it'll mask the pain but it will not make the cause of  your illness better. 

This is a teaching hospital that caters mostly to indigents and low-income patients. For people with insurance, such as myself, it was a horrific experience. By the way, I had a strange feeling I was a guinea pig for their students.

Your health is the most precious gift, beware of this hospital as they do not respect you as a human being. Some of the nurses are nice, but there were some that looked at you with extreme hatred. Their night RN supervisor reminded me of Nurse Ratched. She gave me the creeps.

Thankfully, I have only needed to stay in a hospital 3 times in my life. The first 2 times were for giving birth to my children in the late 1970's.  What I've learned from this current experience is that the state of medical care in this country has definitely declined to shocking lows.   

When I asked for a doctor's note to give to my employer, they were curt, dismissive and vengefully would not provide me with one. 

Banner Good Samaritan is by far one of the worst experiences I've had in my life. It has left me shaken to the core."
5,"Yum - I love Louisianne's. A bit fancy for every day, but the food is fantastic, the atmosphere in the restaurant is great and the service has always been good. Very delicious! I can't wait to go back!"
1,"My friend and I pulled into the shopping complex and decided to grab an iced tea at snoh, and then pickup a pizza at dominos. 

We parked in front of dominos (customer parking) but as we walked by our car, 2 employees started yelling and screaming at us. They were telling us not to park in front of the dominos because we weren't ""customers"". 

I told the female employee that we were going to grab a pizza to go, and she continued to yell at me like a psycho! 

This was completely uncalled for.  A company should not have employees that scream at customers. I will never go back to this location."
5,"""Respect"" Herberger Theater
Must see! It's a wonderful musical of a women's journey through life. The four women were absolutely wonderful. Good job girls!
There were four ladies in our group and we all loved it! Go see it, you'll be glad you did"
1,"They promised they would have my car fixed in under 30 days from massive hail damage.  Instead, they had it for 45 days.  I had to pay for two weeks of car rental out of pocket because they took so long, then it wasn't fixed right, and I finally had to have my insurance agent step in to force them to do the job right.  Very unprofessional, and I will never bring them my business again."
5,"Hands down the BEST BBQ IN MADISON! And yes, it was so good I had to use caps.

The ribs are smothered in delicious sauce and fall right off the bone. You can pick your sides. I would recommend the cole slaw and french fries. The cole slaw is nice and creamy. Mashed potatoes are another solid pick. Always get the ribs. You will be disappointed when your friends are gnawing away at their ribs and you have your little pulled pork sammie.

The checkered tablecloths and roll of paper towels on each table complete the experience."
1,"It's Christmas eve, 2012, and I am working the night shift in downtown phoenix. About 10:00 tonight I was driving into work on the 202. Out of nowhere a Yellow Cab came flying up behind me doing about 90 MPH and was inches from my rear bumber! The guy flew around me and proceeded to weave from lane to lane around the cars in front of me, using no signals, and continuing to drive about 90.

The phone number on the cab was 480-8888, license plate began with something like 47Z, and cab number (I believe) was 1152.

I immediately tried to catch up to him and call the number on the cab, however no matter what, I couldn't get through, as though it was non-existant number. He must have seen me on the phone and slowed down. I pulled up beside him and honked the horn, but he ignored me. He knew I was calling his boss. Luckily, I didn't see any passengers in his car.

I am not shaken easily while driving, but he came up on me so fast and was so close that I thought he was going to run me off the road.

They will NEVER get my business, and if I ever see anything like that again I'll be calling DPS, not his boss with the non-existant number."
5,"The atmosphere here is just so cool. Even if you don't like Alice cooper the rock and roll feel is all around. The staff wears Alice cooper-esque outfits and even the makeup! 

This is a huge restaurant and there was plenty of room to sit, mind you there wasn't a game on when we went. 

My friend and I both had the Marge Simpson Mac and cheese, it was heavenly. They put some tiny pieces of potato chips on top and it's just excellent.

The service was quick and friendly. I really enjoyed my time here. It's a great restaurant for families, couples or singles and looks like it would be a decent bar in the evenings. Sort of reminds me of the Hard Rock Cafe, but I like this place better."
1,"My husband and I was in az on vacation the week of 9/20
We visited this dump friday 9/21 for lunch . Well all I can tell you is shame on you. Firstly the food was horrible. My turkey sandwich was dry with no sauce on it, they forgot the avocado and when I finally received it , it was brown.  I let it go  but when my husband bit into his pulled chicken sandwich and almost choked on a 1  1/2 inch bone that was it for me. .. I said something to the waitress and the response was well it is chicken and they have bones and they  pull it off the bone . Are you freaking kidding me.. what the hell kind of response is that?  I am trying to find a way to contact Alice cooper himself because how can someone put their  name on such a disgrace of a establishment.  I would never ever let my restaurant get to that point. I suppose it's all about the mighty dollar. 
Also I kept the bone just in case."
5,"First I really like HRC in general, this one in particular is very nice, great location and love the decor (guitars in the ceiling, very cool). The service is great, very friendly and speedy. 
The food I really like, we had the chicken wings for starters, latter a salad and a bbq chicken that was a little under cook (but was promptly fixed by our server)."
5,"The desire to bring my mom here is damn near overwhelming.  Victorian antiques, kitschy decorations, and brocade wallpaper - and did i mention fantastic scones with Devonshire cream?  I'm not even a girly girl (look for me slurping Irish breakfast tea in a Dramarama t-shirt), but I just can't help feeling frilly and feminine in this place.  Spot on, my good man (translation: 'aw, hell yeah', for those less pasty)."
5,"Excellent customer service and very friendly staff

I started going to Los Olivos after I started working in downtown Phoenix. While I definitely agree that Los Olivos  takes longer than other car washes I've visited, however, Los Olivos is definitely worth the wait.  

Los Olivos is committed to giving the customer what they want, a great car wash at a reasonable price. Los Olivos is committed to making each customer happy and satified. Give Los Olivos a try you won't be disappointed."
1,"DONT USE YOUR CREDIT/DEBIT CARD!
Bartenders will tip them self after you leave Even if you already tip them with cash!"
1,"So I thought reading their menu, seeing it in Chinese language and in the 
Chinese District . . . it could be a real find -- I love dives with surprisingly good food.

 I was soooooo disappointed.

The egg drop soup was vegetable soup and just warm.  A minute after my soup
was served, my main course came out.  It had two items--pea pods and pork.  Not very BBQ flavor, rather a funny flavor.  No other veges such as water chestnuts or bamboo shoots.  The minimal sauce was very bland.  The rice was not fresh."
1,"The hotel was a little run down around the edges but I wouldn't complain about that - the price was competitive.  However, my husband woke up with some kind of bug bites.  We told the desk guy about it and all he said ""we don't have insects.""   This lack of interest in confirming or clearing up a serious problem was disconcerting.  We won't be staying there again."
1,"I like coming into this store.  It's clean and always has great selection and deals.  However, me and a friend of mine went late one night to shop and I ended up finding great deals.  So I spent about $50 that night.  I walked out and my friend asked what did I get.  Well I didn't have everything in the bags so I went back inside to get it from the cashier.  The first cashier or maybe she was a manager saw me and I told her I just walked out and noticed that I was missing items.  She basically accused me of not telling the truth, gave me a dirty look like I was a thief and really didn't want help.  So I made my way back to the cashier who also denied that she had the bag and again accused me of lying since I walked out.  I think they felt I would make a scene which I would've because I was telling the truth and plus they were going to be closing within 15 minutes and there was a line!  THEN giggling the cashier, she pulls the bag from the bottom shelf by her...she totally knew that she had it and she herself was lying. I have a feeling this isn't the first time they've tried this with people. So watch your bags!   And I've worked in retail, really lame employees and actions that night."
1,"Picked out our wood floor and amazing, from the time we picked out the floor until the next day's contract the floor price went up $3.00 a square foot.  Was told the factory had a price increase the day the measuring was done.
They sure don't know how to do business."
1,"I went to this salon in June for the first time. I went in to get a manicure and pedicure both with shellac polish. I had called to set up an appointment beforehand for my friend and I and I asked how much it would be for the shellac on both my hands and feet. The woman I talked to said $60. That's what I usually pay for the other place I go to but wanted to try this place out cause people said they did a good job. 
The day of our appointment we showed up and they started our hands first...they seated us away from each other when they knew we had come in together. So that bothered me right off the bat. I had gotten a design on one nail on each hand and the girl did a great job with the design and painting my nails. 
Then it was time for my pedicure, once again they sat my friend and I away from each other. We barely got a chance to talk because they sat people in between us too. The woman that gave me my pedicure did a great job painting my nails but a horrible job with everything else. The main reason I get pedicures is not for them to paint my nails (I can do that myself) I'm paying for them to scrub my feet, massage and whatever else to make my feet smooth. The woman scrubbed my feet for 5 minutes and that was it.  I was very disappointed. Especially when I saw that everyone else there had a lot more done then me. 
When I went up to pay the woman said the total was $80!! I told her I was told $60 then the woman said that I has gotten a design... My friends total came to $60 and she had gotten shellac on her hands but regular polish on her toes....so I paid $20 more for a small design and a bad pedicure. 
Later in the day my feet were already dry so it was like I never got a pedicure. I left that salon very disappointed and will never go back again. Or recommend it to anyone."
1,"Update: 8/26/12

8:30 A.M. Hangover. Ordered 2 Whoppers w/o cheese and 1 Whopper w/ cheese and 1 order of onion rings. Drive-thru. Had to pull ahead and wait. 21 minutes later, a woman in a purple velvet one piece delivered our food. Don't they have work uniforms here? Jeeez."
1,"Sorry to leave a bad review since these seem to be nice people, but my experience here wasn't good. I took in a high-end CD player that wasn't reading discs, and paid a $25 diagnostic fee. A couple days later the guy phones me and says the unit needs a new laser assembly, but he can't do it because he only has one of the two calibration discs required to do the job. He recommends I send it to the Sony facility in Laredo TX. I look at the reviews for the Sony facility and they're *horrid*. I decide to try one more thing, and contact an SACD ""modder"" I found through Audio Asylum. This guy says he can fix the unit, but he suggests I open it up and clean the pickup lenses before going through the trouble of shipping the unit to him. Long story short, the thing works like a champ now. I don't think I could trust DynaTronics to give me competent advice at this point, especially on audiophile gear. Sorry"
1,"I have to down vote this business for a terrible customer service experience. 

On a blazing hot Friday afternoon I left work early and drove all the way down to McDowell to pick up some toys for my dog. I walked up and saw the posted hours-- 4:30pm close, and my watch was just about at 4:30. I reached to open the door, unsure if it would be locked-- to my pleasant surprise, it was still open, I was so excited. The cashiers allowed me to head back to the warehouse-- again, I was relieved! I made a beeline for the toys and just a few feet before I reached them one of the workers pops out, literally stands in the middle of the aisle with his arms crossed (as if I were trying get backstage at a concert), and tells me the business is closed and that I had to leave. I told him that I just needed to grab a couple of toys, that I would need 2 minutes (under the circumstances, I would have been quick), but he wouldn't let me pass. When I politely persisted he asked me what toys I was interested in, and told me he would get them for me. I told him that I couldn't possibly know what they had in stock and that I just needed to visually see what they had (and how the heck do you describe some of these dog toys anyway??). No dice, he told me that I had to go. Really?? 

Inflexible, embarrassing, and a total wasted trip. I was steamed. Rather than ask for a manager when I was agitated, I decided to drive home and email customer service. They emailed back the following Monday and told me, essentially, the employee did was he was supposed to do, blaming it on concern for customer safety with all of the heavy equipment they utilize after hours in the warehouse. Mind you that I had been let in building, that nobody stopped me from entering the warehouse, that it had maybe just turned 4:30, that there were other customers there, that there was no heavy equipment in sight and that I had asked for 2 minutes. They were perfectly fine with their employee telling me that I had to leave, and they made no effort to keep a repeat customer.

Bummer, I was so excited to learn of Ryan's Pet Supplies a couple of years ago-- and indeed, they have a great selection at terrific prices, I considered it worth the burden of driving into a bad area with restricted hours. I had given them all of my business ever since. Now I will never go back again, and I will let everyone know that Ryan's Pet Supplies couldn't care less about their customers."
1,Great atmosphere.  Awful food.  Everyone looked like they were working hard to make everyone happy.  Except maybe the cooks.  The food was gross.  Good Ranch dressing and fries though.  Thank goodness.
5,"Soooo . . . As my child gets bigger and he goes from the size of a football to a boy who needs to jump into my arm for me to be able to lift and hold him, it crossed my mind perhaps he was now too old for the AZ Science Center. 

Glad to share that this is sooooo not the case!  My son is 7 now and just this week, I've taken him twice to partake in Snow Week where for the past week, they've special activities planned for each day. 

The two days I was there, there were tons of special activities on the daily schedule and these special activities were so well planned, my son and his friend enjoyed participating in them so much that both days, we spent minimal time on their permanent exhibits!!!!

Whoever was in charge (maybe it was a team?) of Snow Week did an absolutely thumbs up (both thumbs up in fact) fanta-excellent job!  Both my son and his friend enjoyed the science experiments on the first floor theater, the making of mini bobsleds out of giant spuds (Idaho potatoes) then racing the, down mini sled tracks, mini ice hockey (ice frozen on cookie sheet then min ice hickey sticks made from Popsicle sticks and pucks made from penny covered with electrical tape)- genius. My son and his friend played for almost an hour with this simple contraption!

Scented balloons were a big hit, as was making the gingerbread house. 

Aside from the special activities, my favorite section (see, and I'm a grown up- I think) LOL. Big kid at heart, that's me- is on the 2nd level where the kids can hands on learn about mechanical properties. All of us (including me) can spend hours there going from one hands on exhibit to the next. 

The permanent exhibits are an added bonus. Why do I say that?  Because they usually have a special exhibit or special activities planned that you can spend your whole day doing those!

I'm really looking forward to see what's next after Snow Week and now that I know how much fun Snow Week is from going this year, next year I will be taking my son for sure and plan on being there from open to close!!!!"
1,"Im not sure what the hell people are smoking before they come here to give this place anything more than a 0 star... I literally hated this place. I usually go to the one in Tempe, which is very nice.. Okay so this place blows... the staff is running around like animals not tending the guest and its just chaotic... so we start and the lane isnt work, its not starting the balls dont come back when we throw them and the gates are randomly coming down before we throw the ball, or before the ball hits the pins? WTF? The food is expensive... as expected since the others are.. but seriously we paid for unlimited bowling for 2 hours and stayed for like one hour. Also all the balls... well unless you have little kids thumbs, or giant hands, they wont fit the balls.. which in my opinion is like the # 1 thing when bowling... having a ball that fits... oh well. The lanes are oiled to hell and you feel like youll slip every time you go down to bowl.. thats awesome.. pay 15.00 to fit my fingers into smaller holes, break my neck while bowling, have the ball get blocked by a gate, and not get served? wow.. i know ill never go back to this one at least."
1,"I am 25 years old. I just moved to the area from Philadelphia and was looking for a OBGYN. I do not recommend Central Phoenix! My experience was terrible. The receptionist was very rude over the phone, but I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt because maybe she was having a bad day. After making my appointment I received a call a few days later that it needed to be rescheduled because the doctor was taking that day off. The lady on the phone was not apologetic about the inconvenience as I had already planned to take the day we had arranged off from work. I had an appointment scheduled at 5:30 pm however due to bad traffic I was running late. I called to let them know and no one answered so I left a message. When I arrived the receptionist at the desk was rude again and told me that because I was  little late the doctor could not see me. I tried to explain that when I called no one answered and she again was rude and unapologetic. I am currently looking for another OBGYN."
5,"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE! I've used the pharmacy (drive through at night) and store during the day and both were excellent experiences. By accident I left an item behind in the store after a purchase and the employees, especially the manager and assistant managers, were all VERY helpful in keeping it safe for me until I was able to retrieve it."
5,"Vin Santo rules!  

This is a great casual restaurant that is owned/operated a local couple.  She can often be found running the front of the house and he is in the kitchen.  Their passion is reflected in the quality of their food and the high level of service provided to their guests.

Their food is some of the best in the area - they focus on Northern Italian cusine.  It's simple, fresh, and delicious!  They always offer a variety of specials.  

The portions are huge!  You definitely feel like you are getting your money's worth.  I have never left without leftovers.  

My favorite dish is the Scampi Gabriella (jumbo shrimp sauteed with garlic, pancetta, and scallions finished with a white wine cream sauce served over linguini).  Awesome!!"

1,"Well I held out on writing a review based off my 1st experience,  which was two weeks ago.  I called in a order to carry out.  I ordered shrimp fettuccine Alfredo with fig and marscopone purchtuo burchettas. When I got home it was terrible.  The pasta is home made so it's super thick.  Four small shrimp and hardly no Alfredo sauce, I mean dry. That fake bruccetta is hard and dry.  So I called a spoke to Cindy and explained that I lived far from the location.  It practically took me an hour to get there and I couldn't come back.  So she put the owner in the phone and we worked out a deal that I would get a $27.00 credit the next time I came in. 

Fast forward to today which was a couple of weeks later. When I arrived Cindy wasn't there but the owner Richard was.  So I explained who I was and he remembered. So he said I can give you a $17.00 credit because you ate the meal didn't you?  I didn't even touch that dry mess. So being pressured and embarrassed of what the phone conversation was and what he was saying to my face and the place was packed and I didn't want to argue.  I just ordered their signature dish, the Osso buco to- go again. So the waiter rang me up and I ended up paying them about $15.00 additional dollars.  I was pissed off. But I figured well maybe it will be worth it.

I get home and make nice salads for me and my husband to accompany the meal still with high hopes because it looks good and the meat is falling off the bone. So we eat it with disappointment.  The sauce is tasteless I mean no flavor at all the bread was dry.

I will never return. I will go to Olive garden which I far better than this place. Or just wait to go back to New York and eat authentic Italian at Carmine's or Rao's in Vegas. Or for great bruccettas go to Postionos.

I don't know why this place is crowded.  The food is bland and it's so tiny.  I have been to several DDD destinations this one is a BIG miss."
1,"Our family went to celebrate a birthday with an Indian dinner - there were 6 of us in our happy group.  We have been going to the Maharaja for years, to enjoy the lunch buffets, Valentines Day, birthdays etc.  Tonight the food was good, but the service was an issue.

To start, we could see that the staff had changed.  The service took a long time, even though there were only 5 tables with customers and six wait staff.  The server did not understand English well enough to properly place the order, so there was extra wine for one person.  Also, the glassware and flatware were spotted, with some that needed to be sent back.

The service had really changed for the worse.  The server would clear one dirty plate, then wander off, return five minutes later to get another and so on.  The Manager or owner really needs to train the staff.  They were all working, but seemed unclear as to who was responsible for what duties.

We also ordered ice cream and a special birthday dessert, while very tasty - the service was vey slow, at least 10 minutes from the time the ice cream was ordered to served.

What really put us over the top was when they refused to accept their own $50 Gift Certificate that they sold to me in June towards the $160 bill (not including tip).  It had only been approximately 6 weeks. Apparently, this location has been sold.  The old owners still own the location on Odana Rd (same name), but not this one.  Therefore, they would not accept their own gift certificate and told us, we could use it at Odana Rd.  
Interestingly, they still kept the Best of Madison sign on the door for the old ownership,  they will need to take this down.    Again, we were surprised at the business decision about their own gift certificate."
1,"Played on 2/3/14.  Very poor conditions, both fairways & greens.  I would rate this as the worst course I have played in AZ.  Also the green fee of $85 is ridiculous.  Green fee does not include range balls, that were seemingly taken out of the desert & ponds.
Two thumbs down!"
5,"My heart goes out to Grand Avenue. Come alive. Please, please come alive. There are such great little spots sprinkled throughout and I think Paisley Violin is my favorite. I've been there a couple times. Once at night while there was a band there, which was cool. I felt kinda bummed that time cause I had no idea they didn't serve alcohol, but I did find out that they were byob. The band was cool. Food is good. Tea is good.

I went during the day recently and had a really good lunch and was able to have a really chill lunch meeting. Our waitor for lunch was super friendly, helpful, and had a good pulse on when to check in and when not to. 

The best part was afterwards we walked out back and the woman I was meeting with asked if I knew about the small houses/cottages out back. Apparently, they are cottages from the Japanese Internment Camps in California. And they were some of the larger ones for families. The man who had invested in the project (I guess the owner of Paisley came up with the idea and pitched it to this guy) led us around and told us about the space and how they were going to be renting them to artists. Kind of cool, I thought...cause in some ways incredibly dark and reminiscent of something horrible...but at the same time...a way to kind of capture and convert that energy and remind people of the atrocities that have been committed when motivated solely by fear rather than logic and reason."
5,"Great museum! A lot of info on native culture. If your visiting, this is a great place to visit and learn about the different tribes."
5,"Its Friday night...cold and snowing.   What  is there to do? Head to the Village Green.   Enjoy the Friday fish fry and yes, an ice cold beer.   So lets start with the service.   It was very good.   I walked in at 5:06pm, was immediatly greeted and placed my order within a few minutes.        By 5:10pm I had 3 pieces of hot cod, french fries, 2 hush puppies and coleslaw.   The meal was better then expected and exceeded expectations.   The Village Green is a traditional Wisconsin Tavern that has great service.   I am looking forward to next Friday already!   I forgot to mention that they have a decent selection of on tap beer.   I tried the Winter Skull, pretty smooth!"
5,"The ""ultimate mac & cheese"" really is the ultimate. I don't know how to make mac & cheese with caramelized onions in it yet, but I will learn, dammit, because I have seen the LIGHT. The accompanying grilled garlic bread was alright, but a little chewy for my taste - I'm more of a Texas-toast-crusty-garlic-bread kinda girl.

Also, be SURE you get something sweet. It might feel weird to order a donut or a shake with a savory lunch or dinner meal, but you can't leave without it. Just trust."
5,"I have been a fan of Wild Thaiger since 2006!! This is some of the most scrumptious thai food i have had hands down in the Phoenix area.  You HAVE to have the thai iced tea, peanut chicken, and the veggie rolls...yummmm.

The only negative is I recently went there on the weekend and the service was HORRIBLY slow because they only had one server for the whole restaurant, although small.  Im not sure if this was just an unusual day or what because during the week they are speedy.

Love this place!"
1,Snippy waitress. Ran out of bruschetta and caprece salad. Caesar salad was warm shredded lettuce (apparently including iceberg) and tomatoes with some sort of non garlic dressing that was barely able to be tasted. That is not a Caesar salad.  Flatbread came without being cut into manageable slices and crumbled all over the place. Was told the bruschetta would have been made on facacio ??? bread  if they had any. That is not bruschetta.  My companions ordered shared salad and flatbread which arrived without sharing plates.  The kitchen was slow and the wait staff insufferable. The chef is obviously very high on himself.  I was embarrassed to have taken my visiting relative there.
1,"I Love Oregano's, but this specific location is terrible.  The food is not prepared as well as the other locations.  Very Very dissapointed"
5,"I really loved this restaurant! Homestyle, diner food with a twist - including lots of options for vegetarians. The service was outstanding, as people beyond my primary server helped ensure that my drink was full and needs addressed.

I had the Ultimate Mac, and it sure was ultimate! The best mac n' cheese I've ever had. The portion size was definitely enough for two to share. I tried not to think about the calories that I was consuming when I downed the entire bowl plus the two pieces of garlic bread that came with it."
1,"While we are venting about the local ""news"" stations here - what the hell is up with all the local news-caster ladies feeling the need to look like Strippers?  Their clothes are horrible (can someone tell me why don't they have stylists?), bad hair dye jobs and way too much makeup - mainly the super glossy lips! Why does EVERYONE need to be a bleach blonde here in Scottsdale.  It's called Low Lights people.  Go to Ray Issa at Joya Spa in Scottsdale.  He will hook you up. You keep your natural color and high light with a little blonde (if you must).  You know, there is nothing wrong with being a brunette.  Minka Kelly, Jennifer Garner, many beautiful women are brunettes.  As far as the clothes.  Pretend you are a lawyer on Law and Order.  You wear an elegant SUIT.  You are talking about the news - not working as a hostess at a club! And don't get me started on the they way they market there TV spots - they are so cheesy, remember the one that was set in a diner - I believe it was Scott Light & Tram something (who is actually likable) - These kooks dressed up like bad characters from the show Alice (if you are 40 & up you may recall that show!). "" I will have a side of live"" - I wanted to shoot the screen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yikes! Make it stop - turn the channel.  And Mark Curtis needs to shave that cheesy thing above his lip!  He looks like a cop from Reno 911!"
1,"This place is gross. They did an okay job but the whole place smelled horrible and looked really dirty! 

I don't know why the reviews are so high except for these people must have never gone to a clean nail salon!"
1,"Usually, I LOVE ULTA!  Unfortunately, this Ulta is the worst I've ever experienced and constantly disappoints me.  

The store shelves are constantly disorganized and their products are out of stock, especially those which have deals in the weekly ad.   

Last week, I went to get my hair cut and the stylist stopped by to say she would be '10 minutes out as she was finishing a blow dry' ... 35 minutes later, I look over and she is basically curling each of the hair's on this lady's head into ringlets.  I kindly told one of the customer service representatives to let the stylist know I would be leaving and was no longer interested in getting any services.

Lastly, the PARKING at the Esplanade is awful!  I try not to write too many negative reviews on Yelp but this one needs to be heard...  Nonetheless, I won't be returning to this Ulta ever again."
5,"Excellent coffee! They rival another one of my Madison favorites and come in a close second to my favorite Milwaukee shop. I haven't been to their location, but I have had their coffee at restaurants."
5,"Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):
9 Food
10 Service
10 Atmosphere
7 Value

I'm upgrading this to a 5-star, along with boosts to Service and Value.  Jeff is great behind the bar; he offered me a sample of a new wine he thought was great (Titus) which was indeed great - in the end that's the glass I got.  Value also got an add because of the happy hour menu.  Basically non-happy hour I'd give Cheuvront 4-stars, but on HH it's a 5!"
1,"The appearance and cleanliness of this place is really nice, however there isn't hardly any variety what so ever for there buffet. There is one table of food and that's it and most of there food was cold and tasted exactly like those canned foods that you buy at the grocery store. Price is outrages for what they offer as I went to golden corral with my spouse, and spent the same amount, exact same and got a ton and I mean a ton of options, and best of all there food tastes great! Sadly I do not and would not recommend this place to anyone. If you are looking for a buffet try golden corral or the mandarin, but don't be lured in by the appearance of this Indian place as you will leave disappointed."
1,"Anyone that calls what they serve here chilaquiles has never had a decent plate of chilaquiles in their life.  I was really disappointed to say the least when I was served a plate of soaked tortilla chips in a pasty, canned-tomato sauce... My husband said his huevos rancheros were ok, but then again he'll eat anything.  The place was getting pretty full for lunch, so maybe other menu items were better Phoenix, AZ 85008than the sad and pathetic dish that I got."
5,"The food here is fantastic. The staff are very nice and helpful. I will come back as often as I can (given that I don't live in Phoenix).

My sister had the Meatloaf. It is the best meatloaf I've had in as long as I can remember. Better than my mom's (and she makes a mean loaf). Complex flavors that just worked. Served with the mashed potatoes and gravy, which are great on their own, but even better when paired with the meat. 

I had the pesto chicken sandwich. Relatively gigantic for the price ($11) given the quality of the ingredients. I was impressed. The focaccia bread was fresh. Chicken breast perfectly cooked. Big, thick hunks of cheese can't remember what kind...whatever it was it was great). It was enough for two meals.

I wish I had two stomachs so I could come here and order both meals at the same time. Planning on coming back tomorrow. You will not be disappointed."
1,"We went to Phoenix Zoo on Wednesday 08/28/13.  It was very disappointing even those we got to the zoo at 8am, there are no animals to see, it is so hot they hide in their house.  After working for like an hour, I was thinking it what a waste of money & I was pissed & thinking I want my money BACK! Hey 4 tickets is a lot to paid & nothing to see. It is so hot in a 3 digits degree. There are some places you have to pay additional money for the rides.  Finally, we come to the money village. This house 15 cute Squirrel Monkeys & the cool part is you get to go inside the cage to get close to them. Off course, you can't touch them & there are many zoo keeper there to keep the monkeys from attacking you & from you touching the monkeys. Another place in the zoo which makes our money worth is the stingrays feeding. Off course, you have to pay additional money to go in & buy the food (fish & shrimps) to feed the stingrays.  There are 31 stingrays in the tank.  FYI, if you gonna let you kids feed the stingrays, you have to be there at noon, lunch time.  Also you must bring a change of clothes for your kid to change afterward, because the smell from the stingray's food (frozen fishes & shrimps) smell HORRIBLE.  We been to bigger & better zoo with much animals & many other activities to for kids to do. However, feeding the stingrays & be in the cage with the monkeys are the 2 things other zoo don't have. At least these 2 activities make my money worth because my niece & nephew loved it.  Will not return, one time is enough."
1,This is a scam... They're pretending to be another shop and they're really sunwest auto trying to rip you off. The real Simon and sons is a dif number and address. I was ripped off and both shops were caught in lies when confronted. Going to the better business bureaus to file complaint
1,"Why did I agree to go here? BLAAAAAAH! Even for fast casual Japanese food, it sucked. I got the low-carb (no rice) teriyaki salmon bowl. The vegetables _ a mix of cabbage, broccoli and carrots _ had no flavor whatsoever. It was like hospital cafeteria veggies. Ever hear of salt or using a flavored broth? The sauce on the salmon was OK but once you eat off the top layer, no flavor inside at all. It was not worth $6.62 or whatever the price. I rarely go so far as to say ""Oh I could have cooked better at home"" but in this case, it's true. One of the worse meals I can remember having. And their shiu mai dumplings obviously frozen and then cooked because a) way too labor-intensive otherwise and b) that had more flavor. How can it be next door to Cherry Blossom Noodle? I need a good meal to counteract this."
5,"1st time trying this place, decided to come here since I work nearby.

Drove right in with no wait, cashier was friendly.  Waited about 45 mins for my SUV but let me tell you, my SUV looked brand new again.  They took their time and cleaned/ wiped every area of inside surface. Windows and mats where given a good clean.

I'm really impressed and will def. be using this place for all my car washes. Thank you Los Olivos for a job well done!"
5,"Drinks are stiff, and the bartender is awesome.  I lived in this town for 26 years and didn't know this place existed.  Come in and ask for Justin, he'll treat you right.  He makes a mad decent Tom Collins.

The summer sausage sandwich is a pure Sconnie experience and paired with the mini corn dogs is the bees' knees.

The sound system is nice and the jukebox is deep if that matters to you."
1,Why is the the Heard museum putting up that tacky 8ft black aluminum fence around the museum? They are going to ruin the great historic charm of the museum. It is going to look like a prison in the middle of our nice historic neighborhoods. Please call Letitia Chambers President and CEO of the Heard Museum at 602-251-0227 to voice your opposition to the fence.
5,One of my favorite places to eat.   Zucchini Pancakes are awesome!!!  We mostly eat breakfast here but I'm sure lunch and dinner are just as good.
5,Best donuts anywhere. Krispy Kreme has nothing on this place.
1,"OK, I must start by saying that this horrible experience was made right byt he owner who was aghast and refunded my entire $50 ticket! I took my wife and daughter out for a special Christmas tea - or I thought so. It was not very Christmas like, although they were not advertising as such, and the music was Christmas, but rocky. The decor was not as quaint as I was hoping, more like old grandma grunts than chabby chic and garden like. Country not Victorian. Anyway, it was the experience we were looking for, and my wife had been here before. 
Well, we started off with a brand new waitress, nice girl, but zip on the training, than a girl with three months experience came out, again, no training. Both of these girls would seem happier in a less than Victorian life. We asked about teas and blends, but had no assistance. They only offered a couple and you had to share the pot! What is the deal with that - for $19 bucks a pop I wanted my own pot of earl grey while my wife sipped on apricot! 
Well, one waitress was quitting that day and decided to slam her boss over and over again to us, we were about to leave when the owner came out - we said it was not the experience we were looking for, she apologized and the service got slightly better. Where were the tea cups - we had punch glasses and cracked porcelain with stains. No plates at first, the tea was nothing to write home about. 
My daughters tea was ok, the cookie was boring, artless and lacking in any frosting or style. The finger sandwiches were pretty good - not quite British, more like deli style, but tasty. The scones a bit dry and the jam, maybe WalMart strawberry.  The worst was the dessert. COSTCO SPECIAL! Little dainties of mini eclairs and mini cheesecake squares still frozen with some Rheddi Whip Cream on the side. My six year old loved as she has a dairy intolerance and took an enzyme and she got to splurge. All of this with the griping trainer and the poor helpless trainee for 19 bucks a person. What else could you ask for? A REFUND - which the owner graciously gave us. The place has potential - but needs to work out the kinks, up the presentation, get a better scone recipe, take some time to learn about teas and train their staff, and YES - learn to bake desserts! A 3 tiered plate for presentation and some real tea cups would be nice too! Sorry TEETER house - my Christmas special was a bomb - the best part of it was I did not have to pay for it."
1,"Very upset at this place,  I'm outside in the beer garden having a cigarette when the owner came up to me and said that I smell pot on my person. I told him that I was a medical patient and that I medicated before I got to the bar.  He told me not to smoke in the parking lot.  I told him I haven't,  that I know the laws. Then he accused me of smoking in the parking lot.  I really feel discriminated here and I will not come back.  Even when u respect their rules, they feel they can just discriminate u and call u out in front of everyone. Definitely will not be coming back"
5,Great place and loved their panang beef curry. I haven't had such a flavorful panang curry in a long time!  Might go back again this week while I am still in town!
5,"I recently won a happy hour party for me and my friends, so we went last night.  The waiter was very friendly and attentive to our group.  The appetizers were wonderful and the waiter was very helpful when we asked what he recommended--his recommendations were right on!  We got an order of wings and asked to have the sauce on the side because we were not sure how it would taste--the wings came out nice and crispy--yum!  And it was perfect because some of us at them naked and some with the sauce--perfect!  The Italian nachos were great and we had few birthdays in our group so we were treated to some yummy dessert!  We will definitely be back!"
5,"I have to force myself to limit how often I come to Chico's, because it's so good. First off they offer chips and a trip to the salsa bar right after you pay for your order. This way you get a quick appetizer and something to keep you entertained while they cook your order. But there's only one thing I order each time I come here, Nachos! This place has the most delicious plate of nachos that I've come across in the area. Of course the serving size is generous, I usually make it a point to not finish the plate, it's so big. It has the standard toppings, the beans are good, the red sauce that they drape over it is great. But what makes these better then most is first the cheese, love the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on. But what wins me over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler, which makes it all nice and hot, melts, crisps up the cheese and the chips. The combination of it all is a heavenly splurge that doesn't hit a spot, but burns a new special place of its own into your gastronomic mind! So beware... 

Staff here has always been nice, I've never had an order go wrong, never had an issue on quality or consistency."
1,Can I give no stars.  What a horrible place to get service work done. got an estimate for tune up on a hedge trimmer and a weed eater.   So the hedge trimmer they gave me a horrible estimate that was more than double what it should have been when I said no they told me I owed a 18 dollar fee for the estimate and said I should just leave the trimmer since it is not worth any thing.  I ended up selling for 150 on craigs list FYI with out the tune up.   they even charged to add string to test the weed eater.  Place is a total rip off I will never go again.
1,"Lindstrom Family Auto Wash / Car Wash, I actually signed up to Yelp just to write this review!! I would never recommend this car wash to anyone. Myself or family will never go again!!! My girlfriend has been going to this car wash for 5 years. Just recently she had the car detailed for the first time and during that process they went through her glove compartment into her day planner and stole her credit card. Unbelievable. Now she has a reason that she keeps it in the glove compartment that I won't go into because I don't want the thief to know what lies ahead of them, but it just amazes me how sneaky ridiculous people at this establishment are. She has a baby seat in the back and they felt that she would have something in her glove compartment that would better serve their current self centered life. I usually never write reviews unless the company did an amazing job where I felt compelled to write a review or they did something so terrible I felt that I had to write a review. So now, I'm compelled to make sure that they feel a consequence of their employee's actions. In business, you're only as strong as your weakest link and if this is their idea of providing a service that people want and need then they need to close shop. If this is the way all of them think and the kind of reputation that they want then I hope that they're happy with the attention that they're going to get from this."
5,i called Union Cab because they were offering FREE rides to the polls and back home today. I was so happy when i found that out because i had no idea where i was supposed to vote and Union cab really helped me out. The dispatchers were friendly and professional. They were also much faster than Badger Cab and the drivers were friendly and they didn't look like they just gotten out of prison like some of the Badger Cab drivers tend to look.
1,"This review is not about my stay at the Biltmore but about not staying here. I purchased a gift certificate at a baseball related charity function in Oct. When I went to redeem my gift certificate (which I wanted use during the baseball Spring training months) I was told the dates I had chosen were unavailable. OK, I understand as on my certificate it did say subject to availability, so I choose a couple of other dates. After a couple of phone calls I was finally told that all Spring training dates were blackout. My problem with all of this is that it took many phone messages and emails to finally have someone tell me this. The Director of Sales and Marketing contact person who was on my gift certificate NEVER returned an email or phone call and when asked if there were any other options none were offered. I would also like to add that I have a 2 night stay certificate and was looking to stay 2 additional nights at full price. Bottom line really bad bad customer service."
1,"Hmmmm, that's interesting. I wrote a scathing review about Lazybones on Friday. It is now posted in the filtered reviews. Please read! This is a terrible company."
1,"I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money."
5,"This place will always have a special place in my heart for reasons known by me and Steve L. :-)

I'm fairly new to the world of craft beers, but I'm a big fan of the beer list here. Always something new and interesting to try.

I haven't had a proper dinner here yet, just appetizers. They have been just ""ok"". The menu sounds promising, though.

I like the open style of the kitchen area, always curious to see what folks are up to in there. The wait staff was very attentive, if slightly impersonal, as well. I found it odd that a waitress was allowed to work wearing flip flops, though. (I notice details.)

It was a nice cozy place to wind up the end of my work week last night. To be continued..."
1,company dose not care about getting rid of flies in restaurant.  It is awful. Service is not good.
5,"One of my ""must stops"" when I am in Phoenix. Great breakfast, awesome Horchata & the best Carne Asada Tampiquena around. Granted, the chips and salsa are nothing to rave about but everything else here is superb. 

The staff is very polite and service is prompt and reliable."
5,Gotta give a big THANKS! to this Walgreens.  I found myself there shoeless with an overheated dog and they had no problem letting me come in with the dog to buy some water for him.  It is rare for a big chain store to be so dog and barefoot friendly!
1,"My boyfriend and I went here because we had a $25 gift card and thought we'd get a cheap meal. Too bad TGI Fridays is incredibly overpriced. Maybe it's my own fault for choosing something besides a hamburger, but the pasta dinner I ordered was just awful. It was clearly a frozen meal they just heated up (I asked for no mushrooms and they told me it wasn't possible). I know many restaurants do this, but when I get a $50 bill for food I could have heated up at home it doesn't make me happy. Might as well go to Denny's. Same quality food, way better price."
1,"Just because you have the word Plantation, implying old Southern American charm, in your name doesn't mean you can't provide modern services like clean restrooms? Perhaps you could sweep the floor. And wipe down the counter. Oh, I know, maybe the pigeon poo could be scraped off the tables. I know. I know. I'm asking so much. And you'd think with a sort of Southern American name, you'd have that Blanche Deveroe, drawl and all, southern service, friendly and warm, like a peach cobbler on an autumn afternoon. Sadly, no. If I were to go again, I shall bring my Dustbuster, Lysol and my Miss Manner Guide to Etiquette book (yes, I do have one, quit laughing Kristin and Stevey P.) Rants aside, the coffee was passable. Although the coffee station was messier than the Circle K near the airport. It looked as a group of overly caffenited monkeys had just used it. And the croissant. Was like a pastry boomerang. And yes, when I threw it, sadly, it came back to me!  I have better Pillsbury products in my fridge. Coffee Plantation. Ya'll don't come back now, ya hear!!"
1,"I ate here on Dec 1st (big mac combo) and it did not feel well after words. I learned that they and all Mc D's use ammoniated beef, it is frank'in food. Madison is full of privately owned restaurants that serve real food, not chemical and byproducts dressed up as food. Save your kids, save your self. Just say no to the evil fake food"
5,"Far better then Bennett's for breakfast.  Very clean.  Barkeeps very friendly.  The other customers, bunch of ole timers.  Gotta love the stories they tell, and banter back in forth.   You walked a stranger, but you leave there as family.
And the food is good too."
5,"I worship Monty's. Yummy food. Service is usually great (but there are the occasional slip-ups).  

Small dining room; booth seats and bar seating (try to grab a bar stool so you don't have to wait in line).  Wait can range from 15-30 minutes, I've never waited longer but probably would.  Breakfast is my favorite, although lunch is great too.  I usually get the regular, eggs, potatoes, bacon/sausage and biscuit.  I switch my biscuit out for toast (I just don't like biscuits, sorry!).  My mom, the vegan, usually orders her regular tofu scrambler...not bad!  But the potatoes are why I'm there.  They give you plenty and it usually looks like I haven't even touched my meal after I'm done. 

Try the Meatloaf sandwich for lunch. Yum!  There waffle fries are also delicious. They have a display of pies in the front, though I've never tried them.  The delicious breakfast, nice staff, and cozy environment sold me."
5,"The ribs are the best BBQ in Madison by far and have never disappointed in many visits. The rest of the menu is inconsequential -- trust me, just get the ribs."
5,"Delicious terriyaki chicken ... and always delivered with a huge smile.  

Blue Fin is a family operated business.  The people who work there are the absolute nicest people in the world!  You can tell they really enjoy cooking for their customers and they make you feel like family when you eat there - even if it's you're 1st time there.  

You need to try this place if you haven't.  GREAT FOOD, GREAT PEOPLE, AND GREAT PRICES."
1,"This place is horrible. If you are under 39 and from out of state, they will ID you and then take your order, then you will be ID'd again and with a 2nd form of ID (credit/debit card). Never in my life has this happened to me. And the managers on duty (Anissa or Amy) was completely rude and defensive. Her arguments were invalid and offensive. DO NOT GO HERE!"
1,"Ok.... This was an awful experience!!! A friend and I decided to check thus spot out because we pass it frequently, it was late, we were hungry and it was open. It's was fairly slow with 7 tables or so occupied, however, there was only one waitress. We noticed the food coming out pretty fast which was cool, however, the waitress was AWFUL.... so rude and unprofessional. We ordered a milk shake because they are suppose to be known for great milkshakes but was we was served was a watery mess. We explained we didn't want it and she told us we still would pay for them. After contesting, she grabbed the milkshakes, said something in spanish and walked off. Seconds later, she slams the cups in the sink and began yelling. Luckily, we already had our food!!! From that moment on she had the worst attitude and tossed the bill in the table and walked away!!!! The food was good but the service is the WORST!!!! Yikes!!!!!"
5,"We always seem to miss these cheese shops passing through the Dells. We stopped here coming back from Des Plaines in Oct., and it's right off the exit. As you enter there is a display of fudge, but they only want to cut it for you on the way out. Next are all the gadgets and gifts. I got some cool reading glasses, a ghost cheese spreader, body shampoo, a WI shot glass, cheese slicer. We were hosting the upcoming fountain pen meeting and bought a great variety of meats and cheeses. One large beef summer sausage I brought to my thanksgiving hostess. Picked up a cranberry jelly, various crackers. I got to sample all the cheese spreads, and settled on the sharp cheddar. I loved the beef and cheese snack pack because they came in small bites. We left with a few sundries, and of course the fudge. Be prepared to drop at least $100. And this was us restraining ourselves."
5,I'd never been here before but it was a great experience.  We saw Avenue Q in the Hormel Theatre.  It's very small and intimate - great place to see a show.  We had excellent seats but I suspect just about every seat is a good one.  Looking forward to coming back!
5,"Friendly staff and very attentive. So far, the Ruben is my favorite. All in all, a great sports bar/ grill."
1,"I'm writing this review purely as a seller. 

So I am a total shopaholic!  I guess that's what happens when you work in the industry.  Anyways, I cleaned out my closet and came here and they literally took 1 pair of jeans out of maybe 40-50 items.  I mostly brought in some old work clothes from Banana Republic and just some odds and ends that no longer fit.  This place is solely for indy/punky/trendy, which they do make quite clear so they are what they say they are which is good.  Makes me kind of wonder how many people buy and sell back the same items though..."
5,"My only source of transportation for the summer is going to be my bike.  I moved back to WI this past Thursday and brought my bike in to be fixed on Friday.   I had a super helpful employee named Sam.  He checked through the computer and told me that they could take it but I probably wouldn't be able to get it back until next Tues. or possibly Wed.  Long story short, I'm going to be living in my final destination in another city and starting work so those days wouldn't work for me.  I explained this to Sam and he told me he would make sure to keep me informed about my situation and he would do all that he could to get it done by Monday.  Needless to say he called me back 3 hours later and told me that he had fixed my bike and that it was ready to be picked up.  I was floored and very much appreciative at the quality of the job as well as the insanely fast amount of time he fixed it in.  Sam, you're the best.  Williamson Bikes & Fitness... THANK YOU!I"
1,"What a disappointment.  Terrible service, no bread until requested three times, bland unseasoned food and 16 bucks for a salad. Pass on this place. Only the valet was worthwhile."
5,"As this is LITERALLY my favorite restaurant, I can't believe it's taken me until now to review it.  I carry a bottle of Smoky Jon's sauce with me when I go to other places to eat.  That's how good it is.  The pulled pork and brisket sandwiches are excellent.  I can put down a 1/3 slab of ribs, a pulled pork sandwich and their super-excellent fries with a side of corn like it's nothing.

My only small gripe is that sometimes, after about 7:00 PM (they close at 9), the ribs seem like they can be a little over-done.  (Not as tender)

Smoky Jon's turns me into a pig, and I love every delicious mouthful."
5,"The ribs, you must try them! My major mistake was getting a 1/3 slab."
1,"I know I shouldn't expect much from BK, but this location is ridiculous.  You really shouldn't even THINK of going here during lunch.  They have ONE cash register at the front of the store.  Not just one OPEN register...  they only have one register, usually being operated by the slowest person they employ.

The drive-through is no better.  Cars are backed up into the next parking lot.

If you insist on trying to eat there, I would suggest you go inside to eat, that way, when they invariably get your order wrong, you can throw it directly at them.  If you get drive-through you will end up like me, paying for a double cheeseburger only to get back to your desk and find out that they totally screwed you and only gave you a single.  You will then slam your fists on your desk and start swearing and get called into your boss' office...  at least that's what happened with me. YMMV"
1,It you're basic bar food.  Nothing more.
1,"Although there is lots of fun to be had here- the atmosphere of the show does not make up for the lack of cleanliness and overall ""ICK"" factor.  I love me some dive bars, but this one was a little too subterranean.  That and please, ladies- when you are lip syncing, at least know HALF of the words to the song.  Just moving your mouth and jaw like an automaton is NOT fun or attractive."
1,I would give them a negative star if possible. I scheduled a 2pm pick up to the airport and No Show No Call!! Discount cab to the rescue! Yellow can suck it. Unreliable!!!
5,"Since enjoying authentic Thai food in Bangkok and particularly at the Oriental Hotel 20 years ago, I have waited for the day that a Thai restaurant somewhere else approached the delicate blend of flavors of those first tastes. It happened at Wild Thaiger. The soup and the curry were wild and wonderful, and this weekend we were dismayed to find out that we couldn't get take-out before 5pm, but we will be back soon. Big portions. Highly recommended!"
1,"Might be the worst vinyl focused store I've been into. I'd say 80% of the records, including the whatever Beatles records in the ""collectibles"" box are beat to heck (and five times the price they should be for the condition). They didn't put records in plastic sleeves. Beat 80s pop records that should be $1-2 in NM/NM shape are $6.50, but hey, there is a buy one get one half price, or something like that special. Really, the dregs of records. I flipped a little bit but there was absolutely nothing. Most of these records should be dumpstered. I'm super pro indie record stores, but sometimes when three other stores pass on stuff there is a reason it shouldn't be put out."
1,"Don't count on the people in this store to give you complete information. If they'd listened to me and addressed my needs, I could have saved hundreds of dollars."
1,"I have been using this store for some time now and noticed the manager was always in a bad mood. As each time passed it just seemed odd the mood was always the same. Well this last time I spoke with Ted (manager) he tried to upsell items I didn't need. In asking questions as to why I would need them it aggravated him to explain. So much so that he got argumentative, my assumption is I didn't say ""yes"" to all the unnecessary items. I come to find out there is another store on 32nd st and Camelback, not far, that is great. Customers come first and when it becomes a problem just to do simple tasks I'd rather go elsewhere. Save yourself time and aggravation and use another store, not worth it."
1,"I have been with Sprint for around 10 years and have always received great customer service... until now. A few days ago my phone began shutting off after just a few minutes of use, even after being fully charged.
So I brought it in to the 20th Street location and after uttering these words ""My phone keeps shutting off and I'm not sure its the batte...."" I was interrupted by the rep and told that I would have to leave my phone there for 24 hours while they ran diagnostics on it. Very inconvenient, but nothing else to do, so I agreed and was promptly hustled out the door.
I returned the next day and was informed that my phone was in perfect working order! No problems at all. Okaaaaay... So I start looking my phone over and noticed that they didn't even do a factory reset (did they even run any tests at all?)  Then two minutes later lo and behold, my phone shuts down again in front of their eyes. After a few minutes of head-scratching they changed the battery ...the battery that they said was working perfectly just a few minutes before... and now it works again.
My suggestion: Go to the Sprint store at 890 N 54th St., Chandler, AZ 85226. A bit of drive, but worth an hour of useful time as opposed to 24 hours of incompetence."
5,"I'm having a rough go learning how to use power tools and drill ish into drywall, but a great time going to ACE and learning what I did wrong and buying the appropriate things to remedy the problem and try again. 

Some might say, ""measure twice, drill once"" or even, ""if you don't know what you're doing... ask first!"" But I was talking to my bud Annette J in Detroit and realized that part of owning a home is making improvements/adjustments, doing it completely wrong, then learning a ton from your mistakes. (Thanks Annette!) 

This week I learned that joint compound comes in an easy squirt tube and corner bead makes that nice 90 degree angle where pieces of drywall meet. I also learned that you can't secure anything into corner bead, which is why having a stud finder helps if you're looking to hang a 72"" long roman shade. I also learned that I can easily patch my mistakes with some handy dandy supplies from ACE and although it took a few employees to find ""the patch guy"" he was super informative about exactly what I would need to fix some holes and a chunk of dry wall where my poor shade decided it would rather hang than be secured to my window frame. 

Oh gravity. 

Jason H is right, these are some of the nicest people you'll meet with loads of info to help you do it right the second time. 

I wouldn't have it any other way."
5,"I have been going to the Matador since I was in grade school. They have consistently good no-frills Mexican food and I much prefer it over the chain locations that are around. It's a nice large location downtown and has been renovated since many of the reviews on here were posted. Yes, the service has been slow from time to time over the years but I haven't ever had any more trouble here than at most other restaurants. It's a locally owned family business that has been in the family for over 30 years. If you're looking for something gourmet, then this is not your place. If you are looking for the Mexican version of comfort food, give it a try!"
5,"Bob, Pat, and Happy made my stay memorable and enjoyable! 

I stayed in the Token Creek room which is located on the ground floor. The room was so comfortable and clean! There was a little plate of cookies waiting for me along with water and a tiny bouquet of fresh flowers. I loved waking up and opening up the blinds to look out on the little farm that they own. It was so peaceful! 

The Inn is also centrally located (it took me 15 minutes from the time I left their inn to drop off my rental car and get through security at the airport) even though it feels like you're in the country. I don't think I left a 10 mile radius while I was there and was able to see everything I wanted. 

Every breakfast was phenomenal. Bob smoked the breakfast meats himself, ham one day and bacon the next. The eggs came from their chickens, the cheese and cranberry juice were also sourced from Wisconsin. I love eating local! We had some great conversations about food, wine, work (pre-running the Inn), entrepreneurship, and owning your own dream business. 

Last but not least, they're golden doodle, Happy, made me happy every time I saw him. If I wasn't flying home I might have tried to steal him. ;o) 

I will be recommending this Inn to anyone who is traveling to or through Madison!"
1,"We were here for the last 1st Friday and this place was a Disaster (again with the capital D thing).  It was so bad, that I canceled my wine order and got a Schlitz from the hot dog guy.  We waited for 2 hours (not exaggerating) for SANDWICHES.  The sandwiches were good, but I'm telling you, if it could've gone wrong for them, it did.  I'm not sure if that is the ""charm"" of this place or if our server was a complete train wreck.  
Also, apparently we aren't good enough for 1st Fridays or the crowd it attracts.  Maybe we're not artsy enough or trendy enough or hippy enough for the crowd here.  Although, you artsy, trendy hipsters don't live in the neighborhood, you drove you Subaru's and your old jalopies here, we walked here, we're from the 'hood'.  See the difference.  You came to our hood.  OK, enough ranting about snobbery going on.  I've spent way too much of my time on this review, which I wasn't going to post until it came up in conversation the other day."
1,"This place is dump. The air filter above the pool has an inch of dust on it. The tow lights in the steam room do not even work. On e light fixture has been almost pulled off the wall. The Jacuzzi water is disgusting. 
This company does not care at all several of us have told them several times to get it fixed. They just blow us off. Don't join this place!!! I would rather see them go out of business so  a good company would buy it."
5,"No No No, not the Sprinkles...
I am ALL About the Maple Long John!!!

Made the stop this morning for a little Christmas Eve Eve dozen for My Battle Buddies in ""The Cubes""! Haha. They are so warm and moist this early in the morning. I do recommend that you try to make the short drive on over to The the Rainbow for a tasty treat. Have an Amazing Day Arizona!"
5,"This is a must try if you live in Phoenix and like Thai food. Great food, clean/hip place, great service, reasonably priced...what more can you ask for?"
1,"I'd give this place 0 stars if possible. Went there for pickup and the waitress was EXTREMELY rude!! Acted like I was wasting her time, didn't say hello or goodbye, just kind of left us standing there awkwardly after she handed us the reciept. The food was very overpriced for what you get (got the felafel dinner) and the felafel was very dry. Don't go here!"
1,"I had gone to Eagles crest for lunch a few times and decided to take my family, from out of town, one weekend. When we arrived, there was a sign on the front door saying that it was customer appreciation day. We Bought a round of drinks and found a table to sit at. Other patrons were going through the food line which was set up at the pool table.  But my sister-in-law went To get a veggie plate, One of the female staff came from around the bar and slapped the plate out of her hand And told us that we were not welcome there. We finished our drinks and left. As we were leaving we checked the sign on door again to see if it was marked private party, but it was not. After that experience I will never go back to Eagles Crest."
5,"My husband and I set out to find a new bed and mattress, Rubin's Clearance was the first place we stopped. We found a great quality all wood bed at a great price and a Rubin's mattress and we love it. The salesperson was not pushy and very helpful. In fact, all of them were very nice. They charge a little more than other places for delivery and set up but not that bad, and they will not remove your old bed. All in all, we are very happy with the purchase, the mattress is fantastic and I would recommend a Rubin's mattress for sure. It saved us from going to several stores that day. I would recommend Rubin's Clearance Store to others."
1,"Thought I would stop at drive thru for quick lunch, twenty minute later with two cars in front of me waiting on there order i decided to leave. Felt bad for the cars in front of me that had already had paid for their food. When I left the car behind me followed as well.  I stopped here a couple of months ago and ordered inside and the wait was probabley just as long but they had money so I waited. I saw that they had remodeled and I hoped the found some new management and employees. The concept of taking one order, then making that order before taking or starting another order is not the concept of the way a fast food restraunt should be run. Change the management and improve service, clean the inside and you might have a viable operation.  The McDonalds down the block does not suffer from this poor management, just suffers from the McDonalds food."
5,"Actors Theatre Phoenix is a really cool organization - they are supported by ticket sales of their productions and by local donors.  They've been around for over 21 years...

I've been to several of their productions and hope to attend many more!  A Christmas Carol is a big one that starts soon and runs through December 23rd.  

The other shows they have are always unique, deeper, though-provoking, sometimes risque, but always professional.  We need to support Actors Theatre to keep these shows coming!

Actors Theatre performs exclusively at the Herberger Theater Center in downtown Phoenix. 

Hope to see you at a show sometime soon!"
1,"Ive had aprox. 5 alignments done there over the past few years and always had good work done.  Joel is always very nice, however Ken  (the older gentleman) is usually in a bad mood and probably needs to retire. Last time I was there he was very short and rude. I don't know if he was having a really bad day or what, but I wont be going back."
1,"What's worse than a chain taqueria with no ambiance, really bad tasting food, and rude staff? Nothing. 

I almost never eat at these big chain half-fast food restaurants. I didn't have high expectations, but I thought it would be better than taco bell. Wrong. 

The tacos I got on taco tuesday tasted terrible, and then gave me about 12 hours of food poisoning.

Go to a mom and pop taco shop and avoid this place like fire avoids water."
1,"Will NEVER take our dog here again. Our dog spent two nights here and I can't believe the damage that was done in that time. Upon pick up we asked how she had done, and were told, ""She's on Facebook!"" (which she wasn't...) but weren't given any legitimate information. What actually had happened was that ALL of her gums were bruised and her teeth were covered with metal from chewing on a cage for 2 days straight. The next week at home she cried in pain when she played with any chew toys. She had lost a noticeable amount of weight (in 2 DAYS) so who knows if she was fed. He nose was swollen and there was a quarter sized wound on the top of her nose. When we asked the staff who walked her out to us what happened he had no idea. 

Having our fun-loving happy dog be visibly terrified walking out to us and not even looking up to see who we were until she could smell us upset me us so much. If you love or care about your dog spend the extra 5 dollars for a place that cares about animals."
5,"Simply the Best. When you want to impress your guests, or a business colleague, take them here? Completely safe, guarded, protected, patrolled parking lot for those of you scared to venture into unfamiliar territories. Outstanding from beginning to end. From friendly, enthusiastic welcomes, to prompt tableside attention. Delicious Margarita and Dos Equis to wash down fresh chips, and fiery salsa served in a delightful tiny gravy boat for pouring or dipping. At least 4 servers tending to your every whim from delivering food, to clearing plates. Presentation is everything and here they do it right! From spotless, immaculately clean everything, everywhere you look, to pressed slacks and dress shirts on all the servers, there is pride in everyone's performance here. The food is the Bonus! Excellent flavor, robust and tangy, complex, plentiful, fresh and filling. You want to clean your plate! Prices are more than fair and reasonable for what you get! Charming Mexico Decor throughout without being gawdy or cheesy. Nice enough to impress a date before a concert or show Downtown. Absolutely my favorite place to dine in South Phoenix."
5,"Fantastic food, fantastic service, extremely clean inside. One of the best, if not the best Mexican food restaurants in AZ. South Phoenix hidden gem. Blows ponchos out of the water. Definitely coming back."
5,"Loved staying here.  We were going up to Madison for the day and found this place through a quick Google search of Madison-area B&B's.  Craig (the owner) was so helpful and friendly when I called to inquire about prices and availability.  He was also awesome and asked about our dietary preferences (I'm a vegetarian who's also temporarily gluten-free, whereas my boyfriend will eat anything) and promised to have a yummy breakfast we would both love.  When we got to The Parsonage, I was so happy we decided to stay there instead of in Madison proper.  It was quiet and cozy.  We picked the Mentor room which had a big awesome jacuzzi tub in there, and also a really nice outdoor patio (which was covered in snow, but i bet will be awesome when spring comes!).   Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE, i think i actually miss it.  Since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  Breakfast the next day was so nice.  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  There was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  The conversation was also really nice - I like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, Craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  Great people and great company.  Next time we are in the Madison area, we will definitely stay here.  Craig, thanks for all the hospitality!  From Denise and Justin"
5,"Welcome Diner, talk about fantastic! Browsed around and found this diner, in a neighborhood many would consider not welcoming, they could not be more wrong. The homemade biscuit, made with love and of course incredible honey, just delicious down to the last crumb. A welcoming staff and food that can leave you stuffed! Will definitely keep coming back and invite all who will join. If you your a local you need to eat here, if your visiting phoenix, you need to eat here! As always my yelpers, eat, drink, explore, and buy local!"
1,"Went to pick up a bouquet for my sister in law. As I was getting my son out of the car, he runs for a corvette parked a few spots over (a seriously rad looking one too). The owner comes out screaming ""you can't park here"" and tells us to leave. I suppose he thought we were headed to the bar next door. I was about to tell him we were there to buy flowers, but he was so rude we just left instead."
5,"I LOVE this place-I went to L'Etoile on Friday night and Monty's Blue Plate on Saturday afternoon-guess where I had the better meal?!?  Monty's won by a landslide-a giant bowl of veggie chili, a square of jalapeno corn bread as big as my head and a slice of chocolate rasberry pie a la mode.  It doesn't get much better than this folks!  I cannot wait to go back, I've actually had a dream about that pie!"
5,"Wow! Another amazing performance from Actors Theatre of Phoenix. Hunter Gatherers is a very captivating and thought provoking play that kept the audience involved all night long. It's these types of edgy, unexpected plays that make every trip to see a new opening of Actors Theatre a joyous surprise."
5,"We really like this place.  Cozy, fireplace, really good coffee.  Some nice paintings on the wall but the one is a myth.  It shows Monona Terrace with the sun setting nearby.  ( I think it is the sun- I forget)  Anyway, the terrace sits toward the north and it would be pretty tough to paint the sun there.  Other than that it is a good painting.  The painting of downtown Madison in the rain is fantastic.   I wonder if I could buy that one?
Enjoy the coffee."
5,"Went there twice this week alone. 

Service is great, the owner actually thanked us for our business and was really helpful when trying to order. Cucumber salad was great both times. Went with a group of 3 today and had to sit outside because there are only 2 tables that hold more than 2 people inside.

Great place to eat, I'd go back."
1,"I would give this Capital Grille location no stars if possible. I don't mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the ""corporate recipe"", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their ""signature"" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away. Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food. We might as well set $500 on fire."
5,"I just really love the Alwun House. I have been to several events there over the last couple of years including the Monster's Ball this past Halloween weekend. For each event I have gone to, the artwork in this art house was very relevant to the theme. I like being able to see art while I am getting my party on! The cover to the events are reasonable and drinks cheap. They also typically have complimentary appetizers which is always welcomed with long lines. 

Entertainment (besides the always interesting people watching) usually consists of some performance art, magic tricks, DJs spinning beats, and my favorite, a burlesque troupe (Provacatease). At times a little kooky, I always find it enjoyable and have a great time at these parties. The crowd is varied and full of fun weirdos. I love it! 

Besides the main events, Alwun House also hosts speakers, poetry and rotating exhibits. You can become a member for $25 a year, too, which helps support this local spot."
5,Great place to chill...  always quiet and can get lots of work done...
5,"Excellent food, portions and value!!!  Don't let the unconventional locale fool you...Definitely a must-stop whenever in the 7th St & McDowell vicinity.  Go for any of the asada and pollo plates and nachos...You won't be disappointed!"
5,"i cannot believe that no one had yelped this place- thank you jaymi and michelle, you are geniuses. 

my friends from madison visiting a couple weeks ago told me that michaels is  just as it was when i was there maybe 8 years ago so this review should be accurate. one word sums it up. PERFECTION. they also told me they dont go often, or at least every day, which i would. you would be beyond obese but it would be worth it. i have only had the frozen custard here and being lactose intolerant but in denial makes it a rough experience. there is nothing like this in the world- italian gelati, nopee, argentine ice cream del dios, cant touch this shit. 

michaels frozen custard is literally the best taste sensation i have experienced in my life. that is a big statement and im owning it.  it doesnt even matter what flavor you get, its that good. you dont even have to get toppings on it- though i would toss some peanut butter cup chunks on. could be worth the drive to madison alone."
5,"Well worth the drive for Madisonians. The brewery has a nice little bar inside and, in the summers, a beer garden outside.  The brewery also has something else inside: lots of really, really good beer.  If you're a fan of the Capitol Brewery, this is a religious pilgrimage.  There's a gift shop and a tour (which should be taken, camera in hand).  Standing in the warehouse surrounded by kegs stacked to the ceiling is a near-religious experience."
5,"This might be the best run McDonalds in the Madison area. The drive-through runs incredibly fast! Plus, it's a throw back McDonalds with a displayed old milkshake machine that triggered Ray Kroc's involvement in the company, and resulted in him bringing in a franchise model that facilitated the restaurant's world-wide domination. However, who checks for a McDonalds rating?"
1,"This used to be on my very short list of ""favorite"" restaurants. Everything was perfect - except the Pad Thai (I am a traditionalist when it comes to Pad Thai and it's not realy Pad Thai at fate, the noodles and the sauce are wholly different).  

The crab puffs were amazing, the ambiance was clever and appropriately aloof/warm.  I even enjoyed the loud music next door, the bar was comfortable - and the scene was young and nutty.,  Loved it.  

I am sad to see this place die out. I have NOT visited FATE since SENS opened up - I was hoping SENS and FATE would do some joint marketing and certainly there was enough interest for them to work as a team - but alas, FATE moved on without Jonny and that was a huge mistake.

See my review of SENS.  That place just keeps getting better and better.  I am addicted.  We go very often and enjoy everything about the people and the food."
1,"Ordered the fish tacos with rice and beans. Bland, awful. Fish was overfried. Beans were not that wonderful smooth creamy texture that refried beans are supposed to be. Won't be going back."
5,"I wish I would have tried this place sooner!  My husband had only tried it once while working downtown and had never mentioned it to me.  That was until, I was sick of the usual and suggested we stop downtown on the way to Chandler.  

I ordered a regular Cheese Steak with onions (banana peppers on the side).  It was incredibly juicy, flavorful, and beyond delicious!  I scarfed it down and wanted more.  In fact, a week later, I went back for another b/c I could not stop thinking about how good it really was.  But this time, we went during lunch hour on a weekday and it was so busy that I didn't get as much meat...so it wasn't as good as the first time.  I will be back though, just not on a busy weekday.  I loved that they also sold east coast desserts (TastyCakes, which I had never had and liked) and chips.  The service was very good, on my first visit and even during lunch hour."
1,"Let's be honest, when it comes to BBQ places that are decent, the valley is sorely lacking.  So, when I brought up the fact that I was having a serious itch for some Q, a coworker brought Honey Bear's up. Having not heard of it, I was in for it.

The establishment is a hole in the wall, butsome of the best BBQ I have ever had was in holes in the wall (i.e. Aurthur Bryant's in Kansas City). We got out of the car and were greeted by the pleasant smell of wood smoking meat, and it smelled awesome. I was super excited...until we stepped into the door.

The aroma went from pecan wood chips to backed up sewage. I kid you not it smelled like someone emptied their bowels in the middle of the lobby. People would come in and turn right back around and leave. But, my friend assured me this was the place to be so darn it, I was going to stick it out.

I got the BBQ chicken sandwich. The sauce had very little flavor to it but the meat was tender (there is your one star, the ability to not dry out chicken). I asked about what side the cashier would prefer and she just shrugged and said ""I guess the potato salad."" As expected from the response, it was mediocre.

But that smell went back with me to the office where a coworker asked if I had been sitting in an alley with a drunk during lunch. I had to change my shirt but the smell was burned into my nostrils.

Never again...NEVER...AGAIN."
1,"I had a chance to read the second (and only other) review for this office that came about a year after mine. 
My review probably sounds pretty shocking because the experience WAS shocking. I describe in very accurate detail the specifics of what was dirty and what was handled unprofessionally. I did not exaggerate anything (though I fully admit my use of humor undermines the seriousness of my observations). I'm not complaining that there wasn't bottled water service or TVs, I think that's pretty clear in my review. I'm pointing out that I think (and I'm sure many others would agree) that when you go to an office where people stick their hands and instruments into your mouth, you don't want to look around and see grime on the floors, counters and walls or rust on the sink fixtures. I am not a medical professional, but anyone who has even been to a doctor has seen basic protocol when handling a patient (i.e., watching them open a clean pack of tools, watching them wash their hands in front of you before touching you), and they simply did not follow it here. 
The review is not judgmental; it was fair and honest. I pointed out the good (what little there was of it) and the bad. The doctor and all his techs and receptionist were beyond nice and I said as much. But that's hardly the most important thing here.  
To this day, I regret not walking out after the x-rays were taken. 
I do hope that the office was just in some sort of odd transitional phase and that by the time the other reviewer got there things had changed, I really do. But after what I went through, I'm not willing to give them a second chance. Their lack of professionalism and protocol put me in danger, and that's unacceptable. And not just for me, that's unacceptable for anyone -- the office does pro bono work for the homeless or kids in CPS, that's great, they deserve professional care just as much as I do."
1,"Wow.  What a really terrible experience.  We went in here to get shadescreen material for our windows...I called ahead, asked if they had the correct kind and was told by a very nice guy that they did indeed have what I was looking for.  I have been recovering from surgery and I was not able to walk or drive, so I got my dad to help me out by driving me over and going inside to do my ""legwork"".  Instead of coming out with a bundle of shadescreen material, my dad came back out of the store looking annoyed.  He said they didn't have the material and the guy in the back wanted to know the name of the guy that I spoke with.  Oops.  Sorry I didn't get his name, but if you say you have the material, why has it suddenly disappeared?

So, since we were sitting in our car in the handicapped spot just in front of the store, I decided to call and ask to speak to the manager.  He answered the phone up at the front cash register, so I could see him from our car.  I asked him what was going on and why this material was not there when I'd spoken to the guy earlier, blah blah blah.  He didn't apologize.  He didn't go check.  Didn't offer to correct the mistake by finding a store that might have it.  Nope...he said *I* must have made a mistake.  When I told him I was currently handicapped and it took a lot of effort to get to his store and that I'd called ahead precisely for that reason, he said he couldn't do anything about that and hung up the phone.  Then to make matters even worse, he POINTED at our car and started LAUGHING with the cashier at the front.  Holy crap...really?  Laugh at the handicapped girl???  Wow...I don't even know what to say about this a$$ except that I will NEVER NEVER NEVER go back here.

The Ace on 24th st is just down the street and has nicer employees even tho' it is small.  And, Paul's Ace Hardware in Tempe is by far the BEST Ace in the valley...especially if you need screening."
1,"*Businesses do have bad days, I'm very aware of that* experienced Saturday Morning 9/22/12 approx 11a

I already felt weird meeting my date at a 50s diner, being black, because back then blks/whts didn't even sit together, but I quickly got over that LOL

The design of the restaurant is pretty neat, a pink trailer. & inside, the booths are pretty retro. The menu is more extensive than one might think. I was overwhelmed by the choices.

I went with lunch during breakfast time. Ordered a chicken fried chicken w/mashed potatoes and a bowl of fruit.

I ordered apple juice, at first they told me the machine was broken so I took cranberry juice as a substitute but before I could drink that, they brought me the apple juice and swiftly took the cranberry away. This was odd to me because if the cranberry juice is already poured, and I've put my straw in it, are you just taking it and throwing it down the sink? & if you're doing that, you should just leave it for me, but whatever I was happy they had the apple juice.

The waitresses that I encountered were nice enough. I was glad they had some color in the establishment, just makes me feel more comfortable (hispanic-descent waitress).

My order came, just as I ordered it and it looked good. I always start with my fruit, as I'm eating it and enjoying it, I get to a cantaloupe piece and WHOOMP! There It Is!! There's a dead fly in my fruit cup. I showed my date and he swiftly decided we were leaving. By this time, we'd both enjoyed some sips of our drinks and our food had just been delivered and he was waiting on some butter for his pancakes. I was a little reluctant to leave because I was just so hungry.

But you can't give business to an establishment when there is a bug on your plate.

We showed the waitress who apologized and discarded my plate, however when they noticed we were leaving, they said have a great day! I mean, I don't know what else they could've said. It's not like we would've accepted a voucher to return or something because we wouldn't. But it's not the waitresses' fault, whoever prepared the fruit should've rinsed it, problem averted. I'm sure it's a nice place, however I had a bad experience so it's doomsday. They won't lose sleep over it, I wouldn't have been a regular anyway"
1,FYI. Chili's still sucks.
1,"I have stayed here in the past and am a frequent traveler in the area for business. Due to the winter weather warning and storm going on currently I am not able to get from Milwaukee to Madison to make my reservation. Hotel would not make any exceptions due to weather to get me a refund, or even a partial refund. You think they would have some sort of sympathy considering the circumstances. I believe that the safety of their customers and securing future business would be more important than a one night stay tonight. Really disappointed."
5,"We visit family in Madison at least twice a year and always make sure to have dinner here.  The shrimp sizzling rice soup is absolutely to die for, and every entree I've had has been fabulous.  Hands down the best Chinese food I have ever had."
1,"God this place is awful!!  Did it change hands between 1/19/09 when Matthew K. was there & 1/27/09 when I was there?¿?

The sign on the side of the building says ""OPEN EAT"" ...Straight forward & direct!  I liked that, so I tried it.

Inside & out, the place looks very old.  I would guess 1940s.  It's medium in size, & there were about 25 trays of food out.  There were only about 5 other customers in the place on a weekday at 12:30, which was my first warning sign.  The second was the egg flower soup.  It was gooey & blah (1940's style, I wondered?).

The food table was against the wall, so you have to reach far for the items that are in the back.  The ranch dressing was runny, & the macaroni salad blah.  The unfriendly Chinese lady brought me some ""hot tea"", which was lukewarm.  Back at the food table, the rest of the food was greasy, not very warm, or both.  The whole deal was seriously terrible... the second worst restaurant I have ever eaten at, after Wagon Wheel, Oxnard, CA.  (Fortunately that place finally folded & this one needs to as well!)

""OPEN EAT somewhere else!"""
1,"We used to go this restaurant over two years ago and usually 2 to 3 times per week.  The service at dinner time is bad, bad, bad.  Poor management and only one waiter or waitress.  We try to go back once or twice a year, hoping it gets better.  I enjoy the food and it is in the neighborhood.  I can understand why they don't pack them in anymore.  Seems like corporate would look at these reviews and make sure the service is brought up to par!  Won't be returning for at least 2 more years.  And that is probably only a MAYBE!!!!"
1,"One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had.

So, I called on a Tuesday to see if I could get some pants hemmed for a wedding rehearsal dinner. The dinner was out of town, and my flight left Wednesday night, so I knew I was asking for a really quick turnaround and I apologized for that at the start of the conversation. 

Me - ""I kinda need these pants ready by tomorrow, is that even possible?""
Mean PCT lady - ""Well, It's possible, I guess""
Me - ""Ok cool, well I'm not trying to be a jerk, but since I'm leaving tomorrow night, I need a yes or no answer... if it's no, that's totally understandable""
PCT devil woman - ""...I said it was possible, thats the same as yes, right?""
Me - ""Well, not really, possible implies that there is a chance...""
PCT satan - (cuts me off) ""Ok well thank you, but I can only tell you it's possible, so maybe you should try somewhere else."" (hangs up on me).

I call Brother's Tailors and Clothing, they were sooo awesome and friendly and they hemmed my pants that day! I was still kinda mad about how rude the PCT lady was, so I called back to ask for her manager. After a long conversation of me trying to explain how rude she was (she didn't get it) she ended the call with the statement that pretty much sums there lousy business: ""Well, we've been in business for over 50 years and if you don't like the way we do business you can go somewhere else.""

MEANEST LADY EVER!!!!!"

1,"If i could give China Chili less than one star, I would.

Friends keep dragging me there because it is walking distance from their offices.  If they keep insisting on China Chili, i might have to show up too late to get lunch. I have never had a good meal there. The worst was mushu that tasted like the vegetables in it were canned."

1,"BEWARE!!!!  I was taken advantage of by Joe and this man lacks honesty.  I had to arrive with the police to retrieve a table he was supposed to call me with an estimate to restore and come to an agreement about a price to sell it.  Instead I received a check in the mail for $250 with a note that he sold it!!!  It was still in his store for a price tag of $1,200 and he was untruthful about even that to the police.  How very sad it took the police to make things right with this dishonest fellow!"
1,"Worst place ever! First time I came here for my contact lens fitting appointment I had to wait 1 hr + and that was with an appointment. No apologies from the staff for the long wait either. Second time I went to finalize my prescription I told the doctor about how the contacts didn't feel right, I couldn't see very clearly. I've been wearing contacts for years. Discovered that on top of all the waiting the doctor and staff are incompetent because they incorrectly ordered my contacts for me and changed my -2.75 prescription to a +2.75.  Do not go here! They suck! This is for the location at 4280 E Indian School."
5,"I first started going to Millenium because I had a coupon in the Entertainment book. Amy has been cutting my hair for a couple years now. I love her! She has great ideas when I don't know what I want, and when I do she listens to me and does a good job.

She's also excellent at shaping eyebrows. 

When you arrive at Millenium, ask for a cup of chai. It's delicious. :)

I think a cut/style is about $35 or $40 which is about average for a more experienced stylist."
1,"After waiting 45 minutes for a cab, our taxi (#69) left without us because we took over one minute to leave the restaurant. I learned my lesson, and will never take anyone other than Green Cab again. Union Taxi is a joke of a company, and I strongly discourage you from booking through them."
5,Great stuffed pizza.  Great price for so much.
5,"Happy to echo the sentiments here - good, honest shop with fair prices.

No up-sell here - I've actually had them tell me I didn't need work after another shop tried to tell me I did.  Keeps me coming back, for sure.

Awesome building, and historic - apparently, the city of Monona was founded there! http://www.mymonona.com/pages/parks_recreation/parks_open_space/details.php/31/parks_open_space/schluter+beach/ 

If you have time, grab an ice cream at the bait shop a couple of doors down, and wander over to the lake."
5,"Great diner with a very creative menu.  You can certainly get your traditional eggs-and-bacon breakfast, or you can opt for a tofu scramble or zucchini potato pancakes.  What more could you ask for?  I have only eaten here for breakfast, but the desserts are tempting, too."
5,"How in the world did I forget/miss a review of the Capital Brewery?  Crikey - I'm losing it, I tell 'ya.

No visit to the Madison area would be complete without stopping-by the Capital Brewery.  During the spring/summer/fall months, their beer garden is phenomenal.  It's a large, trellised, open area that's sun-protected compliments of a huge blue tent cover/awning.  

Picnic tables galore, it makes for an ideal location to chill with friends and family.  Bring along whatever type of food you'd like, because they don't serve food here.  Or, better yet, call one of the many local restaurants and request delivery - most of them service the brewery.  Dogs are more than welcome, as are kids. 

A large stage frames the eastern side of the garden; you'll find live music on most Friday and Saturday nights.  They used to show movies on Saturday nights, but I believe that has come to pass.

The staff is always excellent.  You won't find a nicer group of folks no matter how far or hard you search.  Kyle's the absolute best - the guy is unbelievably friendly, funny, and knows everything about the brews.  He often serves as the brewery tour guide, so pay attention if he suggests you try a certain brew.

During the colder months, the indoor stube is warm and inviting.  There's a large flat screen television for game watching, and plenty of comfy seating.  The stube operates on reduced hours during the winter months, and just a heads-up that it's often times rented/reserved for private events (think holiday parties), so check their website schedule prior to planning a spur-of-the-moment visit.

The gift shop is nice, with a great selection of glasses, shirts, and other goodies.  Prices are more than reasonable.  The bathrooms are usually spotless, which is a bonus.

So... if you haven't been to the brewery, make it a priority to visit.  Stop by on a Saturday or Sunday and take the tour (it's only a couple of dollars, includes samples, and runs hourly), then spend time enjoying some of Capital's great beers.  You won't be disappointed."
5,"This was a bit off the beaten path for me - but I was looking for a grocery store that had more traditional Mexican and Southwest items in stock (I was looking to make Posole for New Years Day - it turned out GREAT!).

I went to Ranch Market for the first time and it struck me as a fantastic experience - far different from Bashas and Safeway! - I wanted to browse each aisle and explore (and I am NOT a shopper!!).  I was looking for one thing in particular - Mexican Hominy for Posole - which they had several options on - but I walked out with a full cart of groceries.

I am planning to return periodically and expand my shopping (and cooking) repertoire!!  Muy bueno del Ranch Market, gracias!"
1,"ever been to dick's last resort? you know, the restaurant we're the servers are intentionally angry and mean because its funny (kinda) and its the theme? well, this should be majerles theme cuz the service is horrid, horrid, horrid. ive never had even mediocre service there. in fact, most of their ""servers"" seem to lack a pulse...something that should be manditory for the position. how these people survive on tips is beyond me...americans are just generous people i guess."
5,"The food is great and the staff is friendly.    You gotta stop by for the lunch buffet, that is when it is at its best.  The mango chicken is awesome, it is like general tsos chicken but with a delicious mango fruity sauce, interesting and delicious.  they have offerings of a variety of smoked and seasoned meat and a small salad bar.  It is a highly recommened joint in Monona.  

Only thing wrong with it is the old building that it is in.  I frequent Davids so it can't be that bad."
1,Prices too high and service very slow. Save yourself lots of money and frustration and avoid this location. I've made the mistake of getting service here three times and always leave in a bad mood. Watch out for the aggressive up sell!
1,"You'd think with its proximity to the chi-chi yuppieville that is Arcadia, this Target would be... well... not so ghetto. This one is actually worse than the one at Christown (oh, excuse me, ""Spectrum"") Mall, and that's saying something. We'll be saving this location for emergencies only."
5,"I've been to Sam's several times and have never been disappointed. My most recent visit was last night. We skipped the appetizer only because we had tickets to a show but not to worry because the complementary chips and salsa are outstanding! You don't even need the salsa as the chips are seasoned, fresh and uniquely delicious. Husband had the chicken quesadilla and inhaled it before I could try it but he loved it. I was torn between the Stuffed Chicken and the Spinach and Portobello quesadilla. I had (and loved) the chicken dish my last visit so I went with the spinach and mushroom quesadilla which was wonderfully simple and delicious with a fresh and tasty salad on the side. We didn't have time for dessert but again, not to worry as the complementary white chocolate nibble they serve at the end of the meal hits the spot. Next time we come to Sam's we will hopefully have more time for appetizer and dessert. I also need to commend the attentive wait staff and pleasant atmosphere especially when the weather allows you to sit outside"

5,"We freaking love Paisley Violin. Now, my five stars does not mean it is perfect, it has flaws that I will mention, but I do not believe your Phoenix experience is complete without a Friday or Saturday night visit to this lovely establishment. 
The first time we walked in it felt like Cheers, everyone said hello, the musicians, the bartenders, the bar patrons, as if we were old friends returning from a long trip. Now look, it isn't pretty inside, it's divey, a weird fish tank and ventriloquist doll are kind of strangely displayed, but look past that and see this place for what it is, a local joint with real honest to goodness people serving you. Good drink, great food, great music, great atmosphere, great service.
The toasted pesto brie was delicious, the brie was not overpowering, and it complimented the pesto just right. Their vegetable stew was very good with huge chunks of vegetables and a hearty sauce, the peppered raspberry turkey is magic in your mouth, the royal is a wonderful sandwich with roast beef, mozzarella and garlic pepper and the venice violin, with soppressata, pepperoncini, balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard on a baguette is practically inspired. The desserts are good too, but not all house made, we destroyed the baklava, it's highly recommended.
Now the bad, aside from the place being divey, which isn't bad to me but I know it is to some, is that the parking is kind of a nightmare. Last I went I had to park in front of a very ghetto looking house with a guy cleaning his shotgun on the porch. Paisley Violin is not in a ""nice"" part of town, and with only a couple actual parking spots, you will be parking in a strange neighborhood in front of a stranger's house... sorry. But it's worth it, check with the Paisley Violin website and go on a night they have entertainment. 
Check this place out with a good friend and an open mind, we love it."
1,"This place made me wanna start a bad-food-diet! Ok. Maybe I should start a little more positive.

This place has decent ambience. That's about it. The restaurant staff that I encountered was non-friendly, non-welcomy, and probably non-existent!

The biggest offense is the food! I cannot believe so many other reviews were soooo positive. I came in a little late (9:15 p.m.) and that may have rubbed the waiting staff wrong, but there were 2 other parties that came in after me.

Going back to the food. I ordered Miso Ramen and an addition of cha-shu (pork), and a side of Agedashi Tofu. 
1. The Miso ramen came with a slice of salmon.  Really? Salmon??? It was not the best combination to say the least. Miso?? There was hardly any miso in the soup. It was so diluted, I almost had to imagine the taste of miso. BTW, the cha-shu was like left-over and an after-thought added to the ramen. I am guessing the owner is trying to pull a fast one.  

2. Agedashi Tofu. This is a freaking joke. An insult to the patron of the restaurant. Really!! How lazy can this restaurant get! Essentially a silken tofu deep fried with some dashi-based sauce. What did I get? A re-fried chinese firm tofu which was probably microwaved with a bunch of undercook or recooked vegetable tempura. The sauce? Dilluted straight from the bottle tempura sauce!

3. Iced Green Tea. This one is not as bad as some other Asian fusion restaurant. They actually used a decent roasted green tea with a hint of roast barley.  Unfortunately, it is so very dilluted.  The guy from the next table was complaining that he was drinking water!

I also saw something not very nice; a waiter recycling butter from a table.  I know it is sealed but, really??? in front of customers?

This place really cut corners in terms of food and service. 

Benefit of doubt? Maybe, since I tried this place only once, but once is enough for me. I saw 2 sushi rolls ordered by a couple that came in after myself. Not impressed at all.

Bottom-line, lazy effort at best. Worst case scenario, cheap food costing big bucks giving patrons food-poisoning from re-using left-overs!"
1,"Beware. This hotel really sticks it to their priceline customers.

I am a frequent business traveler, but when I travel for pleasure I use priceline.
The hotels that treat me well as a priceline customer get my return business when I pay full rate for work.

My wife and I showed up at midnight to check in. We were given a room with two small beds. I asked to be given one large bed instead, but the front desk attendant told me that as a priceline customer I had to take whatever double occupancy room they chose to give me. I understand this is the priceline policy, but most hotels make an effort to accommodate if they have vacancy. I even offered to pay extra and the front desk attendant then claimed there were no other rooms available despite the mostly empty parking lot outside.

Crowne Plaza just struck out. Back to Marriott and Hilton I go."
1,"If I could have given today's experience negative stars, I would have.

The food was average. Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet.

From the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were ""going to need a high chair for that?"" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter.

We were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left.

She knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us.

In this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them.

Another server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal.

We go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food.

At no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back.

I'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out.

I guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable."
5,"I am near the conclusion of a high risk twin pregnancy and have had an excellent experience with PPA (7th street office).  I was being seen every 2 weeks for 7 months and have found the office staff courteous, the ultrasonographers top notch (they knew the sex of the twins at week 12!) and the physicians knowledgeable and warm.  It is true that the wait times can be long especially in the afternoon but this is a fact of life in a high risk practice where many of the patients are very complicated.  To minimize this issue i would ask for the first available morning appointments if you can work this into your schedule.  To me, modifying my schedule seemed insignificant compared with the outstanding care i and my twins were receiving.  

A primary issue id like to address is the continuity of care.  This is a large practice with 10+ doctors and it is true that at time the doctor was not overly familiar with my case since the doctors do rotate among 3 valley locations.  We had no significant complications so this was not that big of an issue for us but i can see how that would be difficult for someone who had a serious ongoing medical complication and/or did not feel comfortable with the details of their own medical care.  PPA is a very large group practice with many moving parts and lack of continuity is a major weakness of large group practices as a model.  If you are not comfortable with this type of model dont go to PPA.  There are other, smaller, MFM practices out there that can give you the personal touch you desire.   I work in the medical field and felt comfortable relaying the details of my case to the physician i was seeing.  They do have your chart with them they just may not have reviewed it in detail before the appointment.  Any time i did have a question either generally speaking with multiple gestation or specific to my case they were able to answer the questions to my satisfaction.

Other perks of this practice is that at Banner Good Sam and at Scottsdale Shea (i think) they have 24 hour in house coverage. I landed in OB Triage at Good Sam at 32 weeks with concern for preterm labor and the PPA physician on call came and spoke to me personally and relayed the information to the office for my office visit the next day.  I was impressed and relieved by this type of physician coverage. When i give birth in the next few weeks it will be nice to know that there is already a doctor on call on the premises.

In short, PPA is an excellent choice for high risk pregnancy care if you are wiling to modify your schedule to show up in the morning to avoid wait times and if you are okay with some lack of continuity of care that in my opinion does not affect the quality of care which is outstanding."
5,"Looking for a place that is so off the beaten path that you need to drive down a neighborhood road to get to it. Well this is the place. Great food, friendly owners and a diner you will want to come back to."
1,"Terrible Meal!!!! Me And My Girl Had The Huaraches. Traditional Mexican Confort Food. First Off The Huarache Is Supposed To Be Fried, It Wasn't. Second The Meat Is Supposed To Be Suculently Delicious It Wasn't, For The Amount Of Time It Took To Cook, It Should Have. Third Is You Have To Pay Per Drink.

Fourth Service Was Mediocre And Last We Got Overcharged Even With The 20% Discount This App Offers. NEVER GOING BACK!!!!!"
5,"Smoky Jon's is absolutely the best barbeque joint in Madison, bar-none. 

The ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender and cooked to perfection, but their brisket is a real treat - slightly smokey with a seasoning that compliments their barbeque sauce amazingly.  Their meats are served with your choice of all the classic barbeque joint sides that you would expect - my favorites are the beans and the coleslaw, the latter of which is rich and creamy (not oily and bland like the ""Creamy Coleslaw"" at Brickhouse).

I'm astounded by the reviewers who prefer the likes of  Brickhouse BBQ or Famous Dave's to Smoky Jon's and can only assume that they have never had real Kansas City or Texas barbeque.  If you want authentic barbeque, nothing beats Smoky Jon's."
5,"This is a place that really helps a lot of women across the valley find direction and help during transitions in life. Whether you are new to the valley as I am or a long time resident they openly receive you and assist you. 
They offer short term programs to assist with finding resources for counseling, education, car repairs & transportation, interviewing, networking, resume writing, self esteem & empowerment, divorce workshops, housing, entering & returning to the workplace, the list goes on. 
They provide a clean, quiet & safe environment with some free daycare while using the resources at the location for all women, so as to minimize their worries and assist with getting them stabilized in the communities. 
It is the best such program, I have seen in any city and a beautiful environment as well."
1,"Brittany, you are a TERRIBLE waitress. You should find a job that doesn't involve customer service.

My friend and I were super excited today for Wing Wednesday ($9.99 all you can eat wings). We walk in and are greeted instinctively but the female bartender who also tells us to sit wherever. I choose a table next to the double doors that leads to the outside seating area. For 10 minutes we sat there without even so much as eye contact or a smile from any of the waitresses. I see that there are two moderate groups outside (6-8 people each), but don't give it a second thought. Still no acknowledgment from anybody. After 15 minutes, my buddy walks up two managers who were fiddling with a tv monitor and 3 other waitresses surrounding them. My buddy goes, ""Umm, can we get some service??"" The female manager immediately appoints someone to go to our table. 

This blondie informs us that **Brittany** is our waitress, but she would take our first order. A few minutes after she takes our order, the lovely Brittany shows up. We had already watched this girl walk right past our table about 10 times back and forth prior to talking to the managers. She apologizes, like a child whose been forced to do so, for ""not seeing"" us. A) Simple acknowledgment would have sufficed. B) My buddy is a BIG tall guy with a mohawk wearing a bright red shirt. How the heck could she not have seen us? She then makes a pathetic attempt to explain that she got slammed, and says that she will now take our order. I tell her that our orders have already been taken. We get our first round of wings in a fair amount of time after the order was put in by Blondie. I asked for ranch and never got it. My buddy's cajun wings were too salty so he only ended up eating 6 wings. Brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend's drink. He told her Mr. Pibb, and she brought back coke. She took his plate away and didn't bother to ask if he wanted more wings since it was all you can eat. He's a big guy!!! Oh that's right. She didn't take our order so of course she didn't know. Shortly after I finished my own round of wings. Typically, the girls will see that you have finished your wings halfway and immediately ask you if you want the next round put it. No one asked us this. So I finished my wings and asked my friend if he wanted to go or keep hoping that the service will improve. BTW, those big tables were long gone by then. It was actually pretty empty by then. The whole time we just watched Brittany try to calculate her tabs and collect her tips. 

My friend wanted out, and he said he'll refuse to pay if they asked us. We head straight to the door and NO ONE bothered trying to stop us. Instead we heard Brittany,""Sorry guys."" as we left. They knew what was going on. This is the very worst service that I have ever had. I would have still tipped had we stayed til the end, but it was so terrible. My wings weren't even that great. 

If you come here, and you get a girl that is tan, has shoulder length curly hair, and is named Brittany, ask for another waitress."
1,"Beer selection is ok. Good room for seeing bands - sound was great. However, majority of the male staff here is unapologetically rude & disrespectful. Aging sports neanderthals that could care less that you're there.  

Don't waste your time - spend your money at Mickey's Tavern or Crystal Corner instead."
1,"The customer service at the drive thru really is poor. I frequently go to this branch because it's the closest to my home, I go at least once a week. I've only been greeted and been told to have a great day once since May 2012 (when I started going to this branch). Today when I informed the teller that I was given someone else's receipt she didn't even say thank you or apologize for the mistake. Unfortunately, this is the only branch in my area so I have to ignore the poor drive thru service or tryout the inside service which is an inconvenience for me because I usually have my 1 year old son with me."
1,"If I could give the Harmony less than one star, I would. I live in the Shenk-Atwood neighborhood, so I'm not writing as an outsider. I've been to the Harmony many times, but I'm finally done being abused by the notoriously unfriendly owner, bartenders and waitstaff at the Harmony. The Harmony is worse than Seinfeld's Soup Nazi because there's no irony or humor in being treated the way the employees here treat their customers. 

I won't get into specifics. I can only say that I take pride in my neighborhood. My wife and I frequent those establishments that understand that they are part of a community and treat their paying customers as such. The Harmony is a black mark on our neighborhood, and I am ashamed that unsuspecting visitors to the quaint east side should have to endure the abusive, disrespectful and generally unapologetic service at this establishment. If you scroll down you'll read other comments about the owner's girlfriend who is now manager. The last time I was in there with a group of friends, she couldn't have been more rude or insulting. When we all said we wouldn't be back, she merely shrugged her shoulders. 

If you're visiting the East Side, there are plenty of other places that serve great food with friendly service. Alchemy, Mickey's, Wilson's, The Weary Traveller all come to mind as places that will make you feel and taste the love on the East Side.  If you're a masochist, be sure to head on over The Harmony for your daily dose of abuse. 

You've been warned. You certainly won't catch me sitting at this bar ever again."
5,"I loooooove this restaurant!! The food is fantastic, and the prices aren't bad as well! The location is a little scary (downtown Phoenix) but don't let that deter you from an awesome Mexican food experience!!!"
1,Have been eating here for 25 years. It used to my favorite place for barbecue. I ordered a half rack of ribs and the bones were soft and tasted awful. The waitress took it back to the cook. The cook said that happens sometimes and sent out two cold pieces of rib. I won't be going back sad to say.
5,"(This is the first time I felt the need to voice my opinion on yelp and this being such a personal matter, I hope it is useful to future women in my shoes).....As a first time expecting mom, this office has catered to all my obscure worries and fears with care. Always making me feel at ease and answering my questions to fulfillment. I had the unpleasant event of waking up with a kidney stone at 3 a.m. To make matters worse, try typing in ""contracting lower back pain, third trimester pregnancy,"" on the web, instant scare considering I am only 29 weeks. I  called the after hours number and my call was returned by Laura, literally within two minutes. She calmly instructed me to go down to maternal triage at my hospital. I was greeted by Dr. Thompson, who just so happened to be hanging out at the hospital at 4 am, and treated within 45 minutes of making my first call.  This experience alone makes me feel confident when I go into labor this Sept, I know I will have the support of the team as promised. That right there takes a load off my shoulders and gives me the opportunity to enjoy the last few months of pregnancy. 

Furthermore, all my appointments have been pleasant and timely, their follow-up is reliable, and the staff is very friendly. Reading another review regarding the lady at the front desk... Don't let her fool you. She is a sweetheart and you will grow to like her. Not being chatty Cathy doesn't mean she isn't helpful or good at her job. 

Moral of my review: They have done an excellent job handling a high-matainance, over-reacting, scared to pieces, mom-to-be. And I couldn't be more pleased."
5,Love this gym.  Very casual and comfortable and the locker rooms are well maintained and tidy.  A great way to spend my lunch hour.
1,"I went there with a coupon for BOGO buffets. My stomach wishes I hadn't. Some of it was better than other. The service was great. The cheese Enchiladas were disgusting. The Sopapillas were good, the icecream??? was funny tasting. With the coupon it was still about $17 for two with two softdrinks and a tip, so I say skip it and go somewhere else. Your stomach will thank you."
1,"I've been here so many times and I always get frustrated. The food and service have always been decent but the parking and food pickup situation are the worst in the valley. Its open parking out front then valet in back. Ive lived in Arcadia for years and have gotten a spot out front once. The valets are great but if you're just running in for 5 mins it adds another ten to get your car back. 
What frustrates me more than anything is there lobby/order pickup area. First they have crammed so many shelves full of rare peanut butters, custom greeting cards, children's educational toys, and hand made wine bottle holders that there is literally one small area for everyone to make an elementary school style line weaving through all this junk. Second, after ordering your $10 sandwich you are forced to wait in a crush of people all clamoring for their food. On more than one occasion my food has been taken by a hungry soccer mom or avid bicyclist in spandex. Then off to the cafeteria style seating to find a table. 
My problem is if your spending over $10 for their food items then they should give you a number to take to your table so its delivered, not fight cougars in a game of life and death for your meal. 
I'm over it."
1,Yucky greasy food.
5,I'm kind of biased as I love their peanut chicken and have for years. I haven't tried much else from their menu except the soup (which was also d'lish). My girlfriend tells me that their curry chicken is among the best she has ever had. I'll take her word for it as I hate curry.
5,"What makes Ranch Market so great is that it creates a fantastic experience for its customers. When you enter through the sliding doors for the first or thousandth time, you immediately understand what Ali Baba must have felt when he uttered, ""Open O Simsim"". For if you've entered through my favorite entrance (the West entrance), you'll be flanked by rows of 7' glass pillars filled with bejeweled pastries for sale.  The experience only gets better from there. Truly, Ranch Market is more of a destination for me and less of a stop. Highlights for me, include but are not limited to:

- having a smoothie made for you from fresh fruit and vegetables that are both peeled and pureed for you 
 - a produce area that reminds you of that great farmers market where the wooden carts are pilled high with produce so fresh you can feel the earth still holding on to the vegetables
 - fans dancing throughout the store with streamers hanging from their blades
 - a cafateria style food service area that rivals most modern mexican restaraunts
 - ceviche that both tastes like the ocean and smells like limes hanging on tree

1,"Asked sales associate if they match competitors prices and was told ""we don't have competitors"". We told him if that's the case then we'll just go back over to your competitor and buy from them."
5,The best!  They have been around a long time and have thrived when other rib places come and go. I make the long trip across town when I need a half-slab.
1,"Wow. Completely disappointed. I had the commuter. When did English muffins lose their crispness, holes and flavor. Not impressed at all."
1,"I used their catering services for a corporate training we were holding in our office. It was supposed to be delivered at noon. At 11:55, I received a call letting me know they were running a ""few minutes"" behind. Fast forward 35 minutes later, I am sitting on hold with them for 10 minutes trying to find out where our food is. The gal on the phone was rude and acted like I was out of line by asking where it might be.

I guess I just assumed a chain as large as CPK would have their act together when it comes to these things. Instead they didn't offer an apology or ANYTHING. We definitely won't be using them for corporate catering again, or anything else for that matter."
5,"I've been here a few times and each time was amazing! 
The pad Thai is worth writing home about and the temple of fire has just the right amount if spice.

Not only is the food, good it is also consistent. The service is friendly and never keeps you waiting too long!"
1,Just left early from Arizona Opera Lucia Di Lammermoor. It was horrible. I felt like I was at a high school production! Their is no sound production and the performers do not wear mikes. So you are in a fairly large hall (the symphony hall to be exact) and all you can hear are these tiny voices from the stage. I could've had the same experience watching it on my IPad. DO NOT waste your hard earned money. They should be ashamed to pretend this is a true opera!
5,"Just a quick update to let people know that they now serve alcohol! Woohoo! They got their liquor license six weeks ago -- after a tedious process, they said -- and now have a full menu of wines and other libations (Beer and Sake that I know of).  So, next time you want to cruise downtown to listen to some great live music, have some fantastic grub and enjoy the cool atmosphere, you can do so with some wine and beer too!"
1,Worst place I have ever lived. No water half the time. No A/C the other time. The staff is here to make sure they get paid only and do not care about your problems.  I can't wait to move.
5,"Loved this place! They had great sushi and amazing service. Although we didn't know it we came in close to closing time but never felt rushed. It wasn't until we started talking with the owner that we found out the closed 30 min ago! However, he took extra time just to talk with us about his sushi, business and Phoenix. Can't wait to go back and chat with Seth!"
5,This has absolutely become my favorite bar in Phoenix. There are some weeks that I go multiple times. The atmosphere is so relaxed and inviting. Whether you want to dance and dip or unwind after a long day you can do either here! Will always be my number one choice!
1,"My son likes to go there for poppers on the weekend.  His second choice is the chocolate chip coffee cake.  This is the second weekend in a row that they have been out of both.   The first time, I thought it was a fluke.  Two weekends in a row is a trend.  If you run out of something daily, make more of it.  Obviously, there's now more of a demand for both of these.  You can make more of them to meet the demand or don't and demand will go down from people like me not coming back to your store.  Dunkin Doughnuts, here we come again!"
1,"Last week I went on yelp to find a good alterations place to fix two pairs of pants and a shirt of mine. Creations & Alterations had some good reviews and it was down the street from my apartment. I dropped off my clothes thinking it wouldn't take more than 2-3 days. I dropped it off on a Tuesday and they told me it'd be ready the NEXT week Thursday!! At the time I didn't care and just wanted it done. I came in the next week Friday morning before I drove out to California, intending to wear my newly fixed jeans, and they said it wasn't ready. They hadn't even started on it. They asked if I could spare an hour for them to fix it, which just added insult to injury being informed that they sat on my clothes for a week and a half when everything could have been taken care of in an hour. I asked for my clothes back and will NEVER come back again. 0 stars."
1,"I hate this CVS with a passion. There are always people hanging outside begging for money. Sometimes, CVS allows these fundraiser groups to hang outside their door and ask you for money on your way in/out. I normally wouldn't care, but I'm not handing cash to a cheerleader to go to camp when there are children dying of cancer that could use the money more. Just saying. 

Anyway, back to the panhandlers. About a year ago, I was coming out of this CVS and heading to the bus stop. As I turned the corner, a guy approached me asking for money and before i could answer, he pulled out a knife. Luckily, I was able to run to the bus stop and the bus came right then. I was pretty shaken up because it was summertime and nobody was really around in that area (it was by the drive thru pharmacy). That evening, I decided to call the store and ask to speak to a manager to address their issues with people begging for money. Not only did I get an attitude, but the lady from the description of the guy that I gave her, seemed to know exactly who this person was (described him as a regular customer). She defended him by saying that it didn't sound like something he'd do. Um, excuse me? I was able to give her the exact time according to her that he is around CVS, a description, etc. Why would I lie about this? So a simple task like keeping panhandlers away was proven to be too difficult for CVS to handle and their managers could care less about their customers."
1,"I took my baby here based on reviews.  Well, it just goes to show that Yelp doesn't always work.  I gave my girl some med's. and she was having side effects ( loss of appetitite, diarrhea, lethargy), also she was bowled over by a larger puppy at the dog park and seemed sore.  The amazingly pompous Dr. Bishop ignored all of my concerns.  Instead (yet again, he's the SIXTH vet who's done this) he started hammering on about her cough and how it means she's in heart failure.  Is she on med's.?  No, but she had an echo cardiogram less than a year ago and she doesn't need med's.  I again voiced the concerns I came in about.  He said he knows nothing about the med's. I gave my dog (Really?  Corticosteroids, and a vet knows nothing about THAT?).   He didn't care about her symptoms and dismissed them other than ""feed her rice and beef or chicken for now"".  Then went on about how he NEEDS to run a battery of tests on her and take numerous X-ray's of her.  I said ""No"", he will not do that, I only allow trusted specialists, i.e. a heart specialist to do that, since reg. vet's tend to be wrong (SIX of them in my experience so far).  He got snippy and said he'd send me to a specialist he knows. Yeah, right.  Again, he wanted to run tests on her to see if she could handle his (extremely outdated) treatments WHEN (not IF) HIS specialist finds problems with her heart.  I told him she already had blood tests, etc. four months ago.  NO, they must have them done again.  Money grubber, anyone?  Then, he said she has blood in her eye and pointed to the WHITE film over it as proof.  I said nothing but I had her eyes examined only FOUR days before going to him, and the WHITE FILM IS A CATARACT. In addition, he never really noticed her, or looked her over, and was very unfriendly and cold toward her.  Even to the point that even though this frail, frightened, blind and tiny girl almost fell off his table while right next to him, he didn't bat an eye.  Couldn't be bothered with holding her or catching her.  Luckily his much nicer tech. did.  I can only imagine the office got friends and family to write good reviews.  He is now in my top three list of the worse vets I ever encountered.  Hey, if a vet doesn't even listen to why you're actually there, and doesn't know about the side effects of a common drug, what good can you say?  Also, tip to pet parents, he's also the third vet I've encountered who has a question on the form you fill out, that basically asks how much money you're willing to spend on your pet.  Wanna bet that's the first thing they look at?  Every vet I've encountered who has this question ended up being a rip off.  From now on I'll run out of the office as soon as I see that question."
5,"Can't do animals, can't do dairy, yet am a food warrior. Indeed, Madison abounds with options for a gal like me, but Monty's marks my favorite eatery in the city. Intentionally old-school in its decor and prices, it's a throwback that appeals to anyone with a frontal cortex. 
My waitress brought me a gratis cup of the home-made veg soup as I was sitting at the end of the counter an she hadn't seen me for a few minutes (aaaaand the tip started to go up).  I had the meatless meatloaf thing also mentioned here, and good LORD the portion size was outta control. The roll was the size of a Yorkshire pudding and the mashed potatoes were actually made of potato, fancy that. The meatless loaf itself was solidly good (shredded root veg with a cheesy binder - wish I had known that prior to ordering, but should've asked) but a bit oily and the cashew gravy was goooood. So many great-looking options for veg-heads like myself, hallelujah a-MEN, and they even have a small wine list and beer. 
I couldn't get through the entire pile of food, despite being a hormonal food warrior that day, yet I craved a sweet and Monty's has soy ice cream. WTF, OTHER DINERS? I nearly wept at this one. I had the mint chip, 2 scoops, which again were more like two grapefruit spilling over the sides of the bowl. That, I could do. 
My total bill came to $8. EIGHT. I added a 50% tip and blew Monty's a kiss as I left; I shall RETURN! Waitress was a sweetie, the staff all seemed to be pretty happy, and the place was approaching fullness when I left. 
My fondness for Monty's justifies the caps."
1,Business is closed. Signs at front indicate its for sale & phone is disconnected
1,"My rating used to be four stars, yes that's four stars. I wouldn't even give this ONE star now.

Living here has turned out to be a complete nightmare. They are not military friendly at all, they claim to be. We are in TX on orders, they assured us they would renew our lease over and over including several times in September, October, November and December when we inquired about terminating our lease for military orders. We were repeatedly reassured that it would not be an issue to renew in April (while we would still be gone). However, in February, after swindling us for 7 months of extra rent, they informed us they would not be renewing our lease. Fine, their prerogative in the end (although I was BEYOND ticked over this). Now they have been giving ""notices"" to enter our apartment while we're gone even though every single person in their office is full aware that we're in TX and they can't be bothered to send an email to actually make 24 hours notice. 

Carla in the front office is great and Mike who heads up maintenance is a saint, but otherwise, the staff here is AWFUL, the walls are thin, the rules are not enforced for quiet time, smoking policy or anything else listed in the lease except when they want to harass you and take advantage. 

I would hope that any decent person is able to stay clear of this apartment complex!"
5,"Wild red flight with cheese!  Try it. Helpful staff, very friendly, especially Todd and Drew."
1,"Tried to go here twice, both on Friday nights.  They were closed at 9:00 on one Friday night.  The second Friday night, we got there at 6:30 and were told the grill was closed because 'it had to cool down for an hour before they closed.'  So bizarre.

Once you learn it used to be a carwash, you'll have a hard time imagining it any other way."
5,We were craving authentic breakfast burritos. This place was perfect. The chorizo  was magnificent. Mmmmm. I'll be coming back.
1,"Well where to start... my friends and I were walking past when 2 men approached us and one said, ""Hi, I'm Jason Cheuvront,"" which we thought was really tacky.  Once in the restaurant a hostess asked us if we wanted a table and how many in our party; she then walked away and did not return, so we had to seat ourselves.  We ordered happy hour drinks, and the glass of wine I ordered tasted like vinegar and smelled spoiled.  When I told our server he said, ""I won't smell it because I don't like to tell customers that they are wrong."" I was so shocked by his response that I did not order another drink.  The server took the glass of wine back behind the bar, and we then saw the owners and bartenders trying the wine and rolling their eyes.  Later, the server returned and told me I could order any drink, not just something off the happy hour menu, (wasn't sure if it would be on the house or not?) and then never returned to take my order. When we finally tracked down another server, I ordered a sangria.  The server gave me a blank stare and said they did not have sangria even though it was plainly listed on their drink menu.  Enough was enough!  We left cash on the table and left."
5,"This place is great, only problem I had was deciding what yo eat.  You walk in and the smell of great food over comes you.  Staff was very helpful and the food was very good and lots to choose from, everyone in our party was please with their lunch."
1,"Greasy food, lazy service, flat soda.  For a place the is supposed to specialize in burgers they sucked!  The patty was dry and over cooked everything was greasy, and the only thing that was ok were the fries but that is not a reason to go."
1,"had been going there when it was a seedy place, knife fights in the bathroom, someone macing someone by the pool table and weekly fights that went from one side of the bar to the other, and drug use like crazy with prositution behind the dumpsters, the bathrooms are awful the womens bath room is always dirty and for some odd reason the toliet seats go missing,  only time to enjoy it was with Devina when the customers seemed to behave, then WA LA here comes Mia to replace the friday shows that  brought the decent customers, no more fights but only those who wanted to have fun, no more were the trannie chasers lurking in the shadows and always a full house, they made so much money they added a smoking patio, bigger dressing room, bigger stage, and better guests now that it has improved other queens started coming, now the mgt thinks its better to replace Mia, now instead of a full house you can hear the crickets, you are now getting old drag with the same old routines, the workers and new host will lie and say Mia will be there so people will stay, if you have to lie just to get someone elses fans you should look at yourself and see what you are doing wrong, we are no longer going on fridays, we have been loyal customers for 5 years and its a shame mgt doesnt care about their workers or what their customers want we are now going to FREAKY FRIDAYS at FRIENDS AGAIN"
1,"My current roommate and I recently moved into these apartments after being recommended from one of our close friends who had also recently moved in. Since none of us have ever lived here before, we did not know that the website was filled with lies and illusions. Though on the outside the complex appears cheery, the people in the office are less then subpar. hey have the customer service skills of a rock. Upon moving in, my roommate and I began to experience loud noises and fighting coming from our neighbors on the 3rd floor. The fight literally lasted from 1:00AM -5:00AM. I woke up for work (tired from the lack of sleep) and they were STILL fighting. It sounded like a girl and a guy were really having some relationship issues. I let it go and continued on to work. 

The next night  the fighting continued. Now it sounded like it was getting violent with shouts like ""YOU HIT ME FIRST,"" and ""I WILL PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE."" I could not take it anymore and decided to call the police. At 2:45AM on a Wednesday I called the police to file a noise complaint. The operator was extremely nice for the early hour and sent 2 officers out. After about 20-30 minutes I hear loud knocking on the door above me. Finally the yelling stopped and I was able to get some sleep (Thanks to Phoenix's Finest). The next night the fighting continued and so did the loud bangs and booms. When I say loud noises, I am talking about ""booms"" so loud that our windows shook in the bedrooms. It sounded like bowling balls were being thrown around...or bodies. My roommate came into my room to see if I was awake and to no surprise I was already staring at the ceiling seeing red. We decided to call the police again at around the usual 2:45AM time. This time we requested for the cop to come down to our place and report what they discussed with the inconsiderate neighbors. After dozing in and out trying to stay awake about an hour and a half later we decided that we couldnt wait for the police any longer and fell asleep. I was jolted awake when i heard a loud knock on our front door. I hopped out of bed and walked towards the front, my roommate quickly stopped me and said that was not the cop. She said that the knock did not sound like a cop's knock. Before I could look through the peep hole we then heard through the door ""OPEN UP, WE KNOW YOU CALLED THE COPS."" it was our lovely neighbors paying us a visit. Again they continued on saying ""IF YOU HAVE THE BALLS TO CALL THE COPS YOU SHOULD HAVE THE BALLS TO OPEN THE DOOR."" The knocking continued for another 7-10 minutes and progressively became louder and louder. We then heard one of the guys run  up and down the stairs screaming and banging on other tenants doors in a fit of rage that the police were called on them. My roommate and I never went back to sleep and drove around from 6:00AM-9:00AM to wait for the office to open. When the office opened we went in to let them know about the insane madness that went on during the night. Let's not forget I had to call out of work and miss out on an opportunity to make money. The office could care less and did absolutely nothing. With the exception of one employee, CJ, the office employees have no sense of how to treat a person. The manager, Lisa,  was the worst of all. She spoke over me, made me seem like i was blowing things out of proportion and when I stated how upset it made me feel she followed by stating ""we have all gone through difficult things in our life."" 

Currently as it stands my roommate and I have been here for about 4 months and are still dealing with the horrible neighbors. I have been called a ""bitch"" by one of them while walking to my car, the noise will not stop and is still causing us sleepless nights, our complaints are left unheard and unnoticed, it is flat out miserable. The 2 of the neighbors have moved out but now the one left has his friends staying with him and they make more noise then ever. Our place is absolutely miserable. Our door is constantly being knocked on and just tonight the neighbors jiggled the handle while we were sitting in the living room watching TV. We have become a joke to them because they know the office will not do anything. they could care less about the people who live here and I have never lived in a place that was so disrespectful to their tenants. We have gone to everyone working in there and they all act like their hands are tied. It's pathetic. The last person I spoke with today stated that if we wait a week ""things should work out themselves."" when i asked for the number to the customer relations to file a complaint, she basically told me that it would not do any good and refused to give it to me. 

Whatever you do DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! It is not worth it. They make you sign a 15 month lease and trap you in with unpleasant people both in the office and living around you. This is also in a crap neighborhood. You dont feel safe, regardless of the ""dummy"" cop car parked in front, it's not fooling anyone."
1,"Mid century furniture is supposed to be warm, welcoming, and approachable. Not here. Almost every piece of furniture had a sign on it: ""do not touch"" or ""do not sit"". It felt more like an overpriced museum. 

When I asked the owner about all the signs, she said ""I don't go to a luxury car dealership and sit in all the cars I can't afford. People who buy a really nice piece of furniture here don't want something that everyone has sat their butt on."" I'll never waste my time there again."
5,"Get your passport, we're going to Mexico.

Can't find your passport?  Still waiting for it from the State Department?  No worries, pack your bag and head to the Ranch Market!

This place is the best!  The food court is wonderful with so many tasty dishes.  And the produce department is crazy!  2 lbs of grapes for 99 cents, 8 cucumbers for a dollar, 17 cents for a bunch of cilantro, 7 -- YES, SEVEN pounds of watermelon for 99 cents.  You can go crazy with produce and not break the bank.  

The tamales are huge and the tortillas, oh the tortillas. 

Don't be frightened, don't get intimidated, it's just a grocery store people!"
1,Can I give it no stars? Worst gym. Cardio equipment is old and usually broken. Everything usually broken. Staff sucks. Center caps from my wheels were stolen from the crappy parking lot.
1,I got sick eating this food.. DONT EAT HERE.. my wifes co workers had the same experience
1,"Waited over an hour to be seated just to see people who got here after us get a table...yeah the girl crossed us off the list for no reason. Noobs at the bar left us waiting to pay for the drinks we got while we were waiting, and then when we finally get seated guess what, it's another hour wait for our pizza.... Could have told us that before the first hour!!! Save yourself the 2 hours of waiting and go to Pizza Hut, you'll be much less dissatisfied. I would give this place zero stars if I could."
1,We had special ordered doors which were delivered late. We received no notice that there would be a delay and calls to the millwork department went unanswered or a long time was spent on hold waiting for someone to be tracked down. In-person visits were very stressful because there was never enough staff in the department and oftentimes there was no one around at all. Overall we've not had problems with the store but after the experience we had with the millwork department it is doubtful we will ever return.
5,"Central UMC is a wonderful church, combining worship with beautiful art and song. I've only ever been to the 11:00 am service, which features traditional worship hymns and liturgy, and communion on the first Sunday of the month. There are also services at 8 and 930 I believe. The 930 service features more contemporary music.  

A few things really stand out about this church. First, the music. The volunteer choir performs breathtaking choral pieces every Sunday. Even after attending this church for a year, I'm constantly impressed by the skill of the choir, soloists and organist. The service commonly features guest musicians such as the Sonoran Brass Quintet.  

Secondly, the current pastor, Pastor Larry gives great, contemplative sermons that really parse the text of the scripture. The staff and congregation are always friendly and welcoming, and the church is involved with several charitable works in the community, such as the Justa Center  

Finally, the premises are beautiful. The main Sanctuary is adorned with beautiful stained glass religious artwork. The church is also home to two beautiful organs.  

I'd encourage anyone looking for a church to try Central UMC."
1,After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Don't waste your time here.
5,"I'm a Madison native and usually stay with my parents. But this trip for a family funeral called for a hotel. We figured we might end up staying a week (eventually did eight nights) so wanted something more homelike with a separate bedroom and living area. And we wanted to do it economically. The Grandstay was perfect and well under neighboring Staybridge, Residence Inn and others.

We had never heard of the chain before and found it on Expedia. It was perfect. Every single staff person we encountered all week made us feel at home. Anything we needed was taken care of. 

Being primarily a longstay hotel, you don't see a lot of the guests. We actually went a few days before seeing anyone else on our schedule. We felt like we owned the place. 

The lobby became our living room, with a nice fireplace and overstuffed chairs. The breakfast room was perfect for gathering with friends who also came in for a few nights. The pool was the highlight for our local grandaughter who came to visit.

We stayed in a one-bedroom suite. I also checked out the two-bedroom and one-room suites. The rooms were all decent size and very comfortable. Kitchenettes featured a full-sized refrigerator, cooktop, dishwasher and microwave.

Rooms include a complimentary breakfast with a wide range of choices including hot waffles.

The location is outstanding, with easy access to the freeway. It was 10 minutes to the airport, 15 minutes to downtown. There are lots of really good restaurant choices at nearby East Towne, and a fabulous sports bar (Pooleys) just a block away.

Thanks to the management for a great stay. We would absolutely make this our permanent stop in Madison next time."
1,i have never been treated so rude. owner has anger issues! do not give this store your business.
5,"If only I had the money to buy some of the stuff at Red Modern Furniture... Regardless, this store has some of the nicest pieces of furniture I've seen. What's more is that it's all vintage, so you know you're getting the real thing and not some retro copy. You can really tell that they take their time and use a critical eye with what pieces they choose to restore and sell. I have no problem with sounding pretentious here, but the furniture they have in stock truly are pieces of design art. If you can afford what they have to offer, buy it. If not, feel free to peruse around the store as though it were a museum. I used to live in LA and there were places like this in Silverlake, Melrose, etc., but none of them had the selection or quality that this store did.

The owner here is really cool and encourages you to look around even if they know that you probably can't afford anything there (like they did with me). Another thing about the owner at Red Modern Furniture is that she's really passionate about what she does and I thought that it was really cool that I could talk to her about what was in the store."
5,"I walked by this gym many times thinking it was mostly a boxing place because that's what you see from the street but in the back of the boxing rings is where all the cardio and weight machines are. This is a super cool, friendly, neighborhood gym. No frills but everything you need is there. Staff is super helpful and easily approachable, always goes out of their way to make you comfortable and at ease. They have the typical cardio stuff and tons of weight stuff, also a tanning bed and tanning sessions are priced right. No signup, enrollment or membership fees, and no contracts ! I also appreciated the lack of sales pitch, no hard sell here ! As a female member I feel totally safe in there, the East Side location and parking are convenient, and the neighborhood is very cool."
5,"The produce in American grocery stores looks perfect but has no discernible taste, The produce in Mexican markets has gouges, bruises and imperfections, but tastes wonderful. 

Priorities.

The place is vibrant with life that you don't get in any American-style grocery. It's a feast for the senses. 

Don't expect fast or snappy service at the lunch counter. There's usually a line. Knowing Spanish helps a bit, but there's usually someone around who can translate. For your patience you will be rewarded with the real tastes of Mexico: The gristle of lengua, the insanely savory flavor of the carnitas, the wonderful aroma of the barbacoa.

Just go. Pick up some real tortillas and some Coke in real glass bottles too. It's still made with sugar, dontchaknow?"
1,"I brought my mini schnauzer here  for grooming and I was not at all impressed. I had been here once before and everything turned out really well, but something clearly has changed. My appt was for 8am and I was there right on time only to find the doors still locked and no employee in sight. When the person finally arrived he asked how I wanted her cut to look and I specifically explained that they can trim her beard but should, for the most, part leave it long...she's a schnauzer, he confirmed and told me she would be ready in 2-3 hours. Not too bad I thought, although last time it literally only took an hour, but I decided I would go across the street to sbux and relax while I waited. Fast forward 4 hours and I still had not received a call to let me know my dog was done. I decided at that point to go back and check to see what her status was. Upon arriving the lady grooming her told me she would need an additional 20-25 min, so again I waited and we left about 30 min later. I noticed at that point Gigi's beard was a little too short for my liking but figured it would grow. It wasn't until I got home and really looked at her that I noticed her beard was completely crooked...wth?! and they left two huge knots of matted fur on the underneath part of her tail. Granted the rest of her cut looked great, but what the heck were you doing for an additional 2 hours with my dog....with that amt of time she shouldve looked perfect. I will not be back to Poochie's ever again."
1,"Horrendous.  It is near my house so I stop in ever once in a while and every time and I tell myself it is the last time.  The place is a mess all of the time, the shoppers are rude and let their kids run all over the store.  Some of the staff seem a little nicer than they used to be.  If I could find some good deals I might keep going back, but TJ Maxx's is getting all of my $$."
5,"Update: I was contacted by the museum regarding my visit and they cleared up the problem with the security guard. I was very impressed at the amount of care that they took in addressing my situation. 

I rarely attend museums, but decided to go because the girlfriend wanted to. I'm an acrylic painter and all the art on display was beautiful and varied. The building itself was gorgeous. The only problem I had was the security guards. We were constantly followed by a heavyset black man and stared at regardless of where we went. I believe in no way did we look suspicious, had the guest stickers visible. We were just two people looking at some great art. Yet, he was hovering around enough to spoil the experience for us."
1,"So, the way I figure it, a 24/7 gas station/deli should be open, hmmmmmm, let me think, 24/7?  I'll give you Christmas; they could reasonably closed on Christmas.  Not New Years, people are hung over or just getting out of jail/back from Vegas, so, open New Years.   But yesterday?  


                              April 21, 2013, CLOSED!  9:54pm, CLOSED.  NOT OPEN

Oh well.

NOTE TO OWNER OF MARYLAND DELI AND LIQUOR, AKA: 7TH STREET SHELL STATION: BAD BUSINESS, PAL.  BAD BUSINESS.  I'LL NEVER COME BACK TO OVERSPEND ON EVERYTHING, (which if they are open, it's a convenience I'll pay for) TO NOW FIND YOU CLOSED!~  The only reason I've paid your prices in the past is because you were a good last resort.  Now you're just ""last"".

Note to self: never go here again.  Tell 100 friends to never go here again, how they just ""take off"" on a Sunday night.  That's called word-of-mouth, pal, and you or your ""gone fishin' "" staff just earned some muy, muy mal word-of-mouth."
5,"Oh my jesus is this place fantastic. I experienced Ranch Market for the first time last summer. I'm not familiar with the holiday, but it's the one where they bake tons of cakes with little babies in them..? Someone help me here. Back to the point, it was EXTREMELY festive, and I don't know if it was the heat, or that I was tired, or that the place was just so decked out in colors and people and decorations, but I got sick. Sick to where I had to wait outside by the car for my company. Hilarious. Needless to say I was a little frightened, so it took a little while for the curiosity to pique again. 

Second time was yesterday evening. Perhaps it was because instead of being a busy Saturday it was a slower (still busy, though) Tuesday that I was able to survive this visit. The boy decided to use it for a school project so I tagged along to see if I could help. The second we walked in the door however, all hope in my helping him was lost. My mind was in a frenzy as I decided where to stop first. The Jugeria for some Horchata? Or the restaurant for some asada? Or maybe the bakery for something sweet...? 

Found out the Horchata is way too sweet (but delicious) to drink alone so I shared with the boy. Grabbed some kind of sweet roll from the bakery that we practically fought over...and oh my! It was Taco Tuesday at the restaurant! I ordered 4 asada tacos for $2.99 and thanked the lord my boy is a vegetarian. Best carne asada ever! 

And the atmosphere in here is great. Oh! And they're open late. 6a-11p. The employees are friendly and the customers (mainly families) are just so full of life and happiness (or maybe it was the Spanish music blaring on the loudspeaker?). All in all, this is a new fave. I will most definitely be looking into more of the daily specials and sweet rolls."
1,"Pros: cheap gas

Cons: I drive a high performance car and the manufacturer recommends only premium gas. I thought I was buying that from Costco. Turns out I wasn't. My car mechanic told me that my engine was full of deposits left by poor quality gas. The check engine light came on. Costco buys their gases from whoever is offering the lowest prices (savings they pas on to their customers). I guess that's fine for a regular car, but not for mine."
5,"My favorite lunch place downtown! Stick to any of the pastrami or corn beef sandwiches. My personal favorite is the New Yorker. Pastrami (or corned beef if you prefer) with cole slaw and russian dressing..mmm. Their other sandwiches are pretty good too (I've gotten a turkey sandwich that was good and the deli chix sandwich was ok). 

Now, you have to be on your toes when ordering as they move pretty fast, which is understandable considering the big lunch line. Fries are the default and you have to speak up if you want something else. Mac and cheese is good. Salad and fruit are good options if you're trying to mitigate the damage done to your diet from the sandwich.  

I also like all the historical photos of downtown Phoenix and the owners' story. Mix of all different business types, lawyers, etc.. Makes downtown Phoenix feel like a real downtown."
5,"This is where I take my 5-series BMW for service and I have been very pleased.  Friendly, honest, and they take pride in their work.  I have recommended them to friends and business associates that have foreign luxury autos as that is their specialty.  

I also bought a set of Nokian All-Season hybrid (winter/summer combination) tires from them two or three years ago on their recommendation and they are the best tires I've ever owned.  Highly recommend Dunn's."
1,"Not only is the food overpriced and barely edible, the service is horrible! For the money, if you really need a chain restaurant, head down the road to Chilli's."
5,"we love this place!  it's our ""go-to"" in Madison.  ALWAYS very very very clean, the staff is extremely friendly, and the rooms are modern and comfortable.  the rates are very reasonable, borderline cheap, and it is only about a ten minute drive from downtown."
1,"Wouldnt even rate then as 1 star but yelp wont let me dk anytjing less than that. 

To start Don't waste your time or money ordering ANYTHING from Full Compass. I recently made a large purchase from their website which took over four hours of my time back and forth with their ""customer service"" sales rep. Not only will they not allow you to ship to a business address they flat out won lt ship the package to any where but your on file billing address.
And further more they couldn't en provide me with a tracking number for my package. I paid for the shipping, it's only natural I get to be informed or aware of when FedEx will be delivering it to me!!! This is one of their illegible polices is the only explain soon I've received, why would anybody give someone payment for sometime that you can even track it's arrival. I'm over it. I will not do business with this company in the future and I would advise anyone else to do the same.
Save youraelf the frustration and time!"
1,"Very poorly kept, poor selection of animals, all of which looked miserable and very dirty. There was not a single exhibit that I thought was well maintained with happy animals. The ground squirrels living near the zoo were more fun to watch than the actual animals in the zoo. They also make you pay extra for anything extra.  A regular ticket doesn't include much except walking around.  They would charge you extra to sneeze if they could."
5,"So you wonder, (as you wander) does Phoenix have any history that pre-dates 1911? What happened to all the old brick and western style buildings that housed, cotton, supplies, cactus jelly, or whatever Phoenix would have had stored in a warehouse in 1911?  Well this is a place that has history (albeit, only 80 years or so, but hey we'll take it.) Coming from Boston, I yearn to have some kind of architectural history, buildings that have meaning, purpose,  character. I mean how many adobe style, clay shingled buildings can we have seriously? 

So if your looking for cool atmosphere, a safe venue (well lite parking lots) and great music, check out the brick house. I saw Okkerivil River here, and the experience was great, and the venue is the perfect size for a small show. They serve a wide range of beer and drinks. (food too) My only complaint, it was pretty hot inside, but then again it's ALWAYS hot inside buildings here in September. 

Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
1,"We took a client to Hillstone for dinner. The place is beautiful and the service was great. The food was slightly better than bar food, but certainly not worth the prices they are charging. If you are an advocate of fine dinning: you will be sorely disappointed.  

Go there for drinks, enjoy the gorgeous ambiance, but go somewhere else for a nice dinner.

I had the Cod special of the day, thirty minutes after eating my stomach started feeling queazy and at 5am I was woken by uncontrollable......food poison symptoms! There were four other members of our party and their stomachs were fine, but they were not overly impressed with their meals. Everyone did enjoy the atmosphere."
5,"I have worked downtown at the Arizona Center for over 4 years. We have a cafeteria here in our building and several other restaurant options at the Arizona Center.  I consistently go to Mi Amigo's for lunch.  I could eat there every day and never get tired of the food.  Their menu offers many great selections for lunch, dinner and/or Happy Hour.  The food is delicious and the chips and salsa are usually what entice me to to eat there more than once in a week.  If by Friday of each week, I haven't been there, I tell my co-workers that ""I need my fix"" and they know exactly what I mean.  Every waiter/waitress is so pleasant.  They are all so accommodating, full of smiles, and they make our lunch experience great EVERY SINGLE TIME!  We enjoy the outdoor seating when the weather is nice.  There are affordable lunch options, and if you don't like something, they'll gladly make you something else you want.  And lastly, Chris, the day manager, ROCKS!  :-)"
1,What's with long lines to get breakfast! Very disappointing.
5,"Highly recommended if you are in the Phoenix area!

I am going to visit again, the next time I am in town."
1,This location is evil with an evil owner named John and a useless manager named Kimberley.  I would rather watch wallpaper dry tbs. have to deal with this store for anything!!!  This location needs to be shut down.
5,"I was really surprised to see the poor reviews on yelp for Revolution! They have always been friendly and helpful when I have a need for my bike. However, those reviews seem to be from older dates (most of them..), so perhaps there's a management change and please give revolution a chance!!

The bike shop is a middle-sized shop, so they might not have as much variety of products as other huge bike shops. The nice thing is, they are willing to go out of the way to order something for you, even if you just wanted one piece of something. Also, it is a great place to stop by for last minute maintenance, quick fixes. They usually have a long wait for huge project fix ups, but if you just need a quick check or putting on a saddle, something fast, they will do it on the spot and you won't run into the long wait time.

I trust them to do a good job for my bike. Jacob, who I regularly see in the bike shop, was very detailed in explaining my options when I wanted to add gears to my single speed bike. He even suggested maybe building a custom bike might be something I should consider since my Sanwa is not exactly meant for touring.. A week and a half later (I was out of town), my bike was ready. It fits well, the gears are surprisingly smooth for a no gear gal like me. Everything was great! And they were so friendly and told me I should come back for a check up on the bike a week or two later!"
1,"Damn, I thought after all the hoopla this place was supposed to have the BEST chicken fried steaks in Phoenix....IT DOESN T...now I m from Texas and in all my 62 years , i have not had a more greasy,soggy,limp chicken fried steak....YUCK...what a load of crap this thing was. The rest of the place was a  dump..the bathroom had to be shared with employee changing his clothes...small is the word...I would bet you if Gordon Ramsey or the health dept inspected this dump the kitchen would be closed first thing....save your money and time, go back to Texas every now and then, go to the Market Diner on Harry Hines in Dallas and eat a REAL GOOD chicken fried  steak with fresh cream gravy and not that congealed goo from the texaz GRILL...I have had better from roadside vendors but nothing worse than the imitation chicken fried steak this place serves instead.....lazy @#$%'s"
5,"I am not a huge Teriyaki fan and this place was coming up as a sushi place on Yelp for a while now but was always closed. As most of you know, there are barely any sushi places down town so when I was home for the week last week I finally had the chance to head out to this place.

I wasn't disappointed that there was barely any sushi, I decided to go with the beef teriyaki instead. Holy smokes! Super yum! I haven't had teriyaki that was this good, ever!.

I will go back more and more and stuff myself silly. Love it.

I highly recommend it."
5,"My wife and I ended up here because it had outdoor seating and was happy to accommodate our dogs.  It had excellent service.  The food was fantastic.  The plates we had were simple fare with exceptional ingredients.  The chef did a wonderful job mixing and balancing flavors.  Even the bar tender nailed the Bellini's. It is very reasonable priced by which I mean a good, long dinner (2 hours+) for two with appetizer and drinks will probably come to about $100.  It is worth it!  If just having dinner and a glass of wine expect somewhere closer to $50-$60.  This is a great place to dine!"
5,"My wife and I have three dogs! A one year old German shepherd mix, a one year pitbill mix, and a 12 weeks old shar pei mix! We love going to Ryan's to get things for our little pack!
It is a warehouse packed with pet supplies! What could be better?! The staff is very friendly and eager to help. They also have any type of toy, crate, outfit, whatever your pet needs are! 
I recommend Ryan's to anyone who loves well priced pet supplies. Because being a pet owner is not always cheap!"
5,By far my favorite restaurant in the valley. Great food and staff with enough bang for your buck. if you are unsure of what to order you really can't go wrong with a classic!
5,"Just an amazing collection of Native American art and artifacts anywhere. The Heard Museum is a must visit if in the Phoenix area.

You can easily walk around here and explore all the exhibits and after a few hours still not have seen it all. So many different tribes are represented here. Baskets, bowls, artwork, clothing, dolls, ceremonial outfits, kachinas, and more from many tribes are on display.

What is impressive is that most of the pieces on display are donated by private collectors. Senator Barry Goldwater's collection of about 400 kachinas were donated and on display among many others who gave to the museum. There are also free hourly tours by knowledgeable museum staff. There is even a children's area with hands on crafts, exhibits, and learning tools. 

The layout of the museum is very open and thought provoking, the exhibits are displayed well, and the staff helpful. On site terrific cafe, gift/book store, and coffee shop too. Definitely a must to see if interested in Native American cultures, art, and history."
5,"Kicking it up a star because draaaanks are cheap, service it bomb and food is consistently tay-hay-sty."
5,Food is always great tasting and ready in no time! Also they have a great variety of pastas and sandwiches.  Can't say enough about how awesome this place is!
1,The worst customer service I have experienced in my life. How is it possible you are even in business?
5,"Awesome staff, great food and cool decor"
1,"Awful, awful, awful...  The worst of the worst of the cookie-cutter Chinese restaurants.  Food without flavor, a menu without imagination and a staff of such profound indifference it's hard to tell they're even there."
1,"Update 3/22/12 - Judy B. has deleted the review.

Update 3/19/12 - Frenchie B. is user Judy B. now.  

Updated 3/16/12:

First I was glad to see the owner private message regarding our experience there, that was nice.  But then I noticed the same user end ""Frenchie B."" wrote a review for Au Petit Four too.  

Private Message:  ""May be you were shocked by the price you paid, let me tell you we did not rise our price from the esplanade.  You 2 cakes and 2 creme brulee and they are the most expensive of the 10 items ingredients we use are very expensive and high quality.  You should ask the detail bill to Pierre there is no reason you did not have it.  Do not feel ripped off, I feel sorry, because you came over to Scottsdale, but I also Hope to see you again soon.  Thank you and have a nice week end.""

Part of their review on 3/9/12 states: ""Also,  if 50 dollars is to expensive for you after having 2 sodas especially the delicious lemonades who are from france so they are more expensive then a can of coke, 2 meals and 2 desserts then mcdonalds is better for you..price wise of course."" 

After review their review, I was shock to see how they think about their customers.  How 2 faced can you get.  Nice in the private message and then blast a customer on a public review.  If I would have had 2 drinks, 2 meals, and 2 desserts for $50, that is a great deal.  We had 5 non-alcoholic drinks, 4 desserts, and a cookie for $48.50.  You know, we should have taken the kids to McDonalds for dessert.

5,"Toby's is wonderful.  Family run and super friendly.  Sit at the bar, have a cocktail and get your dinner order in.  When things are ready to roll, the staff will seat you and most often your soup/salad is waiting at the table when you arrive.  The lake perch and the fried chicken are excellent.  Don't miss this place!"
5,"This is an excellent HAND car wash. They have an excellent staff with superb customer service. Their staff always gives you prompt and courteous attention, and their prices are very reasonable. They pay excellent attention to detail, vacuuming under mats and cleaning the insides of cup holders and a/c vent slats. I absolutely love this car wash!"
1,"This location does not have good service. Went through drive-through and they forgot our drinks and our sides. While they were preparing what they forgot, we could see another girl who had her back to us and it was obvious that she was on her phone. Any other KFC would be better."
1,"You literally couldn't pay me to go here ever again. Which is sad because when I was young my Dad and I loved to go here. However, things have changed and standards seem to be much lower. 
In short, the service was slow and the food was disgusting. The chicken was rubbery and the mashed potatoes were freezer burned...it was like eating cafeteria food only more expensive lol! 
0/10 would never ever recommend."
5,"Amazing!  I can't believe all these types of plants shrubs and herbs grow in Wisconsin soil!  Such a beautifully kept grounds. They have a tram going around the 16-acres, but that's really for the elderly so we didn't take it.  Then when it rolled by us we saw no elderly people on it at all.  It was a nice day out so we enjoyed walking the grounds.  Best was the Thai garden as it felt so calm and relaxing, not to mention the beautiful pavilion.  Just a note to people, you really shouldn't be touching things in a botanical garden.  My partner didn't know that was implied, so just for future visitors to be aware and please inform your party."
1,"Last night we planned a special Valentine's dinner! We made reservations 2 weeks in advance so we would definitely have a table! It was a very important night for us and we went looking forward to a lasagne dinner!  Unfortunately at 8:15 pm they were out! We were stunned, disappointed, and decided to settle for spaghetti! We did ask for the manager and he explained that they did not plan on so many wanting lasagne!  Well the bread was very good!  We had to ask for more and had to go find someone to get us some more butter!  We mentioned this to the hostess who proceeded to tell us our waiter was new!  After dinner when the manager wanted to know if we enjoyed. We told him.... not really... It was not what we wanted and $55 was pretty expensive for spaghetti!  He asked so we told him what we thought! Oh my!  He was rude, talking to us in a loud voice!!! Now we are getting mad but pay the bill and get up to leave at this point we just want to be gone! The manager is following us out and now he is yelling!  We were very much shocked he starting yelling the F word.  The doors are wide open and he does not seem to care that the entire place can easily hear him! He sees we are parked in handicapped right out front! Now he is yelling even louder about us illegally parking! Oh by the way the parking pass is extremely valid! This is a very unpleasant scene by the MANAGER!  The spaghetti was definitely not worth it!  Unfortunately I will never get to try the lasagne!  Do not recommend at all!"
1,"NASTY! 

I have lived in Phoenix now for 7 years and have been searching and searching for an up to standard Chinese food restaurant (specifically Sesame Chicken)... and thought I would give this place a try after reading the reviews. 

Another disappointment. The lunch menu is tiny, they didn't even know what Sesame chicken was and my food came out in literally 1 minute which makes me think they have a vat of it sitting in the kitchen pre-made. My  mom ordered the sweet & sour prawns and we were both surprised she could even take a bite to try it... just looked plain nasty. 

The soup was disgusting and offered no choice besides the ""soup of the day"" nasty vegetable eggdrop and I have never before see some of the things that were cooked inside the eggroll. Scary. 

Guessing I will just give up on my search and have to fly into NYC or California for a plate, thank god I am a flight attendant and can do so! 

Such a disappointment Phoenix Chinese food restaurants are, how is there not ONE good go-to? You Phoenicians have no standards when writing these reviews, I will never yelp another Chinese place and take the locals words for it's rating. 

Pei-Wei it is, unforunately :-("
1,"The food was decent.  But yet again, the staff managed to screw my order up and ended up charging me more then what I should of payed for."
5,Great Sauce.  Great baked beans.  Great pork sandwich.
5,Such great restaurants and parks...
1,"The last time I went there, when I got back in my car it REEKED of body odor from whoever had been working on the interior.  It was so bad I had to roll my windows down while driving, and when I picked up my kids about an hour later, they even noticed the smell.  Also, I had an MP3 player in my middle console, a compartment they had absolutely no reason to open or go into, and it disappeared that day.  I will NEVER go to this place again."
1,"This company has sketchy business practices. It took them over 7 weeks to do our small job and then DOUBLED their price once the job was done. They never called to let us know the price increased prior to doing the work. Will never use them again. Consumer beware! Their explanation? ""The initial quote was just an estimate"""
5,"Well, I have a little 2001 Ford Taurus.  My lovely silver grandma car is fantastic for the 100-200 miles I drive per month.  And now, my little car has a great shop looking after her.

I took my car in as it was time for an oil change and I was convinced my serpentine belt was about to go.  It had that tell-tale burning smell which was making me nervous.  Turns out I had a loose oil-filter from my last oil change and dripping oil + catalytic converter = my car is about to die smell.

Virginia Auto Service changed my oil and cleaned up my engine.  It was so nice to receive a call from them saying my belt was fine and an oil change was all I needed.  It was refreshing to be given an honest assessment vs being told some great story about some random repair that was needed...I am a female after all and have received some rather odd diagnoses in the past (your rotors fell off, so you'll need to have them replaced for example).

It is very reassuring to know I now have an honest, kind and reliable repair shop for my car.  Did my oil change run a bit more than some $19.99 special?  Yes, but it was so worth it!  Now my little one won't be getting an oil change for another year most likely, but my service advisor, Robert, asked me to please stop by every three months so they could check out my belts, tire pressure, etc just to be safe.  Now THAT is service!"
1,Just watched a guy in a SF Giants cap flip burgers with his glove. Gross.
5,"Great morning breakfast spot. Take the kids, they love watching the planes."
5,"I have to give this place 5 stars. Yes, 5 stars! I am not a big fan of watching sports on TV since I love the joy of being at the game, however the energy at this location is better than attending a sporting event. The food is great. I mean ""GREAT"". I have enjoyed everything on the menu I have tasted so far. There is something on the menu for everyone and any type of dietary need. My favorites are the Boneless Wings, Chicken Strips (real white meat), and the Taco Salad. I am surprised the French Fries have not put McDonalds out of business. They are addicting. To top it off the they have top notch service. I have never had a problem, compliant or been disappointed. You can tell the employees love the place that they work out and enjoy to serve the patrons.

My office has had several private parties at this location. They have two areas where you can throw parties. My favorite is the Cotton Room. It is a private room that is very hip, urban, all white with glass mirrors surrounding the room. Kinda like a mini retro dance space. It has plush leather white seating, big screen tv's and a private bar. The resturant does catering and take-out."
1,"In my constant search for newer, faster, and more interesting routes on my commute to work from CenPho to Tempe, I've been passing by Rosita's a lot recently, and coerced my husband, who came home the other night and said, ""Carolina's?"" to try Rosita's instead. Boy, was I sorry. 

Let's start with the mariachi musicians who stood so closely behind me that they completely invaded my ""stranger bubble"" and I was forced to move my seat at the table. Next, there were the chips which were just ok to begin with, and ended with gobs of congealed grease after they had cooled a tad. Then, hubby's machaca chimi was fine, with decent flavor, but my pork carnitas was so dry it was literally inedible. You could look at it and see that the sliced pork was so dry it was like the dessicated flesh at the Body Worlds exhibit. Gross, I know, but so was this meat. It simply should not have been served by a conscientious restaurant. 

Next time, I won't contest it when Hubby suggests Carolina's (who serves the best chimis and by far the best tortillas in town)."
1,"One of the most disgusting restaurants I've ever eaten at. I was on a business trip in Phoenix on decided to stop in for some Mexican food. The place was bad news from the very beginning.

The hostess was super unfriendly and looked as if she couldn't wait to get home. When I sat down at the table, a couple of bugs fell onto the table from the lamp shade overhead-- I should have gotten up then.

The chips were greasy, margaritas straight sugar w/ very little liquor and the enchiladas bland as can be. In addition to this, I got food poisoning and was up all night running to the bathroom.

You couldn't pay me to go back to this restaurant. It should be closed down immediately for its lack of cleanliness and poorly prepared food."
1,"Hubby insisted we had eaten here before. I thought not. I was partly right, as we have eaten at the Good Egg before, and not been very pleased. Hubby had hated their crepe-eggs. We didn't know the connection between the two restaurants before we sat down.

Starving, I order their farmhouse eggs benedict and Hubby orders their breakfast quesadilla and an Oreo pancake (he just HAD to try it). We both get iced tea and it tastes funny, like it was made with bad tap water. When the food arrives, Hubby inhales his quesadilla, but says nothing about its quality. The Oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table. I gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny, nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy. The only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs. The turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right- it's not crispy and the taste is off. The biscuits taste like they are from a mix. To top it off, the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table. Nice. Can you at least pretend you didn't just give me the leftover water from someone else's table? Our server never returns to fill our tea (except when dropping off the check), or even to see how things are. Maybe he knows better than to ask."
1,"An anti-hybrid of fogies stuck in their ways of business and young kids that don't give a shit. 

As soon as you walk in to the store, you are bombarded with stink. That stench comes from the overbearing sprayers that take guerrilla tactics and stink bomb you from counter angles. You have no clue what wretched stank is coming from where. After you run (jog, hell no), from Smell Factor, you are greeted with overpriced products. 

Everywhere you turn, there have brands that have not been promoted since the 80's at like $70+ for a shirt. Insane. I wonder why they have had financial issues for decades.

The service is so annoying. You can tell they are told to rush customers. Those that are older take it to heart and do so with parody-worthy vigor. The younger clerks are indifferent; you could read the ""don't bother me and let me text my bff because they pay me minimum wage anyway"" expression. 

The potpourri of intolerables beckons a new chapter in the Fear and Loathing series ..."
1,Went there with a couple female friends late night for reverse happy hour and the male bartender was rude and made derogatory remark towards my female friends. When I called the manager over she was sympathetic but I will never go there again
1,"The wait was pretty long. But I'm not a very patient person, I'll admit. 
I went during lunch with my family, so I was able to taste a bit of a few dishes. 

First of all, their lunch menu is really small. When I sat down and realized that my favorite dishes weren't even on their menu, I was immediately disappointed. I had their papaya salad and honestly, it wasn't that great. It was actually one of the worst ones I've ever had. The flavoring was really off. How do I know? I am Thai and grew up there, so I know what som tum is supposed to taste like. And it really does not taste like that. I had some of their pad thai also and was really really disappointed. I mean, for the prices they charge and for the wait time and horrible service, I was really expecting something really good. 

The mood was actually really nice. Their decorations and open kitchen were a really nice touch, which is what they're getting the star for. However, it did become very loud very fast when the room filled up. It was difficult to keep a conversation going. 

For all the hype that people have made about this place, I honestly expected a lot better. But even if I walked in without any expectations, I would have still be disappointed."
5,"I love you, That's A Wrap!

Not only is the food great tasting, the names of the food are great sounding!  I prefer the Greek Gatsby and Cypress salad, but love to say:

Foo Man Chew
Tipper and Alba-Gore Tuna
Gringo Star
The Veggie Jackson

and the list goes on.... go see for yourself and walk away feeling full and like you got your money's worth."
5,"How have I driven by this place so many times? I never knew such good food awaited me inside this little shop as I drove by.
Wow, when my girlfriend was really sick a few weeks ago her close friend took us Rositas for some spicey healing food.
Chips and salsa were really good. Fresh hot chips,that they make right there in store.
Along with 2 delish salsas.
We got the best Chicken soup I have ever had in my life. Yes, better than my Mothers. But, do not tell her. I don't want to hurt her feelings.

Each of our soups had a full chicken breast inside. The broth was amazing.
Our meal was amazing and more than I could eat. 
By that night my girlfriend felt like a new person, it really was the healing food.
Recently I stopped in a little short of time and got an order to go.
Again fantastic ,hot ,delish food.
The ladies that work there are so sweet as well!
This is so good and so inexspensive as well. I sort of hate to share my new find,because, it will get really busy and I won't find a seat. 
But you will love this place."
5,"The first thing about Fraboni's is what everyone else has said: that second you open the door and breathe in the various food smells. Hey, it's the little things in life! If I want to cook Italian, I HAVE to go to Fraboni's to pick up the ingredients. I usually drop in for their deli and ready-made sandwiches. I think they wave a wand over the sandwiches before setting them out because anywhere else it would be just a sandwich. Theirs are the most fantastic deli sandwiches I've had in Madison.

Anyway, if you haven't gone, go."
5,"We have been coming here for a Couple of years and love this place! Rose, Trina and Lyna are the best! The boys are fun and great too."
5,"I knew I was in the right place when...
I spied a quote taped to the wall about the invaluable price of honesty and quality.

I knew I was in the right place when...
at least eight certificates of completion by their employees and owners lined the top of the office walls.

I knew I was in the right place when...
I saw their love of BMW's evident in the racing team they sponsor.

I knew I was in the right place when...
I explained my psychotic attachment to the car and Ken was kind enough to talk me through their repair procedure. 

I knew I was in the right place when...
I was given a ride back to my house by the OWNER (30+ years) who flies around the country to learn new things about the cars he services. LOVE the flag detailing on the company (aka HIS) car!

Look I'll be honest, the shop isn't sleek like a dealer's and I find that comforting.*  It means they put their efforts under the hoods of the cars they service rather than in upscale sofas, noshes and newspapers. 

These guys take pride in what they do. One trip and I'm in love.

I will never go back to Chapman BMW on Camelback when I can have excellence, pride, quality and affordability from Ken and the team at Bavarian Motors.

*For the record it's not a pig stye. it's homey and comfortable... Like a family's refrigerator with the kids' drawings and good grades on it."
1,"Went in and was promptly seated.  Someone came over and dumped water in our cups (with attitude) and walked away.  15 minutes later no one had come to get our order, others who sat down after us had ordered already.  Felt like maybe we were not served because we were not asian, as almost everyone else in the restaurant was.  Cant say for sure,.  The only time anyone talked to us was to ask if there were two for dinner before we sat down.  Disappointed because we were really looking forward to trying something different and authentic (menu looked good) - ended up walking out and going to tempe marketplace for dinner instead.  Apparently they didn't want to serve us."
5,"I've had BBQ in the Carolinas, St. Louis, and San Diego (Phil's), and I can honestly say that Smoky Jon's is the best I've ever had!!  It is a must have anytime you are near Madison."
1,"Best Buy,you really suck.
Tried to buy a camera the other day.
Mid day,mid week,store pretty empty.
3 employees hanging around the camera department as I started to look at options.
No one asked if they could help,in fact they first stopped their conversation in an attempt to become invisible.
No problem,I'll poke around till I either find what I want ,or until I have comparison questions to narrow down choices.
I think I have it,I'm ready to select.
Where'd everyone go?
I'm so lonely.
I start to wander a bit and see if they're doing laundry in the appliance section.
nope.
Maybe around by the video cameras.
Nope nope.
Under a display cabinet?
Nah,that would be silly...
They were just gone.
Poofed.
Vanished.
Vaporized.
I decided it had to be the nefarious work of aliens.
Yes,I said ""nefarious"".
I became frightened in my alone-ness Fearing next would be an invasion of the Apple People of the Crack Basha's.
Who would protect me?
The aliens abducted all the staff of Best Buy,so it would just be me.
I couldn't possibly stop them all.
They would come,snarling their toofless grimaces at me.
I would be defenseless.
Fearing my life and existance as I know it,I saw only 3 choices.
1)Face them all.Aliens and Apple People of the Crack Basha's.Fight till the end or vaporization.
2)Take what I wanted as there was no one left to stop me.
3)Make a hasty retreat and go elsewhere to purchase a camera.
Gentle readers,as you read this harrowing tale,you can safely assume I chose plan #3.
New camera in my possession,safe at home taking pictures of the pets grateful to have gotten out alive.
Since all the help at Best Buy has been vaporized,you may want to go elsewhere if you'd like to purchase anything that isn't self serve.
Remember to get a subscription to some crap magazine on your way out.
Thank you,come again."
5,Funky 50's vibe... Staff was excellent and educated on ingredients and choices. Really the some of the best food I've had in Madison at a veryy reasonable price.
1,"I totally 100% agree w Serianna T.

I have felt the same way about the seating, and parking and mediocre foods... Postino and LGO are complete cluster F***s for anyone who plans on driving there. I also feel like the general atmosphere is trying so hard to be relaxed and casual that it is stressful for the guests."
5,"Any place that serves both caffeine and alcohol, then gives you access to reliable wifi and leaves you alone for five hours is good in my book."
1,"One of my worst experience ever my eating pupusas. 
With that said the owner took our order and she was rude not friendly at all.....
1. She get the order wrong
2. She food was kind of cold
3. Seen like she didn't want to be there (she is the owner) found out she was the when I was paying the bill
4. She was trying to over charge the bill postings images of bill.  
5. She never told us about the drinks weren't free refills 
6. Got mad when I pointed out that the bill was added wrong 
7. Slam the bill on the table when she corrected it. Even my girlfriend who is calm was shocked
8. When the bill the guy owner said sorry for the bad service
When noticed I not happy"
5,"When I was younger, my aunt who lived in Arizona at the time would take me here. I love going to this wonderful museum, mostly of Southwestern groups but of course that makes sense since that's the region. It was one of my favorite things to do when visiting Arizona. My Arizona trip would just not be complete without visiting the Heard Museum.

There is so much beautiful and famous artwork. Such a beautiful collection of Katsina/Kachina dolls. I loved making cornhusk dolls as a girl. I still have them to this day. It's a great place for kids and adults. I have such great childhood memories here. I haven't gone in years but checking out the website, it still looks great and I will always think of my aunt.  8.) I do plan to go back one day."
1,"I used to like their food
Honestly.

It was my one year anniversary.
Me and me man went here to celebrate

I had a lobster tail
And a filet

On the way home, I got violently ill
Like, within ten minutes of leaving this place.
And no, I only had a few glasses of champagne :)

I ended up going home, and laying on the floor for awhile crying, moaning, vomiting, etc

After about an hour, I couldn't take it anymore
I called 911

The paramedics showed up, I was naked and crying on the floor.

It was a VERY romantic anniversary, let me tell you.

After a long night at Scottsdale Osborn hospital, it was determined that the lobster tail was undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill.

I'll never eat here again.
Simply because I've never been so sick.

It's a shame though, because on the way down, the lobster tail had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally delicious.

HOWEVER
I contacted Ruths Chris and they refunded my dinner amount, paid my hospital copay, and were SOOO nice and accomodating to my every demand.  Bravo.

Although, Boo for almost killing me.

Eh, I'm torn."
5,"I moved back to the Madison area after being away for seven years, and I desperately needed someone to cut my hair.  After trying a few places, I finally decided to give Ultimate Salon a try and I am glad I did!  Upon my arrival at the salon, I was quickly checked in for my appointment, and was offered coffee, water, or soda.  I relaxed in the waiting area and was pleasantly surprised to have my stylist, Pada, come and get me just a few minutes later, since I was ten minutes early.

Pada asked me some questions about my hair and what I wanted done with it.  I knew I wanted a different cut than I currently had but I wasn't sure what I wanted, so she recommended a few styles.  I picked one and she got to work.  

I love the new haircut!  Pada gave me exactly what I wanted and she gave me a lot of useful tips on styling it.  She was very friendly and the complimentary neck/shoulder massage she gave me after washing my hair was divine.  I will definitely return to Ultimate Salon and Pada."
5,"I know a lot of people have complaints, but I was here for a convention in January and it was a perfect place to stay.  I had a small room with an adorable bathroom, all of which had character.  The bar had great beer, the staff was friendly and my hot water was just fine, unless the room next door flushed.  :)
It's an old hotel, with character, so if you want sterility book somewhere else.  I loved it.  It was the only good thing about downtown Phoenix as far as I could tell."
5,Great food. great view of the ball park. cant wait to go back there
5,"Finally went to Deli Roma yesterday and so glad i did. I've been meaning to go for a while but, always forget about it because of it's location. It's small but cool at the same time. All the Italian nostalgia in there is fun to look at while you wait.

We got a veggie muffaletta, grilled panini, and a Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog.

Veggie Muffaletta ($5.25)~ Wow! So much flavor with the olives, 2 kinds of cheese, and the in house olive dressing. Served on a 5"" round Pane Mariano bread (my new favorite bread). Great price for a huge sandwich.

Grilled Panini ($6.49)~ It was the panini of the week, not sure what it was. It had 2 kinds of meat( ham and salami i believe) and cheese. The focaccia bread was grilled to perfection. We got the order to go and it was still super hot when we got home! Tasty sandwich with a TON of meat in there!

Chicago style Vienna all beef hot dog ($2.75)~ Very good dog with all the fixings. Only complaint was that it was not very warm but that's OK with a hot dog i guess.

If you can find this place you need to go! The mailman was eating lunch when we were there. I always think if the mailman eats there, you know it's good!"
5,"I love this friendly, neighborhood gym. It has everything you could want - cardio, weights, machines, trainers, power-lifting/strong man equipment, boxing, plus yoga and martial arts classes upstairs. This old-school gym is all about working out!  :-)"
5,"The best Italian food in town, hands down.  They've got homemade sausage that's the best I've ever had, and they use fresh basil like there's no tomorrow.  My girlfriend's favorite is the pasta with giant prawns and pancetta.   This place is too good for Madison."
5,Only place around that I can get no ethanol gasoline.
5,"We went here for a family Christmas brunch last month. Having lived in town for nearly 20 years, we had always seen but never actually been to SIR Hobo's. We had no idea what we were missing. When we first sat down, we were greated by a jolly waitress with a thick, possibly Greek accent. Her nametag said her name was Gerestina, but her attitude said she loved her job. The complimentary water was, in a word, exquisite. And the meal only got better. But the biggest surprise was when, about 20 minutes into our meal, a homeless man with a whooping cough and a peg leg stumbled through the door and colapsed. The cook came crashing out of the kitchen, carrying a CPR mask in one hand and a bloody meat cleaver in the other. Through his quick action, the cook was able to resucitate the homeless man. As we all applauded, the homeless man stood up to shake the cook's hand. The homeless man was crying and gave every single person in the restaurant a great big bear hug. It seems that SIR hobos still certainly cares for our fine city's hobo community."
5,"I love Dexter's. It's a short walk away, so I go there a lot. I've been there dozens of times.

Their daily specials are usually what I check out, and they come with a cup of soup. And that soup is usually amazing. Their chili is always fantastic. Their fish fry is also very good. They have a beef brisket sandwich called the BBLT that is always really good.

They have plenty of beer on tap, and plenty of televisions for your viewing pleasure. The staff is always friendly and willing to recommend something."
5,Absolutely the best place to get a delicious Reuben and brew fries in town! My favorite dive on the Eastside of Madison.
5,Excellent food and excellent service!
1,"Oh, how I dislike this store.  What does a girl have to do to get someone to find her a macbook battery?  Seriously.  How many people do I have to ask.  And, then, finally someone goes to look, only to come back saying that they don't have any.  The mac store has no macbook batteries?"
1,"I normally don't have a problem with Dominos--you pretty much know what you're getting for your money.

Unfortunately, this Dominos, even though it is less than 3 miles away, won't deliver to my address. Not only will they not deliver, but they will take my order, ask me what the cross-streets are (so they KNOW how far I am), and wait 30 minutes before calling to tell me that they cancelled my order.

They could have checked my address when I gave it to them, or they could have called and asked if I wanted to pick it up instead, but instead they simly cancelled my order--and didn't let me know until it was supposed to be at my door,"
5,"Long time user of Yelp...first time reviewer and Sam's is the reason!

WOW...what a great restaurant and an even better experience.

First, the chips & salsa that showed up as we sat down - Almost impossible to describe how good this combination of sweet, spicy, flavorful and tangy this kickoff to dinner was.  You must go and you MUST have the chips and salsa...YUM!

Then, dinner.  And it was fast and delicioso!  I had the Black and Blue quesidilla and my partner had a pork dish and holy cramoly...amazing.  Not only was the service fabulous and fast, but the attention to detail was truly surprising AND, did I mention the food was fantastic!

Then we met up with Nicole - manager extraordinaire and a really nice person to socialize with during dinner.  She came over and asked how our dinner was going and then shared stories of her experiences with us and what's cool (and not so cool) about Phoenix.  Always great to hear it direct from a local . . . thanks Nicole, you made our evening really special.

And then finally, after all was said and done, our waitress Sally brought these little corn-husk wrapped fingerlings of vanilla infused white-chocolate with pecans encrusted throughout.  Seriously...just shoot me!

I'd give Sam's a 10 star rating, but then again, this is my first time reviewing a restaurant so, it's a pleasure to start off my Yelp career with such a great and wonderful place.  PLUS, there's a Canyon Cafe' restaurant (parent company of Sam's) about 10 minutes from my house in St. Louis so as soon as I get back home, I'd headed there for more fun and food.

Thanks Sam's...WOW!"
1,"I Hesitated to write this review on the Phoenix VA Hospital, but it should be said.  Last year I lived across the street from the NW Phoenix VA clinic.  I applied for care there, and was told I could not be seen there.  They were not taking new patients, as they had lost the services of several doctors.  I was told I might try the Phoenix VA Hospital.  I did and was given an appt almost 1 year from my call date.  My needs were not for a cold or a cut finger.  It was for Diabetes and I was told they could not see me sooner and that is how it was.  I felt something was strange with the entire experience.  I had to find private care, and even that was difficult in the area.  I could not retire in Arizona and the lack of health care was a big part of the reason, as I was going to need VA health care as I got older. Diabetes was not magically going away, it needed treatment.    They seemed to have no interest in seeing me.  I could not depend on that, so I have had to make other plans in life. I would not be able to retire in Arizona.    I think that is a shame in itself.  I realize everyone has a different experience, but I gave mine and it is a honest review of what happened to me in 2013.   I was so sorry to hear of the veterans that had died over these delays in care.  It is a disgrace but I am not surprised at all by this behavior in Phoenix.  They obviously are overwhelmed.  They need a 2nd hospital for one thing and a lot more staff."
1,Horrible. Been in the emergency waiting room for over 6 hours to be seen for difficulty breathing and chest pains. It's so frustrating.
5,"I would like to make my rating based on three things: Food quality, customer service and consistency. I've tried MANY asian food establishments here in the valley since moving here three years ago and this is by far the best I've had! I usually order To Go and my food is always ready before I get there and am greeted with a kind hello and an appreciative smile (how nice!). I've ordered from them many times and have been impressed everytime. Thank you for the great food!!"
1,"I have been an infrequent but long-term customer of Cactus Flower since the early 1990's. Last year I had unsatisfactory experiences with one of the shops, but decided to give the Phoenix shop a try. Good decision, for the one order they delivered.  

 I stopped in yesterday to order for V Day. A somewhat distracted employee tossed a couple tattered catalog pages on the table for me to choose from, and described a few. When I asked that it be delivered by the time the recipient leaves work, she said school delivery was before 2, and businesses by 5 PM. Since the recipient leaves work by 3, I asked that she be included in the ""school"" delivery. No can do, policy is policy! It came down to a quick but clearly evident battle of wills between the young employee and me, she wasn't going to budge, and I wasn't going to risk the order being late.  

So I voted with my dollars, 150 of them, and took my business elsewhere."
5,"Great shop. People are really nice, and they don't treat like a loser because you don't have a $1000 bike. We've bought three bikes from them and traded in two old ones - getting a good price for each. Awesome small shop - really recommend it."
5,"I seem to be going to Tom's Restaurant & Tavern about every two weeks. where  I meet my friend for lunch.  I love this place and our main waiter, Frank, Jr.  not only is he so professional, courteous and funny, but  becomes your friend right away.  You would think you have known him forever.  Their food is delicious and they have a huge menu.  It's very nice because you can either choose to sit outside on the patio like a cafe' setting, or sit inside the restaurant.  They are reasonably priced and most of the people that eat there are on their lunch hour, so they do hurry to get your food out.  I highly suggest you try Tom's Restaurant and Tavern the next time you are down on Central Ave."
1,"I went here and I told the guy this is my first time I ever been in a cigar shop and I asked whats the difference between these two cigars? He responded with ""if you need to ask you dont need to be here""  then it was just silent and I walked out and now I just go right down the street to cigar ware house on 10thst and camelback."
5,"...NOW WE'RE TALKIN'! Killer Mexican Food! The chips 'n salsa kicks ass! You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip! Hellava start! A kick-butt margarita! Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST! Cannot wait to return! Great ambiance."
1,"The last time I went in there I observed: cross contamination, unfriendly service(no two part greeting), dirty rag BUCKETS left ON THE COUNTER where they set the tongs for serving food, no hand washing by employees, and confusion with my order although it was a simple one consisting of 12 strips.
Also, another customer came in while I was waiting and asked if they could prioritize her order because she was in a hurry. They said yes, but it resulted in a lot of confusion between employees which drastically slowed service time. The customer complained about the wait, which resulted in an indifferent response from a employee. He said ""if you wanted your order faster you should have called it in"". He said this with an attitude. Then he turned to me and asked if I thought he handled that correctly, and I said no. 
In the end, being a former employee of this establishment, I was very disappointed with the cleanliness and customer service."
5,"After hearing great reviews of Louisianne's, my husband and I decided to give it a try.  We went for appetizers and drinks rather than a full meal.  We sat at the bar and had excellent service by the bartender.  When we first arrived it wasn't very crowded, but after 10 minutes the bar was packed with people. The atmosphere was cozy and very welcoming with the live piano music.

We had the ""combination for 2"" (crab puffs, barbecue shrimp, and stuffed mushrooms) and an order of the mussels for a total of $20.  The mussels were filling since they are in a cream sauce and served with yummy bread.  The combination plate was also excellent.  We were pleasantly full and enjoyed a nice bottle of wine for around $55.  

It is nice to see a high quality restaurant in Middleton!  We will definitely be back again!"
1,This place SUCKS!  Every time I go in here it depresses the shit out of me.  People say it's haunted and I would agree - haunted by degenerates and meth heads.  I always say I'll never go back but that never happens...
5,"Ryan's Pet Supplies is definitely the place to be! There is not a single place besides Ryan's where I can buy tons of treats and other goodies for my dogs and actually save money! I now cringe at prices at other pet stores because I know that Ryan's has the same exact item, but significantly cheaper. 
The drive is definitely worth it, and what's best is that you can place pick up orders (which will be ready within 3 hours of you placing the order) and there is no additional cost for that, which is great if you are short on time or can only make it in before they close but don't have enough time to walk through the warehouse. You can call in orders and place them online as well. Definitely a great place to be, and if you ask for help, the workers will definitely help you out!!"
5,"You can find me here every Tuesday night. You see they have a daily rotating specials menu and it so happens to feature the best veggie burrito (this is saying a lot coming from me, since I am obsessed with burritos and have lived in Phoenix for most of my life) for a little over $5 on Tuesdays! It is so massive.. if you know the size of a Chipotle burrito, imagine that, but doubled! Seriously, it consists of two very large tortillas, which are needed to whole the damn monster of a burrito together. This happens to insure that the contents don't spill out of the tortilla! Genius. I am fairly sure this burrito weighs more than most new born babies.. yes, that's even considering how all the hormones people consume today are making babies larger each year - this burrito would still out weight them my friends!

Anyhow, the burrito is large enough to satisfy me for three complete meals. Awesome for $5. The guac that they make is top notch, and their rice is truly amazing. It all tastes very authentic, and I love that I can easily make it vegan since they don't add any secrets into their food. I just have to ask them to hold the cheese and sour cream, and they have never once slipped up on this! Which also keeps me coming back.

Oh, and the salsa bar is to die for! I am usually creeped out by salsa bars (think Baja Fresh - yuck) but they actually make some damn good salsas and usually have a bowl of chopped onions... I can never get enough. I think my personal favorite salsa is called something like Salsa Fresca - it's usually all the way to the right. Be sure to try it with your free chips.

On top of everything I love about this place is the fact that it is so close that I can walk there in a few minutes. Although I hate strip malls, I am glad that this little joint is downtown and not somewhere completely stupid.

Stop by and check it out when you want some affordable, authentic tasting AND high quality Mexican food."
1,"This place is aweful! I got my brakes done and just 4 months later they were toast. Called to have them fix and they refuse. They took my 400 and now won't honor fixing their crappy job.
My advice- avoid this place at all costs."
5,"The manager and mechanics are kind, honest people who provide phenomenal service. I went in to have my muffler and center pipe replaced due to rusting issues. 

They saved me $600 over the dealership service quote, had the required parts delivered within the hour, and finished the maintenance itself in about an hour.  

I felt entirely comfortable trusting my car to them, and plan to have all of my future servicing done here."
1,"I'm with the reviewer from 1-4.  I've been shopping at BE since i was a kid in the 70's and after yesterday, I'm done.  I went in on Saturday and spent a couple hours, purchasing over $200 of clothes. Turns out one of the shirts I bought had 2 huge holes down the middle of the back, unsewable and totally unwearable.  I went back Sunday to see if I could return it for store credit and to trade in several bags of my old clothing.  Long story short; one of the managers gave me a really hard time about returning the shirt, as it had been half off, and she treated me like a total jerk for asking her to work with me, and acted like she was doing me the biggest favor in the world by accepting the return.  She was pretty snotty and rude.  THEN, when it was my turn to trade, a nice guy began helping me, and had accepted a couple of my things, and things seemed fine.  Said manager showed up, elbowed the guy out of the way, and began going through my items herself.  She purchased ONE item out of several large bags and sent me on my way.  It was an incredible blatant FU to me for ""forcing her hand"" when it came to my return.  What grade are we in again?  I am still amazed that this even happened.  What a great manager!  I bet her employees really enjoy working for her.  It's too bad, I found lots of clothes I loved, but I'll stick to other businesses, like My Sister's Closet and whatnot, where the employees are nice and don't sell clothes that can't be worn."
5,"I've noticed some of the reviews say best for older children but i've been taking my son since before he could walk and absolutely love it! He has the greatest time. Even though he doesn't quite understand the science behind everything, he loves running around and pressing all the buttons. The weather machine is his favorite. During the warmer months he loves playing in the ball fountain. We started going here after getting a free cultural pass at the library and loved it so much we ended up getting a membership. It is definitely worth it to get a membership. We go a few times a month and it never gets old. You can find discounts on memberships on living social before the holidays. We've gotten our memberships for 50-30% off over the past two years. 

If you have a toddler best time to come is when school is in session and after 1pm. This place gets packed with school groups in the mornings."
5,"I followed the trail left by fellow Yelpers and this was as accurate it goes. 

Ambience: There is not much to it. Even the owner admits that much. However, it is bright and open. Most of all, it looks welcoming.  

Food: It's very good, but most of all, it's excellent bang for the buck! The teriyaki is not too sweet and it is well seasoned. I ordered the chicken fried rice with Iced tea. It was great. The iced tea comes with unlimited refills which the owner often reminds the customers while I was there.

Service: Although it is a ""self-service"" restaurant, the owner and staff was extremely helpful to a fault. She refilled my iced tea a couple of times.

I will return for sure. The owner did take her time to talk to most if not all her customers. If you are looking for a friendly place with good food, this would be it! It definitely does not hurt that the food is very affordable."
1,"Awful experience this week.  Ordered the Oregano's Favorite salad.  A quarter of the salad was not edible.  Disgusting, rancid lettuce.  After calling over the manager, his response was to say he would check the lettuce supply to make sure no one else would have to endure what I did.
HOW ABOUT WHAT I HAD TO ENDURE?  Not even an offer to remake the salad.  Those people just don't care.  Management needs a lesson in customer service.
Will never return."
5,"We have been here several times, and it has been fantastic every time.

The wait staff always remembers us, and is very friendly. The service is always great.

They keep the place clean as well, and that is a major plus.

The food has always been very, very good. Flavorful, and well priced.

I always order the Merry-Mu, which is a very good pork dish. I have also recently become a fan of the Fillet, as it is better than most steaks I have eaten that were three times the price at other places.

The Coconut sticky rice could be a meal all by itself, it is that good - and I am not a rice fan. Even the garnish/filler food is loaded with flavor.

The Mango Cheesecake is my favorite cheesecake desert of any place I have eaten, it is amazing.

I think this is one of the best places to eat in Phoenix, and it is worth the wait, the drive, and the money."
1,"This place would be out of business if it were not located next to 3 hotels and the convention center. It is not completely horrible, but I would recommend walking a few blocks up to Arizona Center complex where they have 3 or 4 different choices. If you are staying at the hotels and need some quick take out, sure this place will work (across the street). But if you are on vacation and planning a sit down dinner, don't waste one of your few vaca nights here."
1,"DO NOT GET KEYS MADE HERE!

I am so annoyed with this Ace. I moved into a new place and needed to get keys made. The cashier paged someone and after waiting about 15 minutes I headed toward the exit, then he finally arrived. I had 5 keys made, 2 didn't fit.  Went back to have the 2 fixed, 1 still didn't work. Ugh!

Fast forward a year later and keep in mind my deteriorating memory, I once again had to get keys made and returned to this location. I got 5 made, 2 didn't work (sound familiar). When I went  back to get the keys fixed the woman who helped me told me it is not usually the fault of the people cutting the keys, but the calibration of the machine. She assured me the machine was just calibrated so we should have no issues. 

And guess what? One of the keys STILL doesn't fit."
1,"Horrible. Sad, tired, low-end joint with food that is just not good. No redeeming characteristics. I'll never go back."
5,"When I was in Madison as a student I loved to go to the Blue Plate with friends because they always had options for the meat eaters and the vegetarians. As a former vegetarian, I think I first came here when I was a vegetarian. It was a long time ago. The diner theme is part of the aesthetic here, and my favorite dishes are the meat loaf, and the breakfast scrambles. My friend and I got two big breakfasts and the service was good on what looked like a crazy-busy Sunday brunch-rush. The coffee dude was keeping our cups full and warm as our server was moving past us bringing out amazing plates of super fresh food, yet always checking with us to see how we were doing. Busy, high quality standards, and lots of great cakes and pies if you have any room. I used to get the pie/cake to go, but not this time. 

It is just wonderful to see a place that was good over 10 years ago, still keeping its standards high and keeping people like me wishing they still lived in Madison! Great place. Great food. Great people."
5,"My husband and I returned to Imperial Garden for dinner with our children. We were there on a Friday night. There was a bit of a wait (about 20 min), but nothing out of the ordinary for a Friday night around 5:30 pm. We had another great experience. We found IG family friendly and able to accommodate our two children without disturbing any other guests. Our five year old loved the experience and the food as well. And as parents know, if your children are happy, you are happy. We ordered the (very affordable I might add) lo mein for our daughter. It was good and there were plenty of leftovers between the lo mein and the two entrees we ordered."
5,"Best of Philly is the best place to get an authentic cheese steak in Phoenix, Arizona. John, the owner, is a transplant from the East Coast and he knows what he's doing. Get a regular cheese steak, ask for mushrooms, onions, pickles on the side, or try the bomb steak, or even the pizza steak. They're all exceptional, find or create your own favorite! Good french fries, and free refills on drinks. Check out their website at http://www.bestofphillyaz.com for a discount coupon, print it out for you and your friends and enjoy the best lunch in downtown!"
5,"I take my wife here all the time.  It's a great date place.  The food is always good and the staff is always knowledgeable of the wines and paring them with foods.  We haven't had a bad glass or bottle yet.  My wife likes to order their Cherry Lemon Drop Martini and I have to admit I enjoy it too.

The food is always prepared with care and I've always enjoyed a cheese plate or a Flight of wines with their recommended cheese pairings.

I would like to extend my kudos to Barry.  He is the reason I kept returning as he has what it takes to take the front of the house experience to the next level."
5,"Quick, clean no muss no fuss, keeper!"
1,"I walked into this nail salon hoping for a quick and decent manicure pedicure.  My nail technician, Cathy, was very sweet--however she rushed through everything.  She squirted cuticle remover all over my dress, slobbed it onto my hands and feet and never completely rinsed it off.  She didn't even bother with a top coat on my pedicure.

Her tools were kept all jumbled together in a dirty plastic container--not once did I see her put anything into a disinfectant.  The woman next to me finished with her pedicure and they simply drained the bowl --nobody scrubbed it, or even rinsed it. 

I also thought they had a poor color selection at this place.  All outdated OPI shades.

I wouldn't come here again."
5,This is such a great downtown business!  The owners make you feel welcome and remember your name and your preferences.  They even get peanut butter yogurt samples ready when they see our dog walking up - now that is great service!
1,"This place is horrible.  The sandwhich/paninis can be summarized as follows.  They take some french bread, put maybe a slice of meat or two on it, but no more, and toast it.  They have absolutely no meat on them.  You will leave hungry, along with lunch taking a bite out of your pocket book.  Pricey and bad service.  I have eaten here 3 times, as I used to work in the vicinity, and every time I had absolutely horrible service.  I always have to get up and ask for napkins, refills, silverware, whatever it may be.  Also, there pastry selection is always inconsistent.  I have also had several of their muffins.  They are ok, but not anything special.

I would not recommend this place and certainly will not go back."
1,"Looks like a great store, with reasonable prices - I wanted to get a bouquet primarily based on snapdragons.  I priced out what would be reasonable based on the listed prices, and was told that they have a 2.50 fee PER FLOWER to arrange (meaning take out of the container and wrap in paper) - more than doubling the cost.  I was ready to spend 90 bucks for 2 simple bouquets.  

I have never experienced a flower shop do this.  Most of the time, I walk into a shop, state what I'd like and a price range l, and they would pick and choose for me, making a beautiful paper wrapped bouquet - and charge the per flower price listed.  The guy at this shop simply said ""not going to happen"" and walked away.  At least he could have been nicer.

Such a shame, it seemed to get good reviews, and is conveniently located.

*** turns out the picture I put up was of the wrong guy.  Trying to remove!"
1,"I was there on Monday December 30, 2013.  And I will NEVER be back again.  I waited nearly ten minutes for a person to show up at the counter.  I just wanted a lane and some shoes.  We were told to go to number 8.  When it was not on, we went back to the counter.  No one was there.  I waited another 5 minutes.  I then went into the bar where I found our person too busy to do his job because he was drinking.  From his vantage point he could not see if people were coming in.

In addition to that, he kept pointing and telling me number 8 was on.  He could not see number 8 and was just aimlessly pointing.  Most likely he was drunk.  

Spartan Bowl, get some better staff.  Perhaps ensure that your staff can stay sober."
1,This is the first time Yelp reviews have let me down. I tried this new location due to the reviews and being 5 mins from my job. I opted for a manicure and shellac. Three days later the shellac cracked and began to peel. I called the salon and they asked I return and have the shellac redone. I did and the following day the shellac was cracking and peeling. This has never happened to me with any shellac or other type of gels. This was a waste of money and especially time!!
5,"Seven dollars for a bag of chips and a sadwich is NOT expensive! Maybe for yelpers that think lunch should be purchased from a drive-thru window, but not me!
Good choices-especially on the vegetarian side. Happy to buy coffee for under $2-with refills at only 50 cents. AND, happy to support a local business. 
Call ahead during the lunch rush-it can save you ten minutes. 
Great for families visiting the Science Center-split a sandwich and save some $$."
1,"Not only the worst BK franchise I've ever been to... but probably the worst-managed restaurant franchise I've ever encountered. It's a like a bad (bad) movie...

OPEN ON two guys and a girl in a GREEN SOUL ordering drive through from Burger King on East Wash. They are hungry, but their order is easy. Just three burgers, twp fries, and one drink.

AUDIO OVER (BK INTERCOM VOICE, with a bored lackluster air): ""Okay, drive up to the window.""

The CAR pulls up behind two other cars waiting for their orders. And they wait. And wait. And wait. Six minutes later, the first car finally gets their food and drives off.

The CARS pull up closer. And they wait. And wait. And wait.

A few minutes later, two uniformed BURGER KING EMPLOYEES, one man and one woman, exit the restaurant. They hang out in by the waiting CARS in front of the restaurant. Chatting for a few minutes, then amble back into the restaurant.

The CARS continue to wait. Minutes more pass.

Two more BURGER KIND EMPLOYEES, two women, exit the store with a TODDLER in tow, but they are carrying huge bags of BK food.

The DRIVER of the GREEN SOUL, ""This is ridiculous, we've been waiting over 10 minutes, I'm getting out of here.  Mickey D's is right over there.... Wait... Hey, are those BK employees carrying out FOOD?!""

BURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1, puts up her arm carrying a huge bag of TAKEOUT and uses her body to physically block the GREEN SOUL from leaving. The TODDLER wanders aimlessly and dangerously around the parking lot.

The CAR in front of the GREEN SOUL receives their order finally, and drives off. The CAR waiting for food behind the SOUL peels out of line, barely missing the wandering TODDLER.

BURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting at the CASHIER through the window): ""How long have these nice people been waiting?! 

CASHIER (searching for the order ticket): ""Um... 15 minutes.""

BK EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting): ""Well, give them two free ice creams for making them wait so long!""

SOUL PASSENGER #1 (quietly): ""It's okay, we just want the food we ordered.... And, besides, there are three of us. Not two.""

BK EMPLOYEE (angrily shouting through the cashier window): ""Just get them some ice cream... they were almost going to leave, you guys are so slow. Lucky I stopped them. You're the manager. Manage!""

A few more minutes pass. One single ICE CREAM is passed through the window to the waiting passengers. Then, finally, a BAG with the burgers and fries arrives. The GREEN SOUL drives off down East Wash. Watching carefully to be sure the wandering TODDLER isn't in the way.

SOUL PASSENGER takes a bite out of his burger, and spits it out into a napkin: ""Oh my god! How in the hell did they ruin a Whopper, for chrissakes!? 

SOUL DRIVER: What's wrong with it?

SOUL PASSENGER #1: ""It's cold. And I mean cold. It doesn't taste like meat. It's just rubbery and tasteless... and where's the char-broiled taste? Did they forget to add it? The cheese is in no way melted. There's a wilted mass of white lettuce core shoved in the middle, like a bad surprise. The bun crusty and stale.... do I need to go on--?

SOUL PASSENGER #2, sampling a french fry: ""And my fries are soggy and cold, too.... and no ketchup packets in the bag. And my bun's stale, too!""

SOUL DRIVER starts to laugh: ""that was so bad, I expected cameras to come out of the door next, 'smile, you're on candid camera!""

SOUL PASSENGER #1: ""Or 'Punked.""

SOUL PASSENGER #2: ""We were punked, all right. Let's ditch this sorry excuse for food and order Culver's... the food is always hot and delicious there. And the staff is nice and helpful, too.

The GREEN SOUL exits East Wash, and on the way into CULVER'S, PASSENGER #1 exits the vehicle, and throws the BK bags of food away in the CULVER'S garbage can. 

SOUL PASSENGER #2 getting back into the car: ""Never again.""

SOUL PASSENGER #1 and SOUL DRIVER: ""Never again!""

THE END."
5,"Nice atmosphere and fantastic food!  And I love their gluten free options.  They made things as we ordered them and the service was prompt and friendly.  This is a really nice ""diner"" with nice decor and a very friendly atmosphere.  The line was very long on Sunday morning but that's the sign of anything good because everyone wanted to eat there.  Nom nom, we'll be back! :)"
5,"I've been taking my car here since moving to Phoenix a year ago.  Three things really stand out about this shop:
1. Everyone is professional and very nice.  That's not a given at every auto shop.
2. Honest service - Several times, I've asked them to look at something and to do the service only if it needs it (for example, if my car's manual suggests something at a certain mileage).  Many shops would just take the opportunity to do the service and charge you.  However, Virginia Auto has come back to me several times and said that things look fine now and that they'll check it again at my next oil change.  
3. Burgie will give you a ride back to your work/home!"
5,"The perfect place to relax while you wait to be seated next door at Pizzeria Bianco. The ambiance in this place is thru the roof! Its a real gem, folks. Its intimate, yet inviting. This is the place to get cozy with your date and snuggle with a bottle of wine before your tastebuds explode next door. This joint offers yummy appetizers to munch on with your drinks, or bottled coca cola if you dont drink. (?!?!) Crostadas, prosciutto wrapped mozzarella, cheese platters, and a few other items of delicious-ness are on the menu here. If you wanna impress your date, or try to pull off being a legit foodie, swing by this place!!"
1,"I gave myself an hour to eat dining in before I have to catch a plane. I ordered. I waited 45 minutes. It seemed busy and I was stupid enough to keep waiting even though I see the guy who ordered before me get his and leave 20 minutes in. I didn't have anymore time and asked them to check my order. Nope, the ticket was lost.

I was so hungry and so sad that I couldn't get any ribs. In the state of chaos that the kitchen and staff was in, there was no way they were gonna rush the order out in time even for to-go. I had to get a refund and speed to the airport. For what it's worth I don't think the 1 woman on wait staff was to blame. The owner really threw her under the bus by understaffing on a busy night. There's so many people, so many orders. There was another girl just taking orders. Just standing and waiting, while the other woman ran back and forth with bags and bags of food. What kind of restaurant is this? It's such a weird sight in a restaurant: one girl running another girl standing.  But at least I know she put my ticket into the kitchen. Someone fucked up in the kitchen; someone threw away my ticket. I will not be coming back and will not be sending any friends and family here either. For all the awards the place gets and all its years of being in business, I wish it just wasn't so amateur at being a restaurant."
5,"This is definitely my go to lunch place. I found it on Yelp one day and never looked back. 

I am a creature of habit so I get the same thing every week: A spicy all white meat teriyaki chicken bowl ($6). The portion is SO big. I have never been to any restaurant that actually over serves the meat portion. I typically find myself wanting a little more rice to finish all the chicken with. I love the way the chicken is cooked and the spicy teriyaki is just the right amount of spice. 

I will also sometimes splurge and get some dumplings ($2 with tax) which always come out very hot and taste great with their soy based sauce. It's not a traditional dumpling sauce that I love but it's still pretty good with the dumplings.

The service at this restaurant though is what pushes me to give them a top notch rating. The people here are just such genuinely nice people. They are very helpful and they get your food out quick. I really do not have one con for this place. The prices are amazing for what they offer, the staff reminds me of my own family and they treat you like you are their family and the food is always fresh tasting and yummy."
5,"Yellow curry with chicken:  I dream about this!
Peanut chicken:  fabulous, with more flavor than is imaginable.
Basil chicken:  I think the official name is something else but this is incredibly, memorably good.

Lunch specials are wonderful, but I'm usually there for dinner.  Great service and consistently good Thai food.  Of all the Thai restaurants in town (and I like many of them), this is my FAVE"
1,"Would recommend to not offer a Groupon if you can't answer your phone or return a bloody text message. 3 attempts and nothing. Even went in there to make an appointment. Was given a card and told to call for an appointment. Sure, that worked,. This was counterproductive and a colossal waste of time!

Perhaps you can extend some professionalism and honor your offer. Fortunately, Groupon credited my account. Buyer beware!"
5,"Oh dear god, I'm in love...

Peppered Filet and Martini Scallop dreams fill my mind. Blue Cheese stuffed olives in my martini?? what?? shut the fuck UP!! Sooooo amazing. Quality all the way. I had a glass of Byron Pinot Noir (fabulous) then a white chocolate martini for desert. (I prefer to drink my desert). Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me. 

If you see me at Cheuvront stop by and say hello. I'll be the one in the corner making sweet love to the macaroni and cheese..... no joke."
1,"The item you pick for your dinner can quite literally make or break the experience here.  That is, your cheesy, Americanized Mexican food experience.  I tried the vegetarian tamale and it was nothing less than awful.  No cheese anywhere, no flavor, just HOT.  Ok yes, the menu indicates this a ""spicy"" dish, but it didn't indicate its high degree of suck.  

Unfortunately on this particular visit we didn't get a hot waitress.  Instead we got a disenchanted guy who apparently didn't want a very big tip.  His heavy sighs, eye rolls, and general lack of even being around 99% of the time led me to believe he was channeling his inner emo and couldn't be bothered.  

We were sat next to a group of teenage girls, which by automatic default says ""we hate you and want you to die.""  They talked very loudly about their sexual escapades and did that annoying screech laughing.  I get it, I was a teenager once too, but if I could go back in time I'd kick my own teenaged ass.  

The food, service, and ambiance was like the time I fell off my motorcycle and got really bad road rash.  I hope I won't be doing that again any time soon."
5,I always enjoy seeing a thriving family owned business. We ate the New Yorker with fries and it was delicious. I enjoyed the coleslaw on top of pastrami. The French fries were crispy and appropriately warm. The staff was also very friendly.
5,"Absolutely gorgeous!

We arrived in Madison a little late on a Thursday afternoon and decided to try to make it to the Botanical Garden and squeeze a walk in before it closed.  We, unknowingly, got there at the perfect time - 6:30 pm in the summer yielded some BEAUTIFUL pictures as the sun was a little softer (and not as hot).

We strolled around, hand in hand on our anniversary vacation - it was romantic, quiet, and I felt like I was taking deep breaths for the first time in a very long time.

I cannot recommend this beautiful sanctuary enough"
1,"I saw Whitney Padgett, one of the nurse practitioners. She was okay, but she seemed like she was in a bit of a hurry. In the past my Gyn has always talked to me about calcium, exercise, vitiamins, etc. Whitney did the bare minimum for my history and exam.  I was seen for a preventative exam and also had a small issue at the time. When I was billed it was for a comprehensive preventative exam as well as a level 4 visit. I didn't think one little test and prescription constituted a high-level office visit. When I called to get clarification, the office manager told me that their well woman appointment was just the two female areas- (without getting graphic). I'm sorry, but I am more than just two parts! They shouldn't be allowed to call themselves ""Women's Health Care"" with that attitude."
5,"This place is awesome! The coffee is fantastic. The staff is super friendly, they have comfy seating, plenty of room and free wi-fi. You're made to feel comfortable like it's your neighborhood cafe even if you're a first timer.

The service is wonderful here. I plan to keep coming back any time I'm in the area, I wish they had a better location, though.

It's the perfect place to wait and enjoy some R&R if you're picking someone up from the airport and really it's just a fantastic little place all together."
5,"I've only been here twice, and both times were to see Next to Normal (which was excellent, but that's a totally different review that belongs on a totally different site) this past October. And I'm not going to lie and say ""OH! There's no such thing as a bad seat here!"" because honestly? That isn't true. If you sit on the extreme left or the extreme right, your sight lines won't be the best. 

The best thing they have going for them would definitely be the $10 student rush tickets. So, yeah, you're stuck up in the nosebleeds, which kind of sucks. But it's better than nothing and is great for the theater goer on a shoestring budget. Add in the $3 parking validation for across the street, and I (and my wallet) am smitten."
5,"When I moved away, these were the tacos that I missed! 

I stopped back today, and must say - it was exactly how I remembered!  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced at $5.99 and come with two items and rice and beans. I always get the hard taco - seasoned shredded beef, lettuce, and cheese in a deep fried corn tortilla - and the cheese enchilada. I could eat the rice and beans alone, both are so well seasoned and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese! The only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit - some days it's super hot, others - not so much.

The wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always try to help me because my Spanish is so limited. The interior is large but very modest, there aren't a lot of fancy decorations - this is a place to come for the food and service and  not th ambiance. 

Still, one of my faves!"
1,"About once a week, the husband convinces me that we need pizza.  Ideally, we would get a real one made by people and not a chain.  But, this is often motivated by laziness and downtown Phoenix is the black hole of good pizza.  We would have to drive somewhere to get a good pie, and we're just not having that.

I have a confession to make.  Even though I'm from Buffalo, NY, a city with as many pizza joints as Phoenix has Circle K's, I like Pizza Hut.  It was always the excursion for us growing up.  Sure, we could get a $5 large delivered from the place down the street, but Pizza Hut was an evening out.  A restaurant for pizza, complete with the low-hung light fixtures and the red plastic glasses, it was a special occasion.  And although their pizza was nothing like normal pizza, I developed a special fondness in my tummy for the pan pizza.

And, I'm about to write a review for Domino's as a comparison to this debacle.

We ordered online + 1 star. The website said that it would take 90 minutes - 1 star.

They have blue cheese + 1 star.  The restaurant called to say that they no longer carry blue cheese - 1 star.

We ordered wings that were actually pretty spicy +1 star. They were breaded and had something sweet and sticky on it - 1 star.

The marinara sauce was watered down - 1 star

The delivery guy got lost, forgot the credit card slip and forgot the soda we ordered.  Then he had the nerve to ask me if we still wanted it.  Then he said it would take him an HOUR to return with the pop. -1 stars.

The order was delivered in less than the estimated 90 minutes (minus the pop), he did come back to deliver the 2 liter in less than 30 minutes, and the food was as mediocre as I expected it to be. + 2 stars

I would give a zero if I had to leave the house for this kind of service, but since dinner was delivered they earn 1 star."
5,"It' where you should go to buy and sell games.  Avoid Gamestop and the other chains.  Keep this guy in business.  He isn't always able to buy your stuff, so call ahead of time if you have something specific to sell."
5,"I can't say enough good things about this place.  I've literally never been happier with a haircut - and I used to work at a high-end salon and have had a LOT of haircuts.  Dan is friendly and listens.  I told him how I wanted to look but that I wasn't sure quite how to achieve it.  I told him basically what I was thinking and told him to make a few executive decisions.    Result: Best, most versatile haircut ever.  I've tried a few places  in town - none as good (or a better bargain) than this place.  Will 100% return."
5,"Blue Fin is within walking distance of work so I go once a week, I'd go more but that'd just be silly.  Speaking of silly, I order the same thing every week and all of the staff knows it!!   'The Healthy Special' - chicken teriyaki (white meat), veggies (carrots, broccoli, cabbage) on brown rice with a really amazing Iced Tea.  Delicious down to the last bite!

Locally owned and the staff goes out of their way to be as friendly as possible. Always smiling and always happy to see me. 

It's also right next to a light rail stop which is OH-so convenient!"
1,I hope that a sinkhole opens under this nuisance.  The lack of noise barriers and the racing of unregulated unmuffled cars makes this audible for miles around on Sundays in the summer.  If this was in any other city it would have been closed long ago for noise and pollution inside city limits.  Hopefully the new assistant living community right next door will complain enough that it gets shut down.
1,"Kind of a depressing dive bar - not really my kind of hangout.  If I liked the burger, I'd recommend only ordering it to go.

I went with a patty melt, and was not impressed.  The whole cooking with wine concept may seem like a good idea, and it does make for a slightly interesting flavor, but I wouldn't call it good.  Aside from the wine flavor, the meat wasn't very good anyway, just like the other fixins and the fries.  Combined with the atmosphere and general grungy feeling (I don't know how sanitary the place is, but I wouldn't bet on it passing inspection), I definitely won't be back."
5,"Awesome store.  I don't know much about indoor gardening but thestaff is super helpful and will walk you through the process, hassle free.  They also carry some things for the outdoor gardener as well as some plants (i have cacti and asparagus tips from there).  
Paradigm also carries some fun random things, like frisbees, gourmet chocolates, and handmade soaps and potions from a woman in fond du lac.
Oooh, I almost forgot, they also have workshops once a month, like rainwater harvest and storage, compost tea, and intro to composting. Most are free, except for the pepper workshop, where a man dubbed Dr. Dave brings in dozens of different peppers, shows you how to care for the plants and what you can make with them. Plus you get goodies, like candied peppers, pepper jam, pepper beer, pepper ice cream... On and on. All the workshp info is on the website.
Anyway, awesome store!"
1,"Oh...Macayos.  A once Phoenix staple has turned into complete and utter crap.  I spent many a high school evenings dining here after debate practices and I believe El Presidente Obama ate here within the past few years.  

Things have taken a big turn for the worse.  I mean, you shouldn't expect much with their cheesy decor and a customer base similar to that of Wal-Mart, but it used to be decent - and edible.  

Their menu got smaller.  Its hard to find anything under $11.  The food (even the side of veggies) was SOOO greasy and fatty. Seriously - I feel like I need to eat salads for the next 2 days to compensate for the calorie content of that dish. The baja sauce lost its kick.  The guac had no flavor. I regret eating here."
5,"I simply cannot get over how much I have fallen in love with this place. I have lived in CenPho for several years now and have only just tried Cheuvront in the last four months or so. I mistakenly assumed it was a pretentious wine restaurant but truthfully, it is far from it. 

My first foray was at a Sunday Italian cheese tasting they held over the summer. Around $15-$18, you sampled pre-selected cheeses and had the option of ordering a wine flight with it or anything else to drink. You could also order other food. The tastings began at 3pm, and the best part was the restaurant officially opened at 4pm which began their 4-6pm daily happy hour. Yes, DAILY. Great HH selection, too, between the drinks and food. I am a fan of the one cheese plate for $5, margherita flatbread ($6, I think) and their goat cheese phyllo pockets with a balsamic sauce. God, those are to die for. On the dinner menu, we also tried a bleu cheese mac and cheese that was delicious. 

Since the first cheese tasting, I have been to an American cheese tasting, and most recently a Spanish cheese tasting. It was at the American cheese tasting that I discovered a favorite goat cheese with the consistency of a parmesan. Cheuvront sells their cheeses for about $1.50 an ounce which is very reasonable. I also had a fantastic red sangria that I had to stop at 2 for. So good. 

The service is great, friendly, laid back and approachable. That is how I would describe Cheuvront, overall, too. Check out their website where they have a calendar with their tasting events."
1,"Ok has been 7 months since my 1 star rating.  I thought I'd stop in to buy a new camcorder.  BIG MISTAKE.  One guy working in the department while the store manager and other employees talked at the customer service counter about what they watched on TV last night.  After asking 3 times for the camera guy to request some help, I gave up after waiting 40+ minutes.  I have now sworn to never go back to this store.  I have no idea how they even stay in business."
1,"Damnit! They did it to me again!  I drive in for a simple car wash and end up with more dings on my fenders than Armor All on my tires!  When I brought it up, they dragged nearly every employee on the premises over to my car to take a look. Then one by one they all got Idiot's Amnesia.  Even the bonehead who I watched drive my car up to the conveyor denied he was even in my car! 

As I stood there pointing out the fresh scratches with the paint color that perfectly matched the jagged block wall of their drive path, they all went dumb!

My first experience with this type of senseless customer service at Danny's was a few years back. A manager was pulling my car up to the drying area at a high rate of speed, and I actually watched him sideswipe another vehicle with my car. When I confronted him, and pointed out the fresh patch of rubber rash on my fender from the hit, he denied it...and guess what? He suddenly got that exact same case of Danny's Family Carwash Idiot's Amnesia. Luckily for me I was able to get the rubber patch off so I didn't need to follow up. 

After a recent statewide bust for hiring illegal workers -- TWICE -- you'd figure these morons at Danny's would be a little more willing to curb their bad behaviors and be a lot more customer centric. 

When Danny's Dysfunctional Family Carwash starts offering body and fender repair services along with their mediocre car washes... customers beware!"
1,"I'm a big fan of Schlotzkys, so you can imagine my disappointment when I was confronted by a rude old man at the register about my signature being worn off the back of my debit card.

""Eh, it's time to get a new card huh? Technically I shouldn't take this.""

As if I should feel grateful that he uses the same card that everyone else does to take money from MY account for MY lunch. It just went downhill from there. When I explained that I hadn't signed it, but written ""See ID"" on it, he almost refused to take it. He was short tempered, rude and snobbish. And it was the same sort of attitude and snide commentary the first time I went here.

I won't be going back. I don't need to be insulted and treated like an inconvenience with my lunch. Shame too, it's the only one within two miles of my home."
1,My child in this clinic has been switched from clinicians at least 5 times within the course of 5 months. How do they expect for my child to excel in therapy when he is switched so many times. It takes a child time to adjust to a new clinician and once they get used to them they get switched again. At this clinic they also have speech assistants treat stuttering which they are not qualified to treat. They do not do whats best for the client they do whats best for themselves. When I was given feedback about my child the therapist only took 2 minutes and quickly moved on to there next kid. I feel like a number here and have decided to go some where else. I highly do not recommend this place. There are better places to take your child where it will not feel like they are a number. Don't let yourself fall by all the toys they have in the clinic. Looks can be deceiving.
1,Great if you want to spend $18 to see lots and lots and lots of cactus.
1,"I have traveled all over this wonderful country and stayed in many hotels.  This easily ranks among the worst.  The staff is rude, the room has a weird stench if the AC is not on, and the ""breakfast buffet"" in the morning is a regimented affair with coffee canisters empty or spitting some weird, vaguely brown, lukewarm liquid. The staff will thrust a bag with unidentified contents at you if you do not wish to stay in the dirty, cluttered eating area, and tell you this is what you are ""allowed"" to take.  

Clearly this establishment benefits mightily from its location, so if there is a hotelier out there reading this I suggest you look into Madison as a likely place to put a comfortable inn.  I am sure I am not the only one who would take advantage of such a alternative."
5,"Absolutely amazing... 100% real food, and a menu that can fit almost any dietary need! My partner had the meatloaf (with luscious broccoli--- try saying that in the same sentence), superb homemade gravy, and real mashed potatoes with the skins on them... I had the Cobb salad, and if you are a foodie, you know that Cobb salad is a dangerous thing to put on a menu--- it is difficult to execute properly, and this was perfect. We will be back, again, and again, and again... wish we had found this years ago!"
1,"I defy anyone to find a civil, knowledgeable human being who works in this place. I'd rather be stuck in Newark Airport than shop here."
1,"i have never been treated so poorly in my life. i will never go back to this office ! they are unbelievably rude and have the absolute worst bedside manner i have ever experienced from start to finish.  
even though they had me in their system they could not find my ""chart"" so they decided to charge me new patient prices...even though i was clearly a patient previously. i had spent lots of time on the phone with the finance lady (like a car dealer, odd) telling her exactly what i was coming in for so financially i knew what to expect.... because last time i recieved and $800 bill, yup thats right....$800!!!!! seemed a little excessive for a pap and routine labs...they sure like taking advantage of the cash pay people which is sad especially since i'm sure they do their fair share of ripping off insurance companies. anyway, i was told to come in early for appointment, i wound up waiting over an hour in the waiting room, no one would acknowledge me so i finally asked when they could see me. they soooo so rudely brought me in back to the room. i saw the super rude grumpy nurse practitioner who treated me like i was an airhead. and instead of addressing my issues i was there for she went right into wanting to do bloodwork, cholesterol screening, mammogram, and told me i probably have a pituitary tumor!!!!!! WTF!!! who does that?? she hadnt even done a routine exam at that point. and then told me i didnt know what i was talking about. such a rude rude rude woman. they more interested in doing more labs to make money than anything. so after my horrible experience with that hag i had to deal with the car dealer finance lady who decided to then charge me new patient prices which is more than existing and more than what was agreed upon on the phone. they new and admitted they told me one thing and then made me pay another . they really are rotten people and i hate when people get into any kind of health care knowing people are ailing but they dont have the temperment to deal with it long term so they walk around like a bunch of grumpy sourpusses in the office and make patients coming in with issues feel like we're a burden! isn't that what they signed up for??? try to be a little kinder rude ladies, its probably because they're all hitting menopause in there right now"
1,"I just don't get it.  this place is like a homeless shelter but with even worse food.   I know it's southern style....but EVERYTHING is double fried...and you walk out of their feeling like death.

It's expensive ($25 pp with soda) and just not quality food.

this is worth a big SKIP...."
1,"I would like to rate the work here, but sadly I can't. The sign on the door states that they open at 9am. I had some time before work and thought I would get a quick mani pedi. I waited for 20 minutes and they never opened. As a small business I would expect they would want to be open during posted business hours to bring in new customers. 

I won't give them a chance to waste my time again."
1,"With 32 reviews and 4.5 stars I had high hopes. We were sorely disappointed. 

The Restaurant:  Dated decor, Christmas lights everywhere (in Feb). Poor layout. 
The Drinks:  bad wine and poorly made vodka cocktail made this a waste of time. 

The Food:  Mediocre would be a compliment. The ziti and tortellini were terribly underseasoned. The salad was lettuce carrots and oil. Even the bread was subpar. 

The Service:  Our server started off well but went downhill fast. No recommendations, MIA for 20 minutes and taking ""the food wasn't too bad"" as a compliment made this experience unenjoyable. 

The Price:  There's not much worse than over paying for lackluster food.  I can cook better at home. 

The Verdict:  Any other Italian restaurant is a better choice. Pick the next one."
5,"We love Bavarian! They have serviced two of our BMWs. They always do a thorough, honest job. The car often needs less than BMW says it does. Bavarian tells you straight what is really necessary & charges a very fair price. Go to them over the dealership every time. Highly recommend them."
1,"Not good. And it's not been for a couple of years. There are advantages: good location, rarely busy, good for larger groups. But last few times we've been there have experienced average food and lousy service.  When joining my already seated group on Saturday (3/28) the high-school hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard, the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wife's chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only 2 measly pieces of chicken in it.  Only 2 beers on tap. Garbage."
5,"I heard about this guy Sarah K. went out with on 12/12. They didn't quite click, but he sounded up my alley. We totally hit it off and had all kinds of romantic dinners and wild nights. Then we got married and made tons of babies and they all grew up to become supreme court justices. This is how I feel about Fate."
1,"Unbelievably disappointed.  I'm in town for business, and went on a week night.  They were not terribly busy, but as a solo diner, I was treated quite poorly.  Mostly ignored during my meal, I had to get up to chase someone down just for a water refill.  Not once did anyone check on my meal (I would have loved a second glass of wine), which wasn't stellar anyway.  
I did stop and tell the woman at the front that not every diner has the luxury of being able to eat with family or friends, and that I felt my service was horrible.  Maybe it'll spare the next person eating alone and hoping for good service.
I travel to Madison Wi frequently for work, and I can tell you that they'll not get repeat business from me."
5,"great neighborhood staff, the family that runs is  very hardworking serious about their bussiness and satisfying customers. thanks,"
5,"This is a great place to have fun.

A great variety of music, mostly country, but good dancing country from the two step, to the ""neon moon"" song dance (cuz I don't know the name of that dance. lol), to coordinated dances to certain songs, and then just shaking your bootay to Madonna or something like that.

Nice big dance floor and a good amount of seating.

Smoking area out the side doors that's new where you can bring your drinks... nice touch since that new law came in.

Bartenders are really nice and the drinks are strong.  The draft beer seems to get you drunker than normal for some reason... not sure why.

Great place even to bring straight people... my friends always seem to have a blast when they go.

Just really needs better parking. But that's not too much of an issue."
1,Disappointed. Suzie was very rushed. About 10 minutes into my appointment another girl walked in for her appointment. Suzie sent her to go get her feet done in the meanwhile. This is the worst my nails have looked
1,"I'm a little disappointed, it seems like I've eaten here before and it wasn't so bad.   The caesar salad dressing tasted mostly of mayo.  They cooked my medium steak pretty well, but turned out they had switched my friend's steak and mine and his was supposed to be medium rare.  I feel a steak restaurant should know how to cook a steak.  The mashed potatoes were lumpy.  They tasted ok, and did not feel pasty but could've used some kind of flavor.  The green beans were actually pretty good.  The salmon was cooked well but the citrus based sauce was a bit too sweet.  The sauce that came on the steaks was better, but didn't have much flavor.  The steaks themselves could've used a bit of salt and pepper.

The creme brulee was pretty tasty as always but I wasn't a fan of the flourless espresso chocolate cake.  

All in all, I don't think the experience and food is as put together as their competitors.  The waitress also seemed a bit joyless which didn't help the experience.  With so many better options, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.  Maybe for lunch?"
1,"I was really disappointed at my experience here. It looks nice enough, kind of like a Hard Rock Cafe. The wait staff were dressed comfortably, even if they have to wear eyeliner stuff under their eyes. They were very nice. That's about it for the good stuff. When someone orders the Big Unit (made famous by Man vs Food), a super annoying bell goes off and all the wait staff stop what they're doing and yell ""BIG UNIT!"" That got old after the third one. I definitely couldn't work there. The big disappointment, though, was the food. I got the BBQ sampler thing and my husband got nachos. The tortillas were soggy and when you picked one up, everything slid off it so all you got was soggy wet chips and no toppings. Even when you scooped it up with a fork or whatever, the toppings didn't taste very good. As for mine-it all tasted like (and had the texture of) stuff that had been cooked in a boil-in-the-bag meal. The sauce was SUPER sweet, and none of the meat had the slightest flavor or appearance of having been even wafted through smoke. All I really ate were the fries, and they were the battered kind, which are gross. All in all I was super, SUPER disappointed and won't be back OR recommend this place to others."
5,"Hands down the best ribs I've had in my life.  My first visit here was about a year ago.  Though I was a little afraid of the area and the sketchy look of the place I was taken by a good friend and my visiting father so I couldn't say no.  We all ordered sandwiches; I had the brisket and my father ordered a half order of ribs for us to share.  Now I have to say I'm not a BBQ person.  I'm not a fan of 99% of the sauce out there.  I reluctantly gave it a try and almost had to sit on my now saucy hands to keep from eating the whole plate.  The brisket was decent, but nothing compared to the ribs.  I've been here probably about 25 times since my first visit and now exclusively get ribs.  The sides in my opinion aren't really worth mentioning.  The coleslaw had as much black pepper in it as any other ingredient and the cowbro beans are kinda spicy.  The mac n cheese is good, not kraft or velveeta but not special.  The ribs are definitely the way to go for a happy full belly."
1,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE catfish taste like crunchy cardboard. HORRIBLE customer service in the van buran location. If you want some really good catfish papa joes is AWESOME!!! It's actually worst than one star, and they BOIL there ribs. SMH!!"
1,"There was a time, when service at this company was excellent. I have used this company for over 10 years. I went down a couple week ago because my pool sweep wasn't working. The person at the counter, was pathetic when it came to providing service. My wife went back to pick the pool sweep, the guy that waited on her was eating his lunch at the front counter. She said she would never go back there again, because the service was so poor. My pool sweep was under warranty they told me, there was nothing wrong with the sweep, it just need to be cleaned. They charged me 20.00 to clean it. When I put it in the pool it still had the same problem. I took it to Leslie Pool Supply they took it a part while I was there replaced a couple parts put it back together and didn't charge me, because it was still under warranty.  It works now. I have spent my last dollar with Checker.. guess who my new pool company is!"
5,What a great menu and patio... The commemorativo margarita is great...
5,"I love this place! Bad for my cholesterol but who gives a damn! The proprietors are very cool, great ambience in ""the hood."" It puts the soul in soul food; can't wait to hang out there again soon as my Lipitor digests; just cool as it gets in Phoenix"
5,"When I have a friend or relative visit from non southwest places they all want to come here and they all love it. 

It is set very nicely with good displays and explains a lot of what one might not know.

The gift shop too is a nice stop before we continue on our day."
1,"I've been buying gas, details and car washes at various Danny's for 7 years while putting up with their never ending requests to fix my windsheld every time I go in.  

Today was the first time that I needed to ask for a raincheck car wash after getting one last Saturday right before the duststorm.

Apparently you have to go in 72 hours after your car wash, NOT get rained on within 72 hours, which effectively makes the guarantee useless. Its been impossible to get in all week.

After all the money I've spent with them, which they clearly track via license plate, it was a big let down from a customer loyalty standpoint, enough to the point that I doubt I'll go back."
5,Nice restaurant with a lot of great vegetarian and vegan options. The food is healthy and they try to accommodate any special requests you may have. The prices are very reasonable as well.
5,"Love the selection in their clearance section.

After a minute of scanning the shelves, I walked out with the collected works of John Donne, some Emily Dickinson, a doorstop fantasy novel by Daniel David Abraham, a hilariously dated sci-fi book about the future of gaming from the 80s by Melissa Scott, and one of Adrian Tchaikovsky's fast moving pulp novels, all for six dollars."
5,"I had attempted to go to Monty's Blue Plate Diner the last time I was in town, but it was so crowded that I was deterred and ended up at Ella's Deli for possibly the worst omelet of my life.  This time, I was determined to wait it out at Monty's for as long as it took - which ended up being only ten minutes at around 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday.  The wait was well worth every second.  My breakfast companion and I had the meatless meatloaf - a melange of carrots and other vegetables, covered in a cashew and sage gravy - and a caponata omelet, filled with a stew of perfectly-cooked, still-easily-recognizable vegetables and a pesto sauce made from basil grown out back.  Each bite of each dish was a delight.  I took home a slice of Reese's peanut butter cheesecake which I am hoping my son will find to be too rich for him because, uh huh!  That means I get to polish it off.  Can't wait to get back to Madison for another go-round at Monty's!"
5,"I can't say enough good things about this place!  My husband, son and I go there at least once a month and it is always delicious and they take such good care of you!  Some restaurants look at you when you walk in with a little one and grimace they are always joking with our son and making him, and us, feel very comfortable!  The food is SOOO good - not a bad thing on the menu!  If you're looking for a great Indian meal in a great atmosphere with fantastic staff this is the place!"
1,Who is flagging down all the one-star reviews for The Harmony Bar? To anyone considering patronizing this establishment: read the flagged reviews.
1,"I ordered a birthday cake for the first time through Clasen's. Due to the flu going through our house, I had to reschedule the party and the cake for the following week. the Baker did not get my cancellation and baked the cake. Clasen's said they were sorry and not to worry about it. When I picked up the cake the following week it was stale. my guess is they just kept the cake in the fridge until I picked it up the following Friday. I called to let them know they apologized and said they would call me back. I never heard from them. :( Disappointing."
5,We come here for all the Arizona Cardinals game every away game and are so happy with the food and service. Their new general manager has really turned the place around and the servers are all professional and friendly. Highly recommend!
1,"We have gone here in the past year four times and they are always out of ice cream. It doesn't matter the time of day. This last week we went to get ice cream and food. Ordered chicken tenders they were out. OK can we have four cheeseburgers no we are out of buns. Well what can we get, whatever you want. We just left after all that."
1,"Unfortunately, we had to stay here during the week of Epic's UGM 2013 conference.  

My room was dirty.  The rooms had a stale, mildew smell.  The shower/tub looked like it had a layer of grime that needed a lot of scrubbing and disinfectant.  

The few positives about this place are: 1) free HBO; 2) it is located near a handful of restaurants.  

I hope this will be my first and last time staying in an Econo Lodge.  Ugh."
5,"Working 3rd shift and this is the closest place that is open. Overnight staff is quick and nice. They don't mind that I order to go, and usually offer me a soda or other beverage while I wait. Definite staple in my 3rd shift diet."
5,"This place is only open at night.  Like 5-9pm.  The owner is always working.  He can tell you everything about anything in the store.  He's helped me learn alot about scotch and wines.  Thanks Mike.  Fair prices, great deals (he's got an orphan bin for wines) and Mike will work with you if you are on a low budget to find something that is quality for the price.  awesome."
5,Had lunch here. Great food and great service.
1,Read a review from the newspaper so I tried it. Not impressed. The atmosphere is about as dismal as the food. They need to make it a place people want to come in and eat instead of get out of there as soon as possible. Gross!
1,"miserable experience

snarky jerkoff of a waiter

mediocre food in small portions over salted and lukewarm

crappy ordinary and overpriced wine list

one of the worst meals in scottsdale ever!"
1,"This is the dirtiest and mostly disorganized Best Buy I've ever been to.   Today it took some girl in customer service 10 minutes to look up whether they had a PC game I wanted.  As it turns out, the game hits shelves tomorrow, not today, but I had to go to 5 stores to figure that out.  The folks at Best Buy said they would not carry it, which is hilarious since I know they'll carry it since it's an expansion pack for a top-selling game they have on the shelves.

In the words of Napolean Dynamite: ""Gosh, idiot."""
1,"I find these 5 star reviews to be incredibly suspicious. We just got back from returning our ***70 dollar take-out order*** (which consisted of 2 gnocchi, 1 bolognese, and 1 linguini and clam sauce, by the way) to a very rude and egotistical owner. We called beforehand to merely voice our concerns about this incredibly expensive, yet mediocre meal. The owner answered the phone and was not only unconcerned, but was very argumentative, saying that he ""only gets a complaint once every 2 months"" and that he has a ""packed house."" He made us feel like our opinions didn't matter in the least bit. He begrudgingly told us to bring our food back for a refund, so we did just that. When we arrived, he met us outside and argued with us a bit more, emphasizing that his 20 seat restaurant was full. When we tried to explain our concerns with the food, he said ""whatever"" and left, shortly returning with our refund.
Food:
-Clam and fettuccine-far too salty
-Tomato sauce- tastes like canned
-Gnocchi-mushy, no texture
-Bolognese-no flavor

Bottom line:
-Rude, arrogant owner
-Bland,over-priced food
-Never returning!!

I really didn't want to have to write this review, since I live in the neighborhood and want this place to be good. Before it appeared on Food Network, although expensive, this place was quite good. I just don't want anyone else to waste their time and money when there are so many other good Italian restaurants to eat in Phoenix. (e.g. Aiello's)"
1,"I went to @coachnwillies last night, as part of the @downtownphoenix spring fling pub crawl.
Coach & Willies is the reason negative ratings should be possible on @yelp.

I will never, ever return.

When we arrived, we ordered a beer, and a soda.

We also ordered nachos. They were piled high. This is a good thing.

Removing the first couple chips resulted in a couple olives falling on to the bar. I wiped them into a pile, but figured I'd wait until I was done, to catch anything else, and clean it up.

A few of us decided to have a shot, to celebrate a birthday-in-progress. I flagged one of the bartenders down.

He approaches me and says ""Are you gonna stop making a mess on my bar?""
Me: ""Excuse me?""
BT: ""You're making a mess""
Me: ""I would like to order a drink, not get hassled""
BT: ""I don't care about your drinks, I only care about your tips""
Me: ""Well you're not exactly working for one at the moment""
BT: ""Are you going to order or not?""

I placed my order without any further comments, lest I inform him of my true feelings.

He takes my credit card and asks if I'd like to keep it open. I tell him no, because I have left my card in the past.

He returns with the receipt. On the ""tip"" line I write ""NoFuckingWay!""
I work in a service industry. You don't treat me like shit and still get a tip. Fuck you.

A while later I go to order a beer. This same motherfucker tells me I'm cut off.

Yes, I am cut off.

I have had maybe three beers, and a shot, in 5 hours.

I ask another bartender, and as he is about to pour me a beer, the first SOB hollers to him that I am cut off, then proceeds to show him my receipt.

Because, apparently, you not giving a tip is justification for him being a cocksucker.

I demand to see a manager, and one comes over. I tell him that the guy is cutting me off because I refused to tip him, and he tells me that the problem is that there is a $10 minimum on CC transactions.

Curiously, that isn't stated anywhere. Further, this ""manager"" took my first beer order, when I arrived, and made no mention of the minimum when I bought just the one beer, nor did the other bartender mention that when I paid for the shots, which actually totaled $24.

This ""manager"" was gracious enough to let me pay their establishment for service again. /sarcasm

I will recommend to every single person I know to never patronize that establishment, and I will never return to a place with such puerile and petty employees."
1,"Phoenix Zoo employee Brandon (white male in his 20s). who was working the front gate called me a Dick. 

You are not gonna believe this, I'm still in shock. Worst interaction with any employee ever. 
My mother was visiting here from out of town and we decided to take my 2 1/2 year old my mom and myself to the Phoenix Zoo today.
We got there at noon and purchase the Wild Ride bands.  We spent all day at the zoo and were exhausted at the end of the day. It was 5PM and the zoo was closing so we were making our way to the exit. I had my 2 1/2 yr old daughter in a wagon and had pulled her around the zoo, I've been to the zoo several times and know that they want most traffic to exit through the gift shop but I didn't want to lug around my wagon into the gift shop, instead I preferred to exit through the entrance so I made my way towards the entrance to exit.  There was one young guy standing right in the middle of the gates and he said to me are you looking for the exit and I said well I want to exit here instead of going through the gift shop because I don't want to roll this wagon through there and he responded sorry you have to this is not an exit. I wasn't turning around though so I kept walking toward the left side of the gate, he was still standing in the middle of the section and said you can't exit here and I said, well listen this gate here opens can you just open it? (I waited for him to come over and offer to help but he stood fast where he was and said no)
When I realized he wasn't going to accommodate I started to work the latch and I said it opens this way right (pulling instead if pushing)? he says No, then I pushed and it opened and he said it opens that way.
(At this point I wasn't mad, just wanted to leave). As I opened the gate and rolled through I said I am not going through the gift shop with my daughter and this wagon, when you have kids you'll understand, to which he replied; ""maybe you should learn how to say no."" I stopped in my tracks and turned to him (still leaning against the turn style) and I said ""Maybe you should mind your own business."" Then I turned around again and heard; ""maybe you shouldn't be such a Dick."" WOW I was really speechless that an employee would say something like that in front of my child!!!! Of course physical contact is out of the question so I said ""do you like working here because today's your last day buddy.""
He looked and rolled his eyes, I said get your manager out here right now and he said ""No."" So I noticed his radio was sitting on the gate right in front if him so I walked up to grab it and he said oh no and took it. I turned around looking for someone and no one was there so I started to call the zoo on my cell phone and just then an employee was walking in the office and I waved her down from the outside she came out and I explained what just happened and the she said OK hold on and went back in to return moments later with a supervisor, I didn't catch her name but she came out and shook my hand and introduced herself. 
I explained what just happened and she looked at the employee and waited for his response.  He said I walked up and asked for him to open the gate and then I just opened the gate and walked out. He totally denied everything after that and didn't admit anything! Crazy right?!
I've gotta say in hindsight this supervisor didn't handle this effectively. The first thing she started to explain to me was their gate/exit policy saying how they do ask all guests to exit thru the gift shop and that the only reason the entrance gate is open is because of the fire code...I kind of interrupted her and said ""you don't have to explain that to me..."" Then just asked what's your policy if a guest insists on exiting here are you required to allow it and she said yes. OK then that's end of story this guy did nothing and was very inappropriate and she said ""well this is a he said she said and we will have a talk with him. ""
When I got home I told my wife what happened and she was furious, she said you paid to have a good experience there and an employer was not only rude to you for no reason but used bad language in front of your child and no one apologized to you or offered you anything. What kind of experience is that???
So I decided that first I need to notate what happened so I don't forget, second I am going to place a call tomorrow to the park manager and discuss what took place.
I was real exhausted today and just wanted to leave and didn't take the time to think about how I should of handled this.

Update to this review:
I called the Zoo Tuesday morning and left a message for Jennifer which is Janelles supervisor but she never called me back, so I called the zoo Wed and asked for Jannelles boss Bonnie and left her a msg in the AM and no one called back. If I hear something I will update this review."
1,"I called this store to inquire if they had a Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM in stock.  They said they had a few.  I asked if they could get anywhere close the amazon's price.  He asked how much they were selling it for, and i replied $339.   He then started yelling at me that they are losing $40 on the lens, and good luck.  He was rude started bitching to me.  I asked could you do any better, and he basically said good luck and hung up the phone.  

Get with the program.  The price of the lens is $399 retail.  Don't tell me you only make $20 on a lens sale.  I want to support local businesses, but I'm not going to drive 20 minutes to over pay for something I can have overnighted to me for $60 cheaper.   What is really ridiculous about the whole thing is I also ordered a $1100 L glass lens from amazon as well, which I paid full retail for.  They could have had both orders, if he didn't treat me like sh*t. 

If you want to survive as a local business, you need to be nice to your customers.  If you don't want to price match then be nice about it.  Don't try to bully someone into  buying something.  If you know a customer is just going to order it, I think you would be better off selling it and only making $20, then losing that business and any future business from the customer.  I have personally spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on photography equipment, always the highest end lenses, and camera bodies.  In fact I bought my last camera body at their store, but I will never make that mistake again.  

You lost my business for good, and I am sure I will not be the last one."
1,"Wendy's new BREAKFAST blows!

I've never been a huge fan of Wendy's food, however seeing their big window sign of their new breakfast sandwiches drew me in.  My God they looked good!  And my God was I disappointed.  

I had a sausage biscuit with a kick ass looking buttermilk bun that was infused with syrup.  The meat was spicy (ala McDonnalds) but the rest was just yucky.  I highly recommend you skip Wendy's for breakfast.  Bummer."
5,I was pulling a U-Haul trailer from Michigan when my van started to lose power on I-90 in Madison.  I saw that I was leaking transmission fluid and began to look for a nearby transmission service garage.  When I got to Eastside Transmission the first thing I noticed is they keep a very clean shop.  There were only two techs on duty and were busy.  Dan quickly looked at the two vehicles ahead of me then came over to look at my car within minutes.  He took time look it over well and determined that the transmission was getting hot and discharging fluid out the overflow line.  He said I needed to let it cool and take it out of over-drive and I should be fine.  I was on my way in 20 minutes and didn't even charge me for the diagnosis.  We made it home without further problems.  It's nice to find a good honest shop when you're away from home and need immediate service!
1,"Im very confused about all these good reviews.

Last night my girlfriend brought me to Jt's, her boss said the wings were great. So I figured I'll try it.
When we get there, the lot is filled, I figured this is a good sign. But that where the optimism ended.
We had to sit near the back, the smell and temperature were almost unbearable, but I figured I wanted to try the food. My girlfriend ordered wings, she wanted ranch, I only eat wings with Blue Cheese, then I get a burger and onion rings... And a coke. 

After a long wait, the server brought us our drinks, in a red solo cup, and my coke was not coke, but RC Cola... So far, its not going well. 
The waitress comes back a little later to let us know, there's no more onion rings.

After a long wait, we finally get the wings, as she sets them down, thats when she lets me know there's no more blue cheese. If I was by myself, I would have left at that point, I was also hungry. 

My burger came, it was one of those pre made paddies you get at cosco, I lifted the bun and the whole patty fell apart. The cheese was some sort of burned shredded cheese. 

I counted the 'fries' I received with he burger, I counted 12 small pathetic fries. 

These wings everyone talks about were burnt and dry, this confuses me the most. 
I mentioned to my girlfriend that I don't think her boss likes her, people must send patrons there when they dislike them. 

With all the places in the valley to get really good wings, good service and other good dishes, I put this mystery of why people rave about this place up there with the mystery of the pyramids... 

Ugh, I still cant get the image of that sorry burger out of my mind!"
5,"Enjoyed a little local culture yesterday with a friend of mine.  

Sometimes I forget that we actually have some great history here in the Southwest.  It was awesome just soaking it all in! 

Tons of amazing dolls and hand-crafted jewelry caught my eye first.  Lots of beautifully executed baskets and clothing on display, among clay pots with intricate carvings and/or painting.  

Presently, there is a Georgia O'Keefe exhibit featuring some of her lesser known works with a more Southwestern flare.  It was refreshing to see something other than the flowers she's so popularly known for.  They have a 12 minute video about her, too which gave some insight into her almost 100 year life. 

I highly recommend going to the Heard Museum to get your culture fix."
1,"I came through this dive while pub-crawling amongst friends. As we lined up at the bar to order beers and grub -- the bartender's muttering under her breath ""oh shit."" should have tipped us off to the piss poor service that awaited us. Apparently they're not accustomed to seeing a group of ~12 people waltz in this dump. Go fig'. Mind you, we were very accommodating, and considerate of the surprise rush we created. However, when they served our table separately and completely forgot my food, I was forced to demand a refund. They're lucky I wasn't a complete a**hole and demanded the portion of the tip that I already paid toward my food order.

Sure, if you're looking for a very lonely dive all to yourself and a /few/ friends, this might be your place. But for us, it was a complete and utter disaster.

Oh, did I mention the incessant flies throughout the establishment? Yeah, not cool."
1,"UPDATE!  

Ever since my last review where I described being backpack violated for carrying rice cake contraband, I've made it my mission to sneak in as much snack contraband as I can every time I go here.  

Today I stopped at Walgreens before heading over to the theater, and bought 3 large boxes of candy for 3 bucks!  Yes!  The same candy in the same size boxes that they sell at the theater for 4.25 a piece!  That's a 9.75 savings to me Eastgate, and YES I like stuffing boxes of candy down my pants!  I like it!!"
1,"I went to this shop based on the high ratings. 
12 days later, 2 loaner cars, $1200, many excuses, a second opinion that found the problem in minutes, and 3 chances later, the issue of new front struts and squeaking and rocking upon braking persist. The car has not felt remotely right since it was in their hands. Will go to second opinion Tobias in Cave Creek next time. They seem far more on top of things."
5,"load up on fresh fruits and veggies here.

their seafood is cheap and good!

try their aqua frescas for refreshment during the hot summer!"
5,"This place is outstanding.  Not in a real good neighborhood but who cares.  The menu is great.  We even get the meat alacarte to go with homemade toritillas and bring home for another dinner.  The price is inexpensive.  Everything taste great. I am from San Diego,CA and this place almost is like I'm at home(Arizona mexican food is not the greatest if you are raised in CA.)  I found my home"
5,"Any place that's located on a lake for a fish fry is alright with me.. It's packed on Friday which means you get to have a few cocktails while waiting for a table, the wait is worth it... Don't hesitate to try this place out you won't be disappointed.."
1,"The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Not only did they serve us EXTREMELY salty food - for all three dishes and one EXTREMELY SOUR- we had three people in our party, so it's not just my opinion- when we told them to try it, they said it suits out taste and refused to cancel the charge until after thirty minutes of disputing with them. WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. (Btw Chinese people at our table so they actually know what it's supposed to taste like)"
5,"I can't say much about this place because I do the same damned thing every time.  Pull up to the drive through window, smile at the nice lady, order a teriyaki combo or two and some rolls, and peel out with my food in two minutes or less.

I can't imagine it's the toughest thing in the world to make consistently good teriyaki, but I'll tell you what, those people are friendly every damned time I roll through.  And the food is always still hot and delicious when I plop down on my sofa to dig in.  Oh, and the salad dressing for the combo salad is yum.  God, I think this place might have been around back when I was in high school.  Way to keep it rolling!  Five stars, baby!"
5,"Highlights/lowlights

1) friendly staff
2) fun thing to do on a nice summer night
3) gluten free food options available

I think it's really important to head in to your first (or any) mallards game with the right mind set. This isn't MLB! If you want that that head to a Brewers game in Milwaukee (NOT a Cubs game at Wrigley :p). 

As this is not MLB, the stadium is smaller and really easy to navigate through. I would imagine this would be really good for families looking for a night out. There is a decent sized kids area near the entrance as well. 

For a smaller stadium there is a really impressive amount of food and drink options. There are over 17 different beers available plus people selling Seagrams escape drinks (supposedly gluten free!), lime-a-Ritas etc. I was expecting pretty limited options for food as this is a smaller stadium but they really have everything you can get at an MLB game. Brats, burgers, chicken sandwiches, even cheese curds! There are even gluten free hamburger AND brat buns. Basically a food coma waiting to happen for anyone with celiac disease/gluten intolerance. The staff at all the food and drink stands was really friendly and quick!

Wisco fans everywhere are pretty chill but even more so here! Everyone is just here to have a good time and nobody gets really competitive about the game.

With plenty of food and drink options and great fans, a Mallards game is a great choice for a night out on a nice night!"
1,"All I can say is - never again! I only use them because I am pregnant and not supposed to be lifting things. However, the past 2 times they were 3 hours late delivering - when they had a 5 hour window to begin with! In addition, this time they used fragranced soap which I am allergic to, and I will need to get it rewashed. For such an expensive service, they give you absolutely zero customer service."
1,"NOT JUST THE WORST SERVICE, BUT NO SERVICE AT ALL!

What was once a perfectly fine establishment has taken a major decline this year. I've been going here for the past three years to watch the Packers on game day. The food has always been exceptional and the service wonderful

This year it's sucks far below acceptable levels.

Two weeks ago we sat at our table and we waited 40 minutes until we saw our server. And this only after my girlfriend went to the bar and explain our situation.

This week I sat down (in a sparely populated bar) and after not being given a menu, asked for a drink order or even acknowledged I decided not to go to the bar and wait and see just how long this would last. I watched an entire three quarters of a football (2+ hours) without ever so much as being acknowledged as existing! When I sat down table next to me was covered with the last customers leftovers and was not cleared until right before I left by what I assume was my waiter. In doing so he walk right past me and my empty table TWICE never to return.

UTTERLY PATHETIC"
5,I went in to get my Viper remote replaced because my other two stopped working and instead of just selling me a new one right away the owner tried to see if it was battery or something else. I like the honesty of that and he was very friendly and fast and replacing the remote and re-programming it to my car. I highly recommend this place!
1,"Booo! 

I can't stand Sprint. Not to go all ""Consumer Reports"" on Yelp, but my report is that Sprint is an unethical, slimey, seething parasite to our society.

They ""fine print"" you to death, so that before you know it your once manageable phone bill now has ballooned beyond your most pessimistic expectations. 

They change phone plans, so that you can't switch up or down for anytime minutes without taking a serious hit. 

On top of that, they make you renew your contract for two years every time you need to adjust your plan. 

Nightmarish - that's the word I was reaching for."
1,"I asked for fill with gel top and the guy starts to do the gel and goes straight to polish. I say what about the gel he says this is gel. I said no that's polish you have to do gel. He does not!! I go to pay & the charge me for gel! I tell them that Ryan didn't use the gel just the polish. They said that is what they do so it's not thick. Well HELLO THATS NOT GEL. Don't you think you should have a choice, after all your paying the same for not even getting what you asked for. After 1.5 hours I get to go back tomorrow what joy!! Don't get Ryan. I can't say anything about anyone else until tomorrow."
1,Went yesterday for the first time. It gets one star because the food was yummy. Got the choose two- Nine Iron sandwich with Mediterranean salad. Very good. Lost a star because parking is horrible despite the free but really not free valet parking. Lost a star because I do not like eating up. Meaning the table was so low you have a lot of distance to the mouth and more opportunity to spill. Lost a star because I don't like eating in my living room. Why are restaurants now making their dining room a living room? If you want to do the sofa and chair thing do it outside. Not fond of high tops either. Lost a star because they opened the garage door. We chose to sit inside for a reason. They opened it and all of a sudden it was 60 degrees.
5,"Great wine and cheese and really nice atmosphere, our waitress Laura was very knowledgeable and professional."
1,Not so great.  The hot wings were not good. The flavor was bland and had hardley any sauce.  I had the stuffed numero one-o that tasted very bland and had too much cheese so it melted on my plate. The person next to me had the thin crust which looked pretty good. The wait was extremely long which eould have been okay if food had been worth it. On top of it all it was a little pricy for pizza. I would not recommend this place.
1,"They added broasted chicken to their menu... I love me some broasted chicken, so in I went to investigate.

I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken.

To me it tasted rubbery and had a strange odor, and it was so salty that an hour later I could still taste it. I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted.

I can't speak to anything else on the menu. Their garlic knots, for what it's worth, were fine."
1,Seeking an investor and keeping the well established business open seems like a better alternative in my eye. Giving up doesn't seem fit.
1,"Best decision I made was moving OUT of this place! Before I moved in the complex was managed by Greystar then switched over to Alliance. The morning I was scheduled to move in, the people working the front office had no idea what keys to give me and after I told them I had to leave to meet the movers they agreed to give them to my brother- which they did but without checking his ID to make sure he was the person they were supposed to give them to. 

The complex grounds and the surrounding areas where people walk their dogs always has dog feces and there seems to be a shortage of doggy bags the majority of the week. The security gates stay broken like they have given up on trying to fix them. The drive in gates and clickers are questionable as to when they they work- the last months of my lease after trying to get a clicker that worked from the main office several times, I gave up on having a functioning one. The complex itself has a high turn over with people leaving in the middle of the night- there would be drunk people who don't live at the complex hanging out by the pool mooching off residents- police rolled through on more then one occasion- weekends were debatable on if you would be woken up at 3 am by people vomiting in their driveway- questionable as to if there are any background checks that got one on potential residents. 

They say they are pet friendly but only in the sense they use it to charge you as much as possible. Make sure you don't have ANY stain of any type on your carpet because if you do they will replace all the carpet in the unit on your expense at move out. At inspection, I was told the carpet in the guest bedroom would be replaced but ended up getting a bill for ALL the carpet in the unit. If you can have someone with you during your walk through, do it- that way you'll have a witness who can support you if they try to charge you for stuff other than what they told you during the inspection.

Make sure you know your lease- I had signed a short lease and upon verifying my move out date, discovered they had me down for a lease almost 6 months longer then what I signed up for. Also be aware that they will jack up your rent when it comes to renewing- I knew many people that left because they could no longer afford the constant increases. 

The place I live at now is managed by Greystar and I can tell the difference. My new place is much bigger then Palazzo but the grounds are well kept, little noise, there is a constant presence of maintenance staff and the management team, I pay less for rent and enjoy little things like secure property gates, a mail box that you can actually drop mail off in, and staff that follows up and follows through. Palazzo is mediocre at best- if you look around, you can find places that offer the same and more amenities with better quality."
5,"The Wild Thaiger is the best kept Thai restaurant secret on North Central Avenue.  My first culinary experience at Thaiger was several months ago with co-workers. My omnipresent dinner companion Marcial and I, have been habitual customers since.

Office employees flock to Wild Thaiger during the week for lunch and bring a few close friends or relatives back at night or on the weekend to share their secret.  The restaurant atmosphere is very friendly and unpretentious.  

The food is where the adventure begins. For a flaming start, Tom Yum Goong is a must of any visit to Wild Thaiger.  The soup is a concert of spicy hot lemony flavors that leave you wanting more.  Don't fret, you can always order more to go.
Dragon's Eggs are paramount on our list of favorite's starters These Dumplings are stuffed with pork and crab, wrapped in tender wrapping, nestled in fresh vegetables and comes with a seasoned dipping sauce. 

The Lunch and dinner menu is delectable and you will want to try a new dish on each visit.

Order hint: Each plate is made to your specification.  If you want ""more curry"", ""spicier"" or ""hotter"" you only need to ask. 

Desert Hint: The Coconut Ice Cream is made onsite: It is delicious and contagious.

Drink hints: A nice compliment to the food is a glass of Chardonnay or you can try the sweet Thai Iced Tea. 

It is very common for the Olashawn (owner and head chief) to leave the open kitchen to seat, greet, and serve her guests.  She is the heart of The Wild Thaiger.  As Marcial and I leave and thank her for another wonderful meal, her gracious smile, hands clasps and graceful bow, keeps us coming back.

Note:  METRO Lightrail construction has impacted this restaurant and you need to follow construction signs carefully to navigate the street and driveway to Wild Thaiger.  Drive slow, this Tiger is worth hunting in the concrete jungle."
1,"Possibly the worse service ever. I love their wings but for this simple experience, I will never go to Hooters again. Went there for the zombie walk and ordered wings and food. 
My party and I finished eating our food and the wings had not even come out. I had to ask for them twice and the last time I asked for them to go. I didn't even get to eat them at the restaurant. Worst of all no one apologized for the delay or for anything. Possibly the worse service ever. I will never ever go to a Hooters again. I can find better wings and service else where. So if you want to eat good wings and bad service then go for it. Should of been a zero star rating."
1,"DO NOT RENT HERE!!  I have had only issue after issue in the year I have been here.  I move out on Sunday.  Thank Goodness!!
I'm sitting here right now with no running water & as always the office is not returning my call.
Last week the AC was not working for almost 5 days.  My apt was 100 degrees.  
The office doesn't care & the maintenance crew is rude.
I've had consistent issues since move in with plumbing, AC and inconsiderate neighbors.
Stay far far away from this place!!!!!"
5,nice friendly knowledgable staff!!!! i left my wheels there and like an hour later they called and said they were ready. competitive pricing and he even took them to my car. i will definitely get my bike tires here next time too!!!! thanks guys.
1,"Scheduled appointment and repeated the date and time to confirm... The technician was a no show. So i called, and was told hat the appointment was for another day and time. Ok, a misunderstanding. They said someone would come out in 2 hours. In 3 hours I called and they said something else came up. I said, ""it's now or I am calling someone else"". The guy on the phone just said ""ok"".

These people are disorganized, do not respect your time, and clearly don't care about making customers happy.  Don't waste your time on these losers."
1,"This store needs to get with the 21st century. No online ability to take money. Won't take credit cards over the phone. Won't take American Express. Cutting themselves out of a big market.

For local purchases with better customer service and convenience I prefer Tempe Camera Repair. They at least choose to accomodate customers.

Don't know how this store stays in business."
5,"I went to this location tonight and ordered food. The guy who took my order got the order wrong. I told the shift manager, Matt, and he fixed the problem immediately. Furthermore, he was polite and had good manners which was a plus. Thank you, Matt!"
5,"In a pinch, I had to find a place for lunch that was downtown, not overly expensive, and served both delicious soup and salad. A coworker suggested the Coronado Cafe, so I looked up the menu and happily discovered that it more than met my criteria. 

For lunch, I had half of the Turkey sandwich and a small Coronado Gorgonzola salad. YUMMMM!!! The Turkey sandwich has a sort of cranberry relish instead of mayo (much healthier and much more delicious), and the Gorgonzola salad had apple slices and candied walnuts. It was the exact meal I was in the mood for. 

The restaurant itself is almost too cute for it's own good. It's small, cozy and the absolute polar opposite of any chain restaurant. The service was great, and my food arrived quickly. I can't wait to eat here again!"
5,"I love the Duck! Best quality sandwich in town! Yeah they are a little expensive, but if it's good, I don't mind spending the money. Who wants cheap crap? No thank you!

I swung by on my way home the other day to grab some lunch for the boyfriend and I and I was a little worried about the parking situation.... but I was pleasantly surprised that there was no issue. Lunch in downtown had just wrapped up as it was about 2pm so it was fairly quiet. Pulled into a metered spot, that even had 45 minutes left on it from the last person, THANK YOU!

I recommend either the turkey with provolone on a butter croissant OR the pastrami with swiss on sour dough. Make sure to grab some pickles when you check out, they are the best!"
1,"here's a tip - they don't stock their shelves, so what's on display they might not have, and they often have discontinued items on display. lame."
1,It is so unhealthy and gross! the chicken there isn't even real. YUCK!!!
5,"Good food, drinks are priced decently, super friendly staff.  We stop in at least once a week."
1,"Sadly nostalgia doesn't make the food here any less bland. I am very generous when I dine out, and always will find something positive to end the meal. In this case the positive was that I did not have to pay for the horrendous meal. 

Word to the wise- if a place that serves mexican food serves you ketchup as salsa, leave immediately. 

My boyfriend and I set the salsa aside and ordered the very basic machaca beef burritos. What we got was GRAY meat, with not one ounce of seasoning. 

At this point we apologized to our waiter, offered to pay for the drinks and salsa, but he seemed used to this and said not to worry about it. At first he tried to say they make the meat with eggs. But saw quickly that we would not be buying that story. We did leave a nice tip for the poor guy.

This is what happens when you have uninspired people making food. 

Too Sad."
1,"Worst customers service. In general, the stores never have stock on hand that is on sale. You'd think they would have stock on hand and more, esp if it is on sale but no and even the first day of ads, they don't have items.The shelf space is very limited.Again, if you advertise something on sale, have it on hand for the customers...
Don't waste your time with this store chain..Not worth it"""
5,"I agree with all these posts.  cheap, colorful, huge menu, good horchata, tres leches cake at the panaderia....

Not much more has to be emphasized, however, one reccommendation: get the ELOTE along with whatever you decide to get.  Its corn on a stick covered in mayo and queso- delicioso.  if you really want a treat, squirt ketchup all over it too.  mmmm market foooood"
1,"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and no one was at the front counter.  It's obvious that this is a small mom & pop type operation, which is encouraging because this usually means good food.  But we wouldn't know because no one ever came to the counter.  

There was one couple at a table eating, but no other customers at the time.  There was a dude walking around in the back, he looked right at us, but didn't acknowledge us in any way.  

We stood there for quite a while and looked over the menu repeatedly, hoping that at any moment someone might come forth and say something as simple as ""I'll be right with you"" etc.  Didn't happen.  

I get the whole idea of them not being fast food, and that good food takes time so on and so forth, but that shouldn't also mean ""we will not acknowledge your presence.  Ever.""  

Three more people came in behind us and proceeded to wait.  There were then five of us crowding around the counter................waiting...................and waiting...........

Here on Yelp I noticed that one complaint had a response from the business, which gives me some hope, but hey guys, I was there, with money in hand and you dropped the ball.........again apparently.  

We walked out after waiting a longgggggg time for nothing.   We may try again some day when we have absolutely nothing better to do.  However, if this is standard operating procedure I don't know that they'll still be around for that ""some day."""
1,"If you were to ask me about my in store purchase and customer service I would have said it was great. However that all changed once they had my money and the purchase was complete. I spent nearly $3,000 on a sectional over Memorial Day weekend and was told that my order would take at most 14 weeks but that most orders take around 6 weeks. So at the end of July I call and I'm told August 21st is my delivery date. I call back at the end of August (it took three messages and calls to reach my salesmen) and he says he's been trying to call me but my phone was broken (it wasn't, I've had the same phone for 10 years). Then he tells me it will be September 21st. I begrudgingly agree since this is the maximum timeline in the 14 weeks. Now here we are, its the end of September and I call again today and I'm told 2-4 more weeks. I tried to talk to the manager and express my dissatisfaction and he stood there silent on the other end of the phone offering no concern or effort to expedite my shipment.   Bottom line: once the sale is final and they have your money they put zero effort in helping you.   Meanwhile here I sit (on the floor) 4 months after my purchase and I still have another month to go (that is if this time quote is accurate)!  I recommend taking your business elsewhere. Somewhere where customer service is more than a smile to get the sale."
1,"Service: HORRIBLE. 
We had a reservation and they made us wait for 25 min. They did not have the courtesy of apologizing for making us wait. Trust me it was not a pleasure waiting with two kids. The owner was not at all friendly. 
Food: Good. 
But you will have to pay me to go back there. Never stepping in there again."
5,"Best place in the world, I cant endorse this shit enough. Best meal is as follows (although ive had other things here, all good, nothing touches this one)

App: Crawfish cheesecake, sounds weird but is best of Wisconsin and Louisiana at once. Cheese and crawfish. Done. 

Entree: Their special filet, basically take everything that is great and put it on a filet. Nothing more to say. Goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes makes this.

Desert: Chocolate creme brulee, exactly as it sounds, would choke a homeless person for this (wont be missed).

Live music also sometimes."
1,"I have been several times just because it is convenient. Last time, I had two shirts stolen out of my backseat. I went in and told the manager. He acted like I was making it up. I paid to have my car detailed and spent almost $80.00, and it looked like I got the basic wash. They didn't even get all of the tar (my main reason for detailing) off of the guards. I will never go back. I would rather do it myself than be so mad that I wasted the money everytime I go to Danny's. Ok, the owner must be a complete idiot. He will have the guys for immigration in soon asking for green cards. Talk about a ""run for the border"". Taco Bell."
1,"This was the best camera/photography store in the valley.  It has now been re-imagined and renamed as Photomart upon its move to Scottsdale.  I recently visited the new location...and I was shocked!  The store was extremely small, had very little to sell (I didn't even see a camera on display).  They did carry some glass...but mostly a very small selection of accessories.  I didn't even recognize any of the former employees.  

I encourage all the former loyal Photomark customers to visit Photomart.  I'm sure you will leave disappointed.  Two thumbs down to this lemon!"
5,"So I may be the only person in the world who is *not* a fan of Starbucks coffee (it's over-roasted and burned tasting to me)... which is why I'm so glad I found Java Detour - their coffee is smooth, the service is out-of-this-world, and the location is uber convenient, even during rush hour times.

Great coffee, great service, great prices - you can't go wrong.  Solid WIN.

I usually get an XL coffee with skim.  Cost: $2.10.  24 ounces of high quality coffee and you're good for the morning, afternoon, and/or evening.  I also enjoy stopping by on the way home from work and grabbing a decaf as a little ""nite cap.""  

Every server has been extremely friendly and helpful as well.  If you haven't checked these guys out, swing on through and treat yourself to a wonderful coffee experience."
5,"Now that I live next door, I've really come to appreciate this place. Want a pizza? They'll cook it to your exact specifications. Want a drink? Don and/or Ted will mix you up right. Prices are super reasonable. Crowd is always fantastic. Such a great neighborhood joint!"
1,"Just went in to look for a bike to ride to school, and work, and there were about 6 or 7 guys there doing nothing; didn't offer to help me, or asked if I had any questions about the bikes. They just completely and outright ignored me like I wasn't there. Don't suggest going there if you're a woman because a guy walked in behind me and he was helped right away. If I could give 0 stars I would."
5,"I must say, when moving to Phoenix a year ago, I was disappointed with the restaurants around the city.  I had tried all these places that were supposed to be just amazing but was always left wanting more.  The Coronado Cafe filled my expectations more than I had expected.  It was one of the first places I had heard about when I moved here a year ago, but never got around to trying it until recently.  I was pleasantly surprised with the food and thrilled with the atmosphere.  Little houses converted into restaurants have a certain charm about them that big corporate restaurants will never be able to create.  

The food was fresh and tasty but not overly fancy.  They offer a nice, inexpensive lunch menu and a more upscale dinner menu.  The service was unique meaning I did not feel like I had my own personal server slave for the time I was there.  I felt like he was somewhat stand offish, but we always had refills, etc. when we needed them.  In all honesty, it was nice to not be interrupted a million times by some disgruntled robot of a server who clearly hates their job.  So even though the service was not the typical upscale service, it was still good; it just had its own flavor."
1,"Eeeeee. Long yet important message to follow!!

If I was blind and If this place gave me the ability to see again.... Eeeeeehhhh I still wouldn't go back.

The first time I went, a few years back it was good. Good food! Then got take out and yeah, just well cooked good food. Nothing to write home about but still good. 

This time... Wild tiger turned into wild sloth. Arguably just as cool in animal comparison but the tiger could, if he so chose to, rip apart the sloth with vigor. 

The hostess was hard to find and inattentive. Se really wasn't present or rememberable. We sat down and ordered. Waters came out. Then our app. It was some roll thingy. It tasted like frozen shrimp wrapped in rice paper for 9 bux. Oh oh oh it tasted like the rolls you get at the sushi place in Safeway. Yea no thanks. Plus the waiter seemed to disappear. A while later the food was delivered. Hhmm. Pad Thai you say? Uh nope! Well if you call over cooked noodles shoved under a huge pile of cabbage pad Thai the yeaaa.. I guess. 
Curry you say.... Hmmm nope just over spiced over cooked and tasteless except for the over spice thing.., which is just down right confusing. 

The waiter never came back to check on us. My lady dropped her eating utensil on the ground and I went inside to get another. Standing at the empty hostess station looking around....looking....still looking....oh oh hey  hostess can I have a.. She cuts me off. ""I'll be back"" denied!!!! By the drive by host from a terminator movie. 
Well waiting still. Find someone. Utensils. Cool. Thanks. Sorry to be a bother as a paying customer.   
Then I sit back down. Take a few bites and realize everything tastes the same. Cold, over cooked and over spiced. 
So in effort to try to salvage this meal I try to ask for some limes. Guess what... Shocker..... It took me getting up to find someone. Cool got em. Cool, great, not real limes. Just little ones, like the ones you use for Mexican food!! Wtf!!! 

Anyways. Forcing it down cuz I'm sick of the search party of two game that they have thrust upon us, the waiter still never came back. The lady bussing the tables cleared our stuff except for the untouched pad Thai. We actually tipped the bus lady she was nice and a very hard worker.

Still
Wait
Ing

Oh wait I forgot the rules of the game.... I got up to search for the check. Yeaaaa! At what point do I win? And really what could the prize be?   Oh nothing. I guess you could say I win by not ever having to go back there. 

Sad really. Was a good place. I understand running a place like this has challenges but no care was shown from beginning to end about the customer experience. Oh well except for the bus lady she was cool.... Maybe she should own the place? Winning! 

And I'm out!"
1,"I suddenly knew this was a mistake as soon as we started to scale the steep difficult steps and the handrail covered with a large amount of bird POOP. My stomach turned and I couldn't imagine why they don't have somebody to clean the handrail.

We were a few minutes early for our reservation so we walked around a bit. It is an interesting OLD House with narrow hallways and a small room with an old fashioned operators switchboard. It does have beautiful views. The house has a beautiful entrance door and interesting intricate ceilings but over all it really isn't so grand with old worn carpet and common tiles. I thought I'd see a bunch of marble or granite but I didn't.

We thought this was an interesting Choice for restaurant week because we wanted to see this place. Also this was one of the few places that gave you three courses without dessert. Also the $10 non member fee was waived for restaurant week.

I can't say the food was completely awful but I wouldn't come back for it either even for free so I think that qualifies for the one star rating.

We asked about cocktails and our waiter said they were the last page of the wine menu but they weren't and only lasted the liquors. He returned and my husband asked for the cocktail menu we saw outside and the waiter brings us the cocktail menu. I decided on a drink but the waiter didn't return for a long period of time so we decided to just order dinner and skip the cocktails.

Our waiter said the Sous Vide Chicken was stuffed with something green and he didn't know what it was but to him it was very salty. He also said the Carpaccio wasn't very good. So we decided to go with the other two starters.

The starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again. A not so great crab cake sitting on creamy peas with two refrigerated cold roasted tomatoes. The other was a few slices of eggplant with a little cheese.

The middle plates were not so seasoned escargots with a forgettable salad. The highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese. The other middle plate was not hot and not cold but unhealthy room temperature tomato soup with a over whipped cream laced with truffle aroma. (Aroma means perfume) (and over whipped means turned to butter). We both thought the tomato soup was the best of what we tried here. It tasted like good tomatoes that would be great on a pizza.

For dinner we tried the duck and the bronzini. Both were cooked just OK but neither seemed to have good seasoning or flavor however both of our vegetables were salted too heavy. I'd say so heavy I could tell what kind of salt they used and it wasn't good salt. The one thing that I could honestly say WAS terrible was the artichoke , anise sabayon. I tasted it and nearly barffed. I am without words to describe how it tasted but the texture was like hummus. Both plates had what they called polenta towers. They looked (see photo) happy to see us and I thought mine might squirt something when I went to eat it. But I was baffled when I tasted it because it wasn't like polenta. It was like corn muffin mix that was mixed with a farina kind of cereal. It was bready and lacked much of the corn taste and really tasted like cream of wheat cereal.

I can almost say forgettable but I can't because I will never forget the bird poop or the polenta tower.

1.5 stars almost 2 stars but with price factored in I feel one star

SLIGHT UPDATE 9-11-13
I read that they got a new chef since my review so hopefully they are better now."
5,I have been back a couple of times since my first review.  The yogurt is delicious and they offer a wide variety of flavors and toppings.  The service is very personable and friendly.  This is a downtown gem.
1,"Really LGO?! I quit going to my neighborhood spot because of all the ""affliction wearing douche's"" that have over run every area of my neighborhood. A friend invited yesterday for lunch,so we jammed on our cruisers..well, you know the parking and it was a beautiful day yesterday. I was so craving the tuna melt sandwich have been salivating about it for months..months I tell you. I order from a chipper little gal...I asked if I could have it open faced. She didn't think it would be a problem...wrong answer! The kitchen obviously has never made an open faced before..oh yes they have and use to get it right..guess the new peeps from down south didn't get the how to memo. 
The 1st time it came out with two slices of bread with a square of slightly melted cheddar laying there flat with a huge dollop of cold tuna on top...Really?? I took it back..a different girl said what's wrong with that? Apparently everything you nit wit! So, they remade it, check my photo..this is what I got back..except I added the zig zag of color just so I could choke it down. The ""manager type"" person actually handed this to me and said, ""your remake"" Really? But I was so hungry and frustrated, I took it..not even any fruit..so for $7.50 I got a plate of tuna poop. 3 bites later, it hit the trash receptacle. Don't ever expect anyone there to step up to the plate and offer you a refund or a do over..cuz it just ain't happening right. I was here a couple of months ago, ordered potato leek soup, came out curdled and cold..an employee walking by my table said, ""wow that doesn't look right, gross"" wouldn't take it off the bill and was like, ""glad I'm not eating it"". And I'm glad I'm not eating here anymore and that Bertha's and Acacia Cafe have moved into the neighborhood. The people watching may not be the same, but the food is great, service outstanding and even better prices. What a shame!"
1,"I have never written a review before but felt I needed to after my experience with Croque. We order from Croque all the time and most often have the food delivered.  In the past the food would arrive around 20 minutes later than we were told but it wasn't a big deal.  

Today when we ordered we were told our food would be delivered in 30 minutes.  An hour later still no food.  My boyfriend called and the lady told him the food was on the way without even saying sorry or anything.  Another hour went by now we had been waiting 2 hours for our 30 minute delivery.  He called back and told the lady we still had not received our order.  She said it's on its way again.  He told her I hope you are not planning on charging us for this food because we have been waiting 2 hours.  In a pissed off voice she says ""Oh so you want a free meal???""  After some arguing she said she would not charge for the food.  

Twenty minutes later I received a call from the drive.  She told me her boss said not to charge for the food but demanded... ""you have to tip the driver"" over and over again.  I told her she could talk to my boyfriend when she got here.  She then called back three more times yelling that we had to tip her.  My boyfriend told her just so you know I was going to tip you but when you deliver food 2 hours late you shouldn't call your customers and demand that they tip you.  Tipping is optional and it's based on performance.  When she got here she rang the doorbell 8 times in a row (No i'm not making this up) 

Needless to say at this point we did not tip her and will no longer be ordering from Croque.  Their customer service is a Croque of $#!%.  (Sorry I had to!!!!)"
1,"So theres a lot I'd like to cover or warn people about so I'll keep the keep points separated by paragraphs. 

So we've lived here for the better part of a year now and since day one we have seen these little yellow roaches everywhere that seemed to come out at night, they were EVERYWHERE! We don't have much food in the house and its all kept in the fridge to keep it from all the bugs. They come from the unsealed cabinets and every drain in the house. I even see them in the dishwasher climbing all over the dishes all the time. Dishes pulled from the cabinets often had bug crap on them. I don't know how many times I woken up to bugs crawling around, flicked them off my newborn son or woken up to them in my shirt.  We literally kill anywhere from 15-40 roaches in a single night every single night. When we go to the office they always off put it onto other people and though we see the spray truck here regularly but never visiting out unit, only those near the office.The last 5 months or so seem to have brought some new beetle things to the apartment. Twice I've moved stacks of papers for work and tons of baby beetles fleeing from them. And for the record we are immaculate in our place. Theres never a mess or uncleaned surface. 

The grounds are very poorly kept in places beyond the front office area. The gates here have worked for more than a week at most at one time. They actually haven't closed in months, last time they were fixed it was for just part of the day.  The garbage piles up around all the garbage cans for days. You will find bags lying everywhere including taking up car spaces which are not always easy to come by. 

The water in the apartments get turned off randomly without any warning. Its happened a few times during our stay here but the last time the grounds were flooded so I could see it wasn't planned. 

The air conditioning unit in here drips a lot and my family and I have had bad respiratory issues the last 6 months and come to find out the AC was pumping out mold spores that we were breathing for months. The thing hadn't even had the air filter in it all this time either. All those times we thought it was severe allergies or that we stayed awake all night coughing was poor building maintenance. My infant son often gets fevers of up to 104 that seem to spike when all of our symptoms get going. Needless to say we are breaking our lease and moving. I will not pay a company to let me rent a bug infested mold box that jeopardizes the health of my family. 

Your neighbors will break the rules in the lease agreement at every turn. They invite parties of several people to the pool and blast music all day (and night) long. Screaming kids at the pool after midnight got old real quick. I very regularly see children under the age of I'm guessing 12 at the pool unsupervised with no adults to be found."
5,"One of my favorite dining experiences in the Madison area. The underground atmosphere at Louisianne's is quaint yet not unsophisticated; we went on the eve of a snowstorm, so the pianist didn't make it in to play--though I'm sure he would have made a nice dinnertime addition.

Service was friendly and efficient. Our lemon artichoke appetizer was excellent--akin to bruschetta, but minus the tomatoes and plus pine nuts and a decadent lemon-y parmesan topping. For an entree, I ordered the blackened catfish with spinach mashed potatoes, and wasn't disappointed... though I will say my fish was seasoned on the heavy side. I didn't mind the additional kick, but you may want to let the staff know if you don't like the sensation of blackened fire-breathing between bites.

I was also pleased with the wine selection. And really, how can you go wrong with the chocolate creme brulee for dessert? Thanks, Louisianne's, for a warm, inviting dinner--and for heating me up with enough cajun spice to temporarily make me forget how blustery it is outdoors!"
1,"Needed a cheap hotel after our flights got cancelled due to bad weather. We were laying on the bed with clothes on (luckily!) for ~2 hrs when some kind of beetle ran across the sheets. Went to the front desk and the man there didn't seem surprised, just gave us another key card for a different room.... we checked that out, and while it didn't have a bullet hole in the bathroom window like our previous room, we still asked for a refund.

The ""24-hour shuttle"" that picked us up was someone's personal van that they used to drive travelers to the airport.... or drop off prostitutes as the driver was doing when we walked outside. to put our luggage in the van.

The strip club across the street is pretty dismal looking, too."
1,"IF YOU LIKE TO OVERPAY FOR WATERED DOWN COFFEE, SERVICE WITH AN ATTITUDE, & GET STALE PASTRY WITH FLIES FLYING INSIDE THE BAKERY CASE THAN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! BTW: THERE IS A 50 CENT CHARGE TO USE YOUR CREDIT/DEBIT CARD TO PAY FOR YOUR COFFEE HERE (WTF!)
 
I hate to write a negative review for a place that use to be an old neighborhood favorite.  But if your loyal customers just stop showing up & never criticize your performance you can 't FIX IT! 

So here's my father's words of wisdom that you won't get in any business school: 
""People go where they are invited, they stay where they feel welcomed!""

Hava java stopped inviting & welcoming customers when it started putting offensive signs on the bathroom door, and then password protecting its free WiFi service with passwords like BUY COFFEE! It seems that Hava Java lost the hunger to be a superior establishment by having better tasting products at a competitive price, and giving their customers a better experience than their competitors!

Hava Java  use to be a great place to hang out or for a cup of coffee in the Arcadia/Camelback area, but it seems in the past couple of years the place has consistently slipped and it is sharing the faith of another once upon a time great coffee hang out at the Biltmore area, The Coffee Plantation!"
5,Some of the best pizza in town. Fresh ingredients in both the pizza and the pasta.  I've tried different menu items and you can't go wrong with anything you order. The place is very clean and nicely decorated.  Fast service and friendly staff.
5,Great place to stop in and eat. Very casual and relaxed and I think you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The Phil Mickelson sandwich was great.
5,"I was super nervous about using these guys due to the poor reviews, but I have a home warranty and the company chooses who we work with- I didn't have a choice.  I was pleasantly surprised.  We actually had to cancel our first appointment because we were having some major electrical work done that morning and the power was shut off at the time the appointment was supposed to be.  THEY actually called us a little later in the afternoon to find out how things were going and asked when they could send someone out.  They came out on time and got right to work.  The technician was nice and knowledgeable and explained to me that our A/C was shot (bad compressor and burned out wires- we were worried this might be the case after he said it was almost 20 years old).  I was glad to hear he knew about the warranty process and explained how that would all work too.  

So far, so good.  I'll be sure to update my review when they actually repair or replace the A/C (it's pending approval from the warranty company at the moment)."
1,"This place is still as bad as it was when I first reviewed it.  I got suckered into giving it another go because I didn't want to eat alone, and there were literally no redeeming qualities.  

For those reviewers who think reviews like mine are BBQ snobbery, I'd say even when I'm starving and don't give a rip I'd rather have ANY other BBQ in Phoenix than this place."
5,"Once in a while you run into a shop that really does things well and, when that happens to me, I like to give them a shout-out. Today it was Heel and Sole a shoe repair place on Sherman (in Madison). I thought I was going to be dropping off my leather coat to get the zipper replaced. Instead he asked a few questions and said, ""Let's try a smaller repair first."" He took my coat to the back and two minutes later had repaired it. When I tried to pay him, he laughed and said, ""No. No charge. Go away, now."" (In a very funny way -- not at all rude.) Day = made."
1,"Their delivery service was disappointing.  I was told 45min to an hour for delivery. At about 45 minutes the driver shows up with the wrong pizza.  He calls in and they tell him that it's in the oven, so he tells me he'll be right back. 45 minutes later he shows up with a cold pizza. This ruined the dinner experience.  I couldn't tell you if their pizza is good because I am not a fan of room temperature pizza. As a consolation the bum driver gave me some coupons (thanks!)."
1,"The only reason that I'm giving this place even one star is that they show UFC pay-per-view with no cover. 

I've been here with friends about three times now, two of them to watch a fight, the other time because it was the only place within walking distance that had food.  All three times our waitress was rude and largely absent.  I'll add that we are really not into the whole TnA aspect of this restaurant, and treat our waitress like any other waitress.  No ogling, no rude comments, none of that immature bullshit.

We went here last night from 7pm until a little after 10pm, and didn't get a refill on water until just before we left, even though I'd downed the first cup within ten minutes of arriving and also ordered ""hot"" wings (the Daytona, which is hot sauce and bbq sauce mixed together, I guess.  Not hot at all).  The wings are tiny and completely overcooked.  I do not recommend these at all.

Friend #1 ordered the boneless wings, which are a joke.  I ordered them last time and assumed it was just a fluke when they brought out a plate of ten tiny (smaller than Chicken McNuggets) hardened pieces of overcooked chicken.  I'm not the type to send things back at restaurants, so I just tried to pretend that I was eating some sort of food, and not little pieces of rubber.  However, Friend #1 received the same thing this time.  Tiny pieces of very chewy....chicken?  Maybe.  I do not recommend these at all.

Friend #2 ordered a dozen hot wings.  Took just shy of an hour for them to arrive.  The waitress would pop up every fifteen minutes or so, and say something like, ""Oh my gosh, they haven't brought those yet?""  When they did come out, they were tiny and overcooked, and also quite cold.  I do not recommend these at all.

Overall, the worst restaurant in Phoenix, I think.  If they didn't offer the fight with no cover, they'd have literally no redeeming value.  I'm just going to Buffalo Wild Wings next time (they have a $5 cover and a drink minimum, but it has to be worth it).  This place needs to close down for a few months and reevaluate, or just go away entirely, like every other business in the AZ Center.

Oh, PS, they have never brought out our correct bill.  Always has a bunch of random crap that no one ordered on it, and the girls act all put out when we point out that no one ordered half of the bill that they're trying to charge us for.  Keep an eye out on that receipt."
5,"One of my all time favorite places in Madison;  I like it so much that I had them cater my wedding.  I have been eating at NOTO for at least 20 years, and the food is consistently good.  I always have a hard time deciding what to get... the shrimp etouffee?  A shrimp po' boy with Creole sauce?  Or one of the daily specials like the pecan fish or the Cajun meatballs?  The cornbread is also worth noting for its yumminess."
1,"Worst service I have ever had at a pharmacy.  Every time I went to pick up a prescription it was not ready, even if I gave them 48 hrs to fill the script from the time of my Dr. calling it in.  I try to give people the benefit of the doubt most of the time, but the employees are very rude and act like they are doing you a huge favor by even acknowledging you.  The last time I went my script was not ready yet again and I didn't have time to wait because I was on my lunch.  The woman stated she would call me when it was ready.  When she did, I told her about my complaints, she asked me to hold for a manager.  After 25 minutes of holding I told her I could not wait any longer.  I decided it was not worth my time or energy as they seemed they could not care less about their customers.  I will never go back"
1,"Customer service inside was decent...the people outside though weren't as nice. After my car was washed, they let it roll in neutral nearly hitting a wall. Guess they didn't realize it's a manual transmission. So after some guy jumping in and slamming on the brakes, he took it to start drying it off. As he was driving it to the drying area, he started driving it hard.  After drying it off, another guy got in to park it. He was driving my car hard like a race car...just like the young man before him. I told him that I'd appreciate it if he didn't drive my car or any other customer's cars like that. He looked at me with a smirk and pretended like he didn't speak English. They obviously have no respect for other people's personal vehicles or opinions."
1,"Zoe's is probably not a place to go if you are a Vegan. Actually, it's probably not a place to go if you are a T-rex either. When it comes down to it, this chain is no better than Chik-fil-a in what it offers. At least with Chik-Fil-A I get my food quickly and a nice side of cross-cut fries.

Zoe's Kitchen sits across the street from My Florist which, when you really think about it, was a dumb move on corporate's part. Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.

The food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator. The least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit.

There's another one of these over on Camelback, it may or may not be better, but as far as our downtown one goes, this place will never see me or my money again."
1,"About two months ago I needed to get waxed, and I would normally head to the Brow Lady but thought I'd give the Spa a chance, since I'm there daily already. I called in advance for an appointment. I went in and was led to the Relaxation Room by the very friendly Spa receptionist. I had arrived ten minutes early for the appointment, hoping she could take me sooner and I could be on my way sooner. There was not one other person in the Relaxation Room with me. There also isn't a wall clock and I soon found out why. 

My extra ten minutes pass. No waxer approaches me. Another ten minutes go by and I'm sitting there twiddling my thumbs wondering what is going on. I decide to go up front and see what the deal is. The receptionist says she will find out and I tell her I have places to go and can't wait much longer. I go back to the relaxation room...which is now not at all relaxing. Five more minutes pass....the receptionist comes to say she's sorry and the waxer will be right with me. It was at least another five, maybe even ten, and I was boiling mad. The waxer finally strolled in and of course the waxing itself took a whopping 2 minutes.  Sure she was nice enough but she was almost half an hour late for my appointment. The receptionist didn't think it was worth comping me the $13.50 cost so the waxer received no tip. 

The second time I used the Spa was when I injured my back in one of the classes and had to run, crying, out of the class. There is no Sports Medicine person on staff as far as I was aware so I hobbled to the Spa and found the receptionist in the back of the salon. I begged for a massage therapist to help me and she told me no one was there and massages didn't start until 9AM. This, by the way was at about 8:10AM. I'm standing in front of this woman, having trouble breathing and crying uncontrollably and she's telling me to wait an hour? Finally she figured out I was NOT kidding and said she'd call around to see who could come in ASAP. She helped me into a chair in the very UN-relaxing room and I wept alone there for about 15 minutes. She happened by the door again after that and said that a masseuse would be there in 15-20 minutes. I had no cell phone, watch or wall clock to measure that time, nor was any other help offered so I just continued weeping. It was 8:30AM (I'm guessing) when another spa-goer arrived for her day of treatments and went into the locker room to change. I managed to get in there as well (after a bit) and ask her if she knew the time. 8:45AM. 

Obviously my massage therapist didn't show up until 9AM. That would be too bloody much to ask when one has a crippling back injury. Sure the massage was decent (not in price mind you). I just feel like my time and money are completely unappreciated and I absolutely will not return there. By the way, the showers in the spa area are TERRIBLE. The ones in the locker room are much better and on the whole the bathroom/locker room in the spa is a waste of space."
5,Been here 4 times in the past 6 months.  I love bringing out-of-towners here.  Excellent art and history exhibits specifically related to Native Americans from the southwestern United States.  Reasonably priced entrance fee.  Go on the tour - they will tell you really interesting things about each of the exhibits you otherwise wouldn't know - makes the visit much more enjoyable.  A must see for visitors to Phoenix!
1,"Safeway grocery you suck. First we had to get the stupid shoppers card now this horrible Safeway phone APP. Are you kidding me? It is easier to log into my bank account than your ridiculous phone coupon app account at Safeway. 
First problem...The shopper card, the app and Safeway.com don't communicate with each other and the phone ""help-line"" is patronizing and arrogant. Do I really need 3 accounts just to shop? I don't think so!
Next, the twit in the produce department at the Indian School store had evidently gone to the same customer service training as the phone call center because she kept telling me to get help with ""one of our App specialists"" at the front desk. News Flash for Safeway... If it takes an App specialist the software IS NOT READY for prime time. And I wanted lettuce for heaven's sake. I did not want a technology lesson from a grocery store clerk!!!!
Furthermore, it takes a Captain Mid-Night decoder to figure out if the ""savings"" are for members translate as, the stupid card... OR the APP only specials or just normal in-store savings. UGH. I don't need grocery shopping to be this complicated. I put my lettuce back on top of a case of cokes and walked out!!
Safeway, you should stick with groceries and leave the internet experience and downloadable apps to someone that can develop them. I'll buy more and more from Amazon rather than this stupid place. If I wanted to shop with my phone, I'd already be going to Amazon at least they understand how to make customers happy. When I go into a bricks and mortar store, I just want to see the stuff and buy it. I don't want to have to drag a computer (phone) app with me! 
I'm so angry at Safeway that I'll be buying from Target."
5,"First rate bar food, better than many restaurants and priced right. You cant go wrong. Under new ownership but this hasn't affected quality. Great blues bar too."
1,"What a disappointment. We began our late night (9:30) dinning experience here really happy with high expectations as the ambiance was wonderful and the recommendations were good. However, we left bitter and disappointed. My sister and I enjoyed two lovely ""small plates"" one was beef skewers and the other a shrimp bruschetta type dish. It was all down hill after that. Shortly after ordering our main courses we noticed a bug crawling on the top of our booth...yeah, it was a COCKROACH!!! I grabbed it in my napkin and crumpled it up and left in a side station area. We both were grossed out but were not going to make a huge fuss and have it ruin our meal. We're both flexible and understanding and didn't complain. But seeing that in a restaurant is really inexcusable and disgusting-and definitely dampers your appetite for their food. Where are his friends? Are they in the kitchen?! YUCK!!! We then waited 45 minutes for our food: an enchilada plate and a relleno plate. When they set down the steaming hot plates the food was cooked to nuclear levels because there  was a one inch crust around the plate and the beans were so dried out it was comical. Now mind you, these are $16 and $18 dollar plates of food. That is borderline fine dinning pricing and should come out looking as such. We promptly sent the food back and the manager came out and apologized which was appreciated. He stated that ""it was inexcusable the way the food came out (which our server didn't monitor) and that his cook is obviously more interested in cleaning and getting out of here, then preparing the food."" They offered to remake the food but it was literally too late around 10:45 and we didn't want to wait. They then took the food off but left the other stuff on. The bill came out to around 42 dollars. Which seemed unreasonable after only having a beer, a cocktail, two appetizers and a totally ruined dinning experience. We didn't mention the cockroach or the fact that it was my 30th birthday to the manager but it boils down to this: after that kind of experience he could of saved our business by comping the meal. The fact that we had TWO ruined entrees and walked out of their still hungry AND paying 40 dollars is bullshit. There are too many other quality options in this town with exceptional service. I wont ever go back to Rokerij."
1,"Danny's Car Wash has become synonymous for me with the words ""HELL NO!""

Danny's was a 5 star Car Wash 15 years ago! 
This place use to really have the WOW FACTOR!
I liked it so much I had my vehicle dolled up here as if it came out of the factory show room several times a week... Going to Danny's was a Friday ritual before going out on the town! With the friendliest customer service & a Job #1 attitude, I use to think how I can motivate people like this! I even went to different locations, because I thought maybe the people @ the highland location think I'm a repeat customer & are going the extra mile to keep me coming back!

Danny's Family Carousel Car Wash is now all about the Up-sell! No Danny's Family Carousel Car Wash is now all about the Pressure Up-sell! 
I understand this is a business & there is a bottom line, but to pressure your customers to purchase more than they intend is not up-selling, it is unscrupulous!
They hit you full force the second you pull into the station! Instead of earning repeat business like they use to they are trying to up-sell you get the works, an oil change and windshield damage repair, and everything else they have to sell! When you decline all the extras they disappear as quickly as they showed up & everywhere else you get nothing but bad attitudes!  They try to rush you out of there as quickly as possible, to the point that they always miss something... I've left there several times in a rush to find the front end of my car still covered with bug marks!

In the past several years I've had countless bad experiences. 
So bad that I go out of my way not to use a Danny's Family Car Wash!"
5,"Great cousins!  The subs are always good and they have a grill!  If you want Cousins, GO TO THIS ONE!"
5,"I love the AZ Science Center. My son and I have been coming here for the last 7 years and we love it each time we are here. The center has their permanent exhibits but they always have something new and fun thru out the year so regardless of how many times you go, there is always something new for your little one to explore. It's easy to spend a whole day there starting early in the morning. It's impossible to condense 7 years of experience into one short review except to write that this place is worth coming to, for locals and out of towners alike if I've been able to bring my son here for 7 years and have been consistently happy with the center. And I look forward to bringing him here for many more years to come!"
1,"A far cry from the South Scottsdale location. The wings I ordered were ice cold! when I brought them back to the counter, the lady said nothing and threw them into a microwave. I kid you not! If you want good wings, try another location. PROS : I didn't get e-coli."
5,"Monty's is awesome.  Their vegetarian comfort food is great and there are lots of choices.  Get the spicy waffle fries with your sandwich; they are not actually spicy, but they're delicious.  I also love the milkshakes!"
1,"Fast good quality ingredients with restaurant prices. Typical selection of beers and drinks. The food here deserves a no stars but the the atmosphere is deserving of the star.
 
I order the Cuban Sandwich which came with a choice of two sides. I choose the fries and the Nightmare Chili. The sandwich was definitely not what I was expecting... I almost want to say they have me the wrong food, but I am not willing to go back to check it out.

The sandwich was much more like a grilled chicken sandwich with poor quality lettuce and tomato. It was  an extremely disappointing dining experience. The sides weren't bad but were also very small portions.  The beer was served in a plastic cup which is not ideal for any situation that isn't poolside.

The atmosphere was the most interesting part of coming here. It is a shame that Alice Cooper would let his restaurant stoop this low. This is definitely a busy model focused around profits and not quality or satisfaction. This restaurant would never survive without its namesake."
1,"Dirty and filthy, food is awful, place filled with bugs and roaches.  I do not care how long they have been around, they are not jewish cooks or food preps, the MATZO BALL SOUP you could hit someone with.. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE."
5,"Decided to try this place out after reading the review here. My Wife and I are glad we did. 

This place was sooo good. A true diamond in the rough. 

The food was perfect. My Wife had the welcome burger and fries. It came out cook exactly the way she asked. I tried the big jim and the cannibal fries. I was only able to eat mine with a fork and knife. It hit the spot. The fires we excellent!!. 

We each had a drink with our meal, they did not disappoint either. 

I would eat here all the time if I lived closer, so maybe that is a good thing. I would weight about 500lbs. 

If you are even remotely close, check this place out!!!"
1,Customer service here is terrible.  Guy working there wouldn't accept my tv even though it was under warranty.  Finally had to call a manager at a DIFFERENT Best Buy location (Scottsdale) where they told me they would gladly fix my tv for free.  Not worth the hassle to go here.
1,"So, I ate there on Wednesday and it is now Friday.  I have not had solid food or been able to keep anything down since I went there.  In an area that has so many great places don't go there.  Keep driving east on Camelback and hit one of the many other restaurants on that street."
5,Always consistently delicious! Classic preparations of Americanized Chinese. The cashew chicken is great!
1,"On name alone, we HAD to check this place out, just for kicks.

Ouch!

Bandaids indeed; this place hurts and not in a good way. And you might want to spritz that with some iodine for good measure.

I've got no qualms with talent, don't get me wrong. The female form is a beautiful thing to behold in all of its varied curve-tastic shape and form. A woman is a woman is a beautiful woman, and I'm a sucker. By default, naked womanhood warrants an automatic 3-star baseline from me, but the slummy and desperate atmosphere in this dive is a soulsuck for all that dare enter.

The squat brick building sits all by its lonesome under that tacky illuminated ""Bandaids Show Lounge"" sign, the surrounding parking lot emanating with ""Damn, I'mma get mugged out here"" uncertainty and darkness.

Once inside (yes, you go in through the sketchy looking front door that looks as welcoming as the sketchy looking service door), you're met by security and carded; the girls headed for the bar, another friend and myself were subjected to a [sub-standard*] pat downs - *sub-standard, the folding knife clipped and visible in my front pocket (CA law) went unnoticed.  A printed ""no sideways caps, no baggy/saggy jeans, no long tees"" dress code tacked by the door. Classy!

After getting a few beers from the pretty bartender (she was actually really really good-looking, hottest girl on staff, setting a false precedent for what the talent would look like), we made our way past shady regulars at the bar with their necks crook'd to the lounge, finding a couple of tables near, but not next, to the center stage.

Most of us sat talking and laughing with each other, occasionally glancing at the stage just to see what's up, and watching the depraved humanity of the other patrons in the place, empty on a Friday night...
... the out-of-towner business man in the dark corner, getting dances from any girl that would come his way.
... the mouth-breather waiting with stalker-ish anticipation for a dance with one of the, er, amply-bossomed strippers.
... the table of youngins, dressed exactly how the posted dress code prohibited.

Girl after girl (a couple+ of ""a'ight"" girls, most ""everyday"" girls, and at least one ""is that a girl?"") came to the stage, gyrated to cliche strip club music, some exhibiting gymnast caliber pole skills and limberness, then cruised the showroom floor, peddling their wares with a repeated-to-monotone-perfection ""Would you like a dance?  Would you like a dance?"".

None of us partook in the festivities, but two friends in an adjoining party did.  One, quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it.  The other, a recent migrant from war-torn and fundamentalist Afghanistan, got one of the [few] Barbies who would keep him entranced and occupied for 4-5 songs... and about $100.

After a quick 30 minutes, we'd thought we'd seen the whole rotation of ""meh"" talent and skeevy behavior.  And that's when we saw it...
...the epitome of tacky divey strip club attire...
...the summation of the Bandaids experience...
...that's when we saw it... 

...The HOOD-KINI*!

It was time to leave... quickly. As we braved the parking lot,  it was joke after FirstAid and Infectious disease related joke. Automatic hilarity at the mere mention during the rest of our trip.

1,"It's my own fault for coming back to this raper. 

Typical story, went in for an oil change/car wash after recently having my car at a mechanics who assured me all my fluids were good. I could barely understand the mumbler that told me I needed brake fluid, transmission fluid, air filter, and some other filter. No thanks. Just the oil.

He came back with a bill for $98?? He charged me for gas. I didn't get gas. It took 20 minutes to get it sorted out. I was there almost two hours. Car wasn't clean. (Do they really vacuum?!!!)

Will I ever learn?"
5,They pay high attention to detail which comes across in the quality of their work. If you want a job well done do not rush them.
1,"These girls that work there are so bitchy. They were so mean to my son. So unwelcoming! I will never ever bring my family there again! I thought they can manage a trim, a fade. It's not some high fashion salon! It's a cheap hair cut place! These girls need to go back to Cosmotology!"
5,I love being in downtown Phoenix and this was a perfect lunch spot ! I love their other location as well on Camelback.  I'm always happy with their fresh food and great service - another must go if you haven't yet !
1,"AWFUL experience today...long story short, I am looking for a new dentist. I love our old one, but he's a little far from our house...so, I started by getting recommendations from my area parenting board (the best board EVER). From there I narrowed it down to 3 offices and despite my broken arm, took Truman in his Service Dog vest off to check them out in person. I had a fairly dreadful experience at Dr. Michael Zacher's office. For those of you that don't know, I am a disabled person with a service dog. He is a hypoallergenic poodle and extremely well behaved. I was instructed by Dr. Zacher's Office Manager Rhonda that my dog was not welcome in their office (which by the way is beautiful with tv's, comfy leather sofas and a children's play room). I explained to her that under federal law, a Service Animal cannot be denied access to a facility. And, that I have NEVER in all my time with him (going on 3 years) been asked to leave. I can assure you that I am a very pleasant, nice (even fun) person. Truman was nestled near my feet having a snooze while this happened. He was not in any way disruptive. She told me that she would ask Dr. Zacher. About 15 minutes later Rhonda called back and told me the 'there was not a good fit', and that I could not use Dr. Zacher for my dental needs. I am very upset at being treated in this manner. After all if I had come in with a cane, would I have been denied access? The only recourse I have is to report back to you here and ask you to consider this when making your choices."
5,"Now, this one doesn't really fit into any category, because it is a nonprofit org, but I really felt compelled to put a review in for it to help get the word out.  This is such a great way to volunteer your time, and they are always in need of Bigs, especially men.  The boys waiting for a Big sometimes have to wait for a year just to get one, and with some of these children, they need someone now.

If you have a few extra hours a month, a tiny bit of your time can help do wonders for a child.  I have been a Big since February, and it is such a rewarding experience.  For privacy issues, I won't go into the details of my Little, but she is a really great girl.  She gets excited every time we talk and she makes as much of a difference in my life as I do hers.

Some of the things we have done together:
mini golf
Dave and Busters
movies (lots)
Ceramic painting at As You Wish
Children's Literacy Luncheon - AZ Kidney Foundation

And we've also just hung out at my house and talked.  

There are so many kids out there who just need someone to talk to, and to show them that they are special and important.  If you have the time and energy, I don't think that there is a better place that you could spend it."
1,"I would giver this place a negative rating if I could. I was having some brake trouble last week. When I would depress my pedal, it would go to the floor and glide to a stop, without locking the wheels. I was told to go to just brakes. I went and immediately they tried selling me extras that I didn't ask for. I ended up paying 300 dollars fr new pads, shoes, calipers, and a fluid flush. You'd think,"" oh my car would work after that much"",. They even have someone who test drives it before you take it, but low and behold my brakes were EXACTLY the same. I went back the next day and had to argue with these dolts over why my brakes aren't different and why if I'm paying 300 dollars it should be. I finally got them to cover the labor the piece they thought to be the issue. The main cylinder apparently needed to be replaced, but god forbid they check that with everything else in the first place. Now I'm waiting for a part to arrive that I had to pay for just so I can use my car. Further the second time I brought the car in and dropped it off so the could look at it, the BROKE MY IPOD. The buttons were off of it. I immediately complained about it and they tried to blame the sun and continues that ""no one had driven the car"". I replied, ""then how did it get in your garage dip shit?"". No one apologized still for it. It this doesn't deter you from here I don't know what will."
1,"this bank is terrible and will charge you unfounded fees. it is a hassle to try and communicate with this bank and their customer service is terrible, i would not recommend this bank unless it is for someone you don't like and would like them to become financial screwed."
1,Greenway station is a total joke.  It seems like the management can't keep businesses to stay more than six months.  They don't have really any good stores that make me stop and shop.  There really is no big draw.  The resturants are worthless.  No men's stores what so ever.  On top of all this the location is horrible.  Make this a dead mall and it will be more exciting.
5,"Oh my gosh, heaven!! 

Walking inside of the place I wasn't expecting to see such a monstrosity of a restaurant. It's just huge. There's a large panaderia right when you walk in where you can order tasty Mexican pastries. You walk down a little ways and order your meal at the counter. There's a salsa bar to the right with all sorts of great salsas from spicy to mild, to avocado, etc. 

I ordered the Super Nachos and they were so good! I didn't want to stop eating them and literally gorged myself until I couldn't lift another chip into my mouth."
1,"After one bit of my grilled chicken sandwich, I instantly regretted going here. The lettuce was slimy, the mayo tasted rancid and the chicken was not hot. I threw out he sandwich. It was disgusting."
5,"AS far as libraries go, this one is a keeper.  Beautiful building, great selection, and lots of space to work or read.  I can't complain."
1,"Disappointing to say the least. Was looking forward to wine, friends, conversation and a little nosh after the artwalk...what we got was surprisingly poor customer service that became downright passive aggressive (scratch the passive) after we received a pizza that wasn't to our liking. The waiter was so upset that we didn't want mozzarella cheese on our $10 goat cheese pizza that he brought out the cook to confirm. His manager then came by our table to tell us that we, the customers, should be aware that pizza is always served with mozz cheese. (Oh really astute one?) 20 minutes later the manager returned with a pizza drowining in goat cheese and we were informed that we should be happy because we were getting ""a bang for our buck"". We felt so harassed by the wait staff because of this stupid $10 pizza that we actually feared they vandalized the food (yes, you know the feeling of wondering ""did that waiter spit in my dish""?). We left confused by the entire experience. I would never never never never never go again and I will tell everyone I know to avoid this place like the plague."
1,"The  petco near me was out of my boys favorite off the rawhide bar so, I called this store and asked if they had a rawhide bar. Yes we do--  Hoped in the car to make the six mile drive

Excuse me?  Where is your rawhide bar?  Oh I'm sorry we font have that anymore.  There are a few on the endcap over there.

Really?  Excuse me, do you have a water bowl where my dog can get a drink?  Yes, in the back of the store by the restrooms.  Uh, theres no bowl back there.  Well, maybe thats because the water fountain is broke.  I will tell the mgr tomorrow. How does that help me now?

How much  did those rawhides weigh?  .93lbs.  Over on the other scale, it was less than .75.  Let me weigh it again--oops now its .95. Really?

Here's a review you can do over the phone to get a 2 dollar discount.

I REALLY DON'T think you want me to do a review and I wont be coming back anyway

Ok, have a great day, sir"
1,"UPS needs to do review on this store and shut them down.  They are ruining the UPS brand.  The clerks who work here are very rude.  I walked in there needing to ship something specifically ""overnight"" and was given options that were not overnight/next day.  I was at the store at 1pm which is relatively early and before the cut off for next day.  I was assured that the shipping service I purchased was going to be next day.  

Then throughout the night I was checking the tracking number and the product had not left.  The next morning I call the store and they say that they still have the product.  I was sending a passport that needed to be at my destination by 2 days after the first day I initially tried to send it (I chose next day ""overnight"" to get it there one day before luckily).  After talking to the store over the phone and asking them why the package was not delivered, they told me I did not choose an ""overnight"" service.  The one thing that I specifically told them was that ""this needs to be sent overnight so that it will arrive tomorrow"".

Then they tried to charge me more money saying that I did not purchase an overnight product.  Which first of all, I asked specifically only for their overnight options, why would you give me an option that is not overnight. Second, even if your incompetent clerks selected a service that is not overnight, why would it still be there.  I am assuming if it's not overnight, it should still be on it's way for 2nd day and my 1 day cushion would save me.  

So I ask the clerk to tell the owner to give me a call.  The owner did not give me a call back and told the clerk, ""I will not settle the difference for this, he will pay it or I will throw it away.""  So the asshole wants to throw away the passport that I need to send because his staff sold me the incorrect service.  I specifically stated to his clerks that the package ""needed to be there by tomorrow"" and said ""overnight"" several times.  I paid a hefty premium as well for this service given that the product weights much less than 1 pound and I was there relatively early in the day.  

These guys are incompetent, distrustful and unreliable.  If you need to ship something important, consider using another UPS store or Fedex."
1,I got so sick and was throwing up after eating there! I have never been back since. And normally I never get sick to my stomach. I don't trust their food. And it is so overprized and overrated.
5,"THE place for lunch downtown!  Just gimme a bowl o' 'red', some crackers and a glass of icy-cold milk, and nobody gets hurt!

Tom's has been that way since before you were born, and it still is!

Oh yeah, they do have other things on the menu.  But, for the regulars...."
5,"I grew up in Texas, we had a delightfully experience eating the Whataburger and their onion rings.  Living in Vegas, there isn't anything here like it.  So when I get a chance to get one of the burgers, I go for it.  

Today, even though it's morning, I want a burger and that's what I get.  They grill the bun and it makes the burger.  I avoid mustard, not on my burger!  I love mayo and ketchup, with old fashion lettuce, tomato and pickle!  

The onion rings have changed a little, but I still like that batter and the freshness of the onions. 

This was a good burger and definitely brought me back home!"
5,"Arlo Guthrie, Henry Rollins, Toots and the Maytals are just a few of the bands on the line up this month. It's a great place to see a band, and they have good beers on tap too."
5,"Honestly, I'm not sure what to expect when eating at Hooters. So far, so good, thus, the 5 stars.  But, I do have one minor issue with them, but not enough to downgrade them.

Eating here is what I imagined the 70's to be about.  Wood paneling, that weird color orange, and a little bit of tackiness thrown in for good measure.  So far, when eating here, I have had good experiences.  The girls are nice, the place is clean, and service seems to be prompt and efficient.  I usually can be found here during lunch hour only, and so far, those have been my only experiences.  No happy hour, no dinner, no weekend service.

My only ""complaint"" is that I have carried out a few times from this location.  A handful of times, I felt like I have had terribly slow carry out service. Waiting forever for someone to take my order, waiting just as long for food, and feeling ""less important"" then maybe the dine in patrons."
1,"The food is over priced. The restaurant has no place to sit indoors.  The exteror tables aren't even covered by a shade structure to protect you during the middle of the day when they are open.  They have limited hours. The food its self its okay, but I could get the same thing for a lesser price else where. they charge you per item, even the salsa 15cents for 1oz and 50 cents for 4oz.  No way!  Never returning here."
1,"I can't stand Castle Boutique.

Just rename it ""TRASH"" and it would fit it just right.

This type of place totally makes experimenting with sex look extremely bad and I can't stand that.

I should NEVER walk into a ""fantasy toy"" store and feel like a pervert. NEVER.

And every time I have walked into this one (which is like twice), I have and ended up not buying a thing because you feel so weird.  The bright flourescent lights, the absolute lack of decor... it's just this huge warehouse of sex toys and books.  I can't stand going into grocery stores without decor, much less a place to get a toy to be turned on by.

I don't know if this specific location is like that... I've been to the one on I-17 and Deer Valley... yeah, the one with all the controversy.  It's TERRIBLE."
1,"As a veteran of the strip club scene and former dancer at Heartbreakers, now Bombshells, I'm sending out a big ""Shame on you!"" to the management at Bombshells! We rented a party bus for my best friends bachelor party and were told Bombshells was one of the clubs on the V.I.P. list. I called the club to alert of our arrival time to make sure we could get in. The person I spoke to was quite rude over the phone, but said they make decisions regarding admittance on a case by case basis. I told him we were a large group, would buy drinks, and as a former dancer, all my friends are schooled to pay the dancers well! When we got there, we were met at the door and told we would have to pay full cover and that they wouldn't do anything special for our bachelor. Lucky for us, our driver got a tip to go the the Hi-Liter, which turned out the be the best ever!! So, again, shame on you Bombshells! And to the girls who missed out on lots of money that night... go work at a real club! Peace"
5,"Trying very hard to be unbiased since this is my Saturday night spot for a year and a half now. The bar: I enjoy the employees attitude, the new country with some top 40, cupid shuffle, some throwback songs, and fairly priced drinks in this decent sized dive bar. For smokers, there's a large back patio area. An ATM is available in the darts room. Parking is in front, the back, or at Food City. The Cash has supported charities, held drag shows, and threw themed nights, like the most recent black out party, and  they also host poker games, dance lessons, and of course, karaoke. For busy nights, they have 3 bar tenders serving, 2 in the front and 1 in the rear. 

The crowd: If you're visiting or new/ transplant, compared to flashy Los Angeles, hipster Seattle, and melting pot NYC's lez scene (to name a few cities), I've noticed that this place has lots of butch lesbians, about an even number of femmes, tomboys, androgynous, and a small handful of ultra femmes. For the most part everyone's friendly. You'll see a wide age range here, along with some straights, gay boys, etc. I've also noticed a trend.... the Cash's bathrooms are never nasty and are always stocked with TP and paper towels lol.


Come by, grab a drink, get your 2 step on, or twerk and grind, or just wiggle around... at The Cash, the Cheer's of Phoenix's lesbian population, and have a great time :)"
1,I was in this Starbucks yesterday and ordered a frappicino. I asked for 2cups to help keep it insulated and frozen longer in this AZ heat and the girl at the register snapped. She first said I could only have a sleeve and the when I said I would pay for the second cup she preceded to tell me how un environmentally friendly I am. How inappropriate and out of line.  I will be sending a letter to their coroporate office
1,"Only use this store if you want your package to be lost or stolen, and never delivered!  We tried to ship two Christmas packages, and the never arrived, the store couldn't even supply tracking numbers, and they were of zero help trying to rectify the situation.  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!

NEXT TIME WE WILL USE FEDEX."
5,Great museum.  Great location.  Easy parking.  Fantastic for kids.  Amazing homeschool classes.  I highly recommend getting a membership if you find a good deal.
1,"This is about the one near Hilldale.  Awful. No stars.
 I guess we should have taken our clues form the emptiness of the restaurant and the fact happy our lasted until closing....
The margarita was a sickly peach color and was solid in the pitcher.
The plates were served with the thumb of a dirty oven mitt in the food (I'm guessing they came out of the microwave).
The enchiladas were slimy and water-logged covered in a dilute, flavorless ""mole"" (i wouldn't call it that.
The rice was instant and without any seasoning, not even salt,  with a couple bits of also favor less corn.  The waiter did one of those disinterested ""howseverythinggoingeverythingokay"" before we flagged him back to say it was inedible. We declined his offer to make it again and just received a bill for the margaritas that we also left.
On the way, when we commented on how gross the food looked as well as tasted, another dinner confirmed she would never go there again.
So we went across the road to Pascals and had real margaritas and excellent enchiladas with Mole.
Stay away!"
5,"I have no idea why no one has reviewed this awesome B&B but i'm excited to be the first...perhaps no one wants to let anyone in on the secret...and i thought about not writing the review for that same reason but i have to share this one with my fellow yelpsters. I wanted to celebrate the wife's bday with a quick getaway but didn't want to stay in the usual hotel. so i popped ""lgbt friendly B&Bs"" into google and this place came up. they had a few rooms to choose from but of course the one with the hot tub in the room caught my eye first. i emailed them through the website and the owner Craig got back to me quickly. I reserved the room and then just had to wait until the day arrived. Even though we were arriving earlier than the 3PM check in, Craig was awesome and left a personalized letter and the keys to the house in the mailbox for us to let ourselves in. we put our stuff in the room and when we came downstairs the owners, Craig and Cathy were there and welcomed us to the house, even remembering that we were there for a surprise birthday trip. the house was clean and the room was nicely done. it was definitely more cozy than any hotel room could have ever been, the bed was so comfortable we almost napped thru our dinner reservation! the hot tub was definitely the highlight of the Mentor room, the massage jets were awesome and were so relaxing! in the AM Craig made an awesome breakfast complete with bacon, an egg souffle and a homemade Kringle that was absolutely delish! i couldn't have picked a better place to celebrate my gf's birthday! from the second i made the reservation until the moment we checked out, Craig and Cathy made us feel at home and provided top knotch service to us. If I'm ever in need of a quick getaway to Madison I know exactly where I will stay!!"
5,"I am a native of the Phoenix area.  There are a lot of Mexican food restaurants but there are very few that I would call excellent.   Comedor Guadalajara is an excellent restaurant.   I have been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The Chilaquilles for breakfast are very good.   You can get them plain or with Machaca beef.   The enchilada sauce at Comeodor Guadalajara is incredible especially smothered over a red chili con carne burrito.  There is not much I can complain about at this restaurant.  The service is very good and the pricing is affordable.   If I was to make a complaint, it would be that the place gets too crowded at lunch time.   Go before 11:15 AM for lunch or you will have to wait for a seat especially on Friday.  I guess that is a good problem to have from the restarurant point of view.   I highly recoomend this place."
1,"Underwhelming - attention to detail is lacking. Carpets are dirty, empty bottle of wine in the fridge when I opened it for the first time, the AC was not running when I checked-in so the room smelled musty - like beer was being fermented in the bathtub. There are no electric plug near the bed - I was to be sitting on my bed and charging my phone and working on my computer. Wifi is free but does not reach to my room... Come-ON!"
5,"I am 40 years old and have lived in Phoenix my whole life.  I have a passion for discovering new and unique restaurants around the valley.  As a child, I was raised on Jordan's Mexican food every Sunday after church.  I'm an atheist now, but I still frequent Jordan's for their hot sauce, tacos and delicious burritos, chimichangas and cheese crisps.  
I went to Tacos De Juarez for the first time a week ago after a D-backs game.  I ate a pizza at the game, but had to try the food at this place because it looked like a diamond in the rough.  After eating there, I have discovered; it is a diamond.  The food is absolutely amazing! The tacos have shells that are prepared in house, and the salsas are amazing.  I have been there one time since, and am planning on going tomorrow.  I cannot wait to try their selection of mariscos."
5,"Normally pithy nicknames and a vegetarian friendly mission statement scares this carniverous reviewer off.   Usually the wit bespeaks hippy cliche and the veggy-weirdo friendly menu ensures I'll struggle to find anything that once moo'd and if I do, it will taste like processed rubber.

Not so at ""That's a Wrap.""  My wife describes this adorable wrap shop as being one which makes both her inner slut and inner fat girl happy.  It allowed her to eat good food until she was full without feeling guilty about ruining her diet.   She enjoyed the my sherry amore.  I enjoyed the Rocky VII, basically a cheesesteak wrap.  Both were excellent.  The pasta salad was pedestrian but decent and the fresh fruit salad was spectacularly fresh.   

Very reasonably priced and an aesthetically pleasing interior.   Parking is a bitch though a serious problem if you go during a busy time like the lunch hour.  Have someone who can parralel park do the driving."
1,"Well folks, I did the chain thing. I confess. Rickie and I had spent and exhausting day (and a quick $200) at Target and were thinking steaks. The budget didn't include Morton's or Ruth's Chris. I had brain freeze and forgot the local spots I love so much that grill a mean meat (i.e. Phoenix City Grill), so the first restaurant past Target that fit the bill was our local Applebee's on Camelback and Central. Mind you, I don't expect a decor marvel or a hostess so hip it hurts. I know what i'm getting myself into. For the most part. But I had recently seen a TV commercial from Applebee's and of course the food was airbrushed so perfectly like Celine Dion's face on the current issue of HELLO magazine. I mean, really, Celine, you have no wrinkles even after living in Las Vegas these past couple of years? Anyhoo, we were greeted and seeted promptly by a teenager who definitley just had a smoke and could use a visit to the tanning booth. Once seated, our server, Mo, took our drink and appetizer order and quickly disappeared. For quite awhile. Cue the Jeoporady theme music. Once our iced teas and the new appetizer (tuscan cheese bread extravangza) arrived we sipped and dipped. Not bad.Raspberry tea with an univited yet delighted visit by vanilla and the cheese spread was rich and yummy served with a spot of diced tomato, basi and garlic...aka bruscetta. NICE. We ordered onion chips, like an onion loaf or the blooming onion at Outback....they were good. Two sauces for our dipping pleasure...one your typical ranch, the other a sort of spiced up thousand island with horseradish. Then the entrees arrived. Cue the creepy dum, dum, dum, music...Both NY strip steaks over cooked to such an extreme. The asparagus was limp like, well, let's just say it reminded me of a Vietmanese gymnast I once dated who didn't take the little blue pill. Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal! The clientele was like a scene out of Dawn of the Dead. Sorry. Lesson learned...Applebee's ok some of the time. Get an app and a drink. Skip the entrees. Be nice to a nice server. And for God's sake don't expect a steak worthy of the big chain peeps."
5,This place is so close to the airport that if you have a significant layover you could pull an Anthony Bourdain and catch a cab to Comedor Guadalajara. The food is sensational!  The green chile is flavorful and thick.  We had the specials of camarón with nopalitos in chile rojo served in a molcajete  as well as fajitas de carne asada and tripe. My Finance got the green chile shredded beef chimi smothered in green chile sauce enchilada style. She did this on a yelp recommendation. Comedor Guadalajara is the best Mexican food I've had in quite some time.
1,Tried to purchase some DJ equipment from this company. My order was denied because my billing address for my credit card was different from my shipping address. Really?! I run several companies and have never run into to this. One of my companies the billing address is our PO Box and the mailing address is the store front or what if I wanted to send a gift to someone? I obviously can't do it through Full Compass.  Also why do you offer the option of a alternate billing or mailing address? Doesn't make sense especially in this economy. I'll be sure to send along my $600+ receipt from the company that's okay with a different mailing address.
5,"Monty's Blue Plate is a local gem.  Expect unique menu items that focus on tasty, healthy, and fresh.  They have things like burgers that you would expect at any diner but they do their own unique spin on standards.  My latest meal was a burger with carmelized onions, herbed goat cheese, and spinach..  Sooo good.  They are also sort of famous for their bean salad - even my two year old goes for that one.

After your meal you have an array of some of the best cakes and pies.  Their carrot cake is the best I have ever had and sometimes we will go there just for that!"
5,"I like this place. The service was prompt with a smile. Everytime I went while visiting Madison the coffee was great. They either have an excellent roaster, or train their staff really well (or both). I  like my coffee to taste like coffee. Not the sugary, foo foo, macha frappa jacka whatever. 

So if you believe that coffee roasting is an art and not a fad, check this place out. It has a great energy too. Local art and jewelry designers are supported there and there is a cozy fireplace! Good post movie date spot"
1,"Great cupcakes and cookies.  Unfortunately - worst customer service in the world.  It's a shame.  Twice now,  they have goofed up my cupcake order.  No apologies for the mistakes both times.  On one occasion, they completely forgot about the order.  I was told I would just have to buy items out of the case - which I did.  No problem.  However, there were not enough cupcakes to fill the order and I was charged the full order price.  When I pointed out that they had overcharged me by $9, the manager rolled her eyes at me.  Started slamming things around and told me sharply I would have to WAIT for the refund.   So you forget my order, don't apologize, overcharge for the replacement order, then have a hissyfit when I ask for the correct price. Wow. Unbelievable."
1,I waited 20 minutes for my asiago bagel and I was the only one in the dining area  but they forgot about it and burned my bagel. Service is terrible.
5,"I work in central Phoenix and have heard good things about the restaurant. Finally got there for lunch with a friend and we both found the menu to have many items that we would love to try. I decided to have the tuna steak sandwich. It was served open faced and seared which is perfect.  Was seasoned deliciously and accompanied by a fresh side salad.  We had a friendly server, Meggie who was polite enough to write down the name of wine we tasted.  I will be back...soon."
5,"I've brought business contacts and executives from my firm to Louisiannes'.  Always they have been impressed with the quality of the food, the ambiance of the facility and the attentiveness of the staff.  It compares well with top quality restaurants all over the world."
1,"DO NOT TAKE YOUR DOG HERE unless you want him to come back cut up and bleeding.  I brought my shih-tzu here to be groomed by Sylvia and when I picked my dog up he was shaking and visibly upset.  When we got home, he wouldn't walk, run, play, or even go to the bathroom or eat and drink.  My dog is two years old, this is very out of character for him.  I knew something was wrong with his back leg because he wouldn't put weight on it, and upon closer inspection I noticed that the entire inside of his leg had been cut up by the clippers.  His skin was raw and bleeding, and there were other spots on his back that looked the same.  I immediately called Petsmart and they told me to come back and they would reimburse me.  I returned the next day and asked that they have their vet check him out as well, because the situation had not improved over night.  They agreed to refund me and have the Banfield vets look at him.  I ran home to get my dog, and brought him back.  When I arrived, I was told I would be next in line, right after the dog in front of me because he was an emergency.  Ok, not a problem.  Then another dog was seen and helped, then another dog, so I finally went up and asked how long I could anticipate to sit there waiting on a Sunday afternoon.  The woman couldn't give me an estimate and told me I would have to wait until all of the appointments were seen first.  I, once again, asked to speak with the manager, who does nothing for managing situations whatsoever, and he told me that because they are a separate business, they couldn't do anything about the wait.  Needless to say, I left.  For $56 + $10 in tip, I can find a groomer who will treat my dog correctly and humanely, and I will not have to worry about them coming home injured.  I will never return to Petsmart for grooming, nor will I set foot in this Petsmart for anything again.  There are quite a few other pet stores and groomers in the area and I'm sure their level of service will exceed Petsmart's lack in customer service tenfold."
5,"4.5 stars.

This is my favorite place to shop in Madison, and I've tried them all, many times.

Fresh-squeezed orange juice? Check. Decently priced bread? Check. Good produce? Check. Knowledgeable butcher? Check. Great wine selection & prices? Check. Not the Co-op? Check.

The problem with Woodman's is it sucks the life force out of you and makes you want to stick your head in a toilet, though goods are so cheap that you return again and suffer again and so on. The problem with the Co-op is . . . well, it's The Co-Op. Good for some things, important for ethically raised, locally sourced meat, but but but but but. 

Jenifer St. Market is a great local joint that really is a midway type of place. It's easy to get around in, which is probably its greatest strength. You can't find everything here, but you can find most things. I often find too much candy, but that's my own idiosyncratic problem. The wine selection is pretty good and the prices are really reasonable! I got two bottles last night, one white and one red, and didn't pay more than $12 for either. The meat counter is superb, though the ethical meat selection isn't so hot (they do sell Bare rotisserie chickens and Bell and Evans whole and pieced chickens, same as the Co-Op). 

Some downsides:

-Extremely annoying cash-only policy. There's a free ATM out front (you get charged $1 and then the machine gives you a $1 coupon). 

 -The market seems to have a policy of only hiring 16-year-old girls who have never packed a grocery bag or even bought groceries before. One girl once literally threw a tomato into my bag while I looked on with horror."
5,"For Madison, this BBQ is pretty spectacular. Anywhere else and I'd give it 4 stars but, considering the location, it's damn good and deserving of 5 stars.

The food's good, the staff is friendly, and (for freshly-made BBQ) the service is usually quick."
5,"Finally got to try this place and it did not disappoint. Amazing burgers... 

The PB&B (peanut butter) was insane. The special was the champion burger with caramelized onions and it was great too, but I would definitely go with the peanut butter one again..and again. 

Also had a a homemade biscuit with honey and it was crazy good. Prob try a fried chicken biscuit sandwich next time. 

Place has a lot of character. Old RV converted into a restaurant. Minimal indoor seating but not a bid deal. Wish I lived closer... Great place."
1,"If I could give this pharmacy zero stars I would have. 
My husband went in to use their shipping services and the lady with short hair was completely rude.  She stated, ""that you are raping us of our shipping supplies"". The term ""rape"" was used. WOW! He was using USPS shipping material and shipping it from their store. USPS offers these flat rate shipping boxes as a means to ship priority. Meaning we are paying for the services. 
I would hope management of this pharmacy get extra help. With employees like these they may go out of business. 
I would NOT recommend their service to anyone. Do NOT come here if you are looking for customer service. 
I am appalled with her behavior and the pharmacy's service."
5,"Had our wedding here and it was fantastic! Absolutely loved working with Stacey - she answered all our questions and got back to us in a timely manner. They were totally flexible and the servers/bartenders were phenomenal! We have had nothing but compliments about our wedding, I would recommend Windsor in a heartbeat!

Because we booked our wedding reception on Friday night we were told we would be receiving a ""complimentary"" champagne toast. After the wedding though we received a bill charging us for the service fee and gratuity for pouring the champagne. We paid it without any grievances, but it would have been nice if they would have informed us of this when we were going over the preliminary invoice. Other than this minor issue, Windsor was wonderful!"
1,"I had to take my to-go order back 3 times because they got it wrong and the 3rd time, I took 5 bites of my salad before realizing there were crispy noodles in there that I SPECIFICALLY asked them not to put in because I have Celiac Disease and can't tolerate gluten.  Needless to say, I got very sick and am now home in bed instead of at work because of it. The girl at the take out counter, Tina, had the audacity to tell me it was my fault because she didn't hear me say it the second time I had to call back in because my order was wrong.  The 3rd time I went in after I realized I was going to get sick, I just asked for a refund.  The tall guy working was very nice and apologized over and over saying he would buy my meal next time but I won't be back."
5,I cannot wait until sir hobos open up again. This place has the best breakfast anywhere!  The skillet are to die for. This service is as good as any diner in Chicago.
5,"Oh, I love you, Comedor Guadalajara.  R.I.L.F.

I loved you when you were also The Crystal Palace.  I loved you as a child, when we would try to sneak into the pseudo-night club side and take peeks and our moms would drag us back like trouble-making ne'er-do-wells. 

You've changed a lot since then, dropping the Crystal Palace half of your moniker, but your food is still as good as it always was.  You're cheap, you taste great and you give a lot, even if your looks aren't spectacular, just like my favorite hookers (what?).

The Pechuga Asada, two whole chicken breasts grilled and tender, on top of a mound of rice and beans, is so delectable and awesome that I want to eat it constantly.  But how can I, when the machaca chimichanga enchilada-style with plentiful guacamole and other assorted accoutrement beckon me?  

And what of you, Green Chili?  Your almost-soupy consistency, the potatoes, the carne, the color, the tortilla...too much to handle.  

Oh, others, they will say that it tastes the same as other Mexican restaurants to them.  That's because they haven't been spoon-fed all this shit for the past 25 years like we have, day in and day out, beaners that we are.  We can taste the slightest change in the amount of cumin, or how much salt, or the way someone cuts their meat before cooking it, or the way they make their spanish rice, because we've eaten so damned much of it. 

So that's how I know that this isn't so run-of-the-mill.  That's why I love you, Comedor Guadalajara.  

You're totally still a cutie, even at your ripe old age.  R.I.L.F:  Restaraunt I'd Like t....nevermind."
1,"Worst BK I've ever been to. That may not sound so serious considering its a fast food place but its terrible even by fast food standards. Orders take at least 10 minutes to complete and 25 percent of the time they come out wrong. I don't know how but their burgers are the worst, dry and tasteless. Aren't these food products supposed to be foolproof? I thought the renovation would've brought new employees and better service but this shiny apple is rotten inside. Never again."
1,"The yelp reviews were so good I wanted to believe I found a new mechanic, unfortunately not the case for me."
1,"I think the service at Lowe's is consistently so much better then Home Depot, but this Home Depot is the closest home improvement store to where I live.  I went in today asking if they had free standing fans.  The women pointed at one type of box fan on an end cap.  I asked her if there were any others and her response was, ""No, it is August, what do you expect?  You should have bought one in June.""
You know what i expect?  I expect a store to stock the things they sell, and not give me attitude when they don't have what I need, but I guess that is to much to ask of Home Depot."
5,"I love the az center. My wife and I have been coming here for years. When we have an evening from the kids, this where we will catch a movie at the amc. There is a romantic give after the sun sets."
1,"My wife and I have enjoyed lunch at Luke's just  about every Saturday since we met in 2008. She introduced me to Italian beef and is a native of Chicago. We first visited one of the two in Tucson and then alternated between the three -now one left--in the Phoenix area. We normally split an Italian beef; extra beef, cheese, sweet peppers, dipped; two extra crispy fries and an order of their homemade, batter dipped, onion rings. The food is awesome and I've had many of the items on the menu. The down side is the service. Now, I don't need the staff to be all happy and smiley but politeness and customer oriented I do expect. The owner and employees seem to be bothered by customers coming in to order food. A son of the owner of the Phoenix area restaurant(s) ran a place in Chandler, it was very nice and consistently packed with a  steady flow of customers and pleasantries from the staff. Not sure why papa didn't want junior to succeed, especially when his old man and brother own the two in Tucson. Seems you would want this to keep going with the family and be proud of a the legacy.  Anyway the Chandler store was closed without a word to the steady customer they knew by name and order. Then the same thing happened to the Scottsdale location. Showed up one Saturday and the place is empty and up for lease.
 
So, for food the rating would get all 5 stars from me, but the service leaves a bad taste in my mouth - pun intended. Still we come back every other week and search frantically for a quality Italian beef elsewhere."
5,"Good bbq and simple clean restaurant. The staffs is helpful and friendly I will definitely be back. Loved the pork ribs,,, sweet potato tater tots..and slaw"
1,My be got food here once and all of it was just thrown together and cold . I thought I'd play it safe and get a frosty today since my one surgery can't eat fast food . So there was something in my frosty I almost puked and had to throw it away . Don't go to this location
1,This location is a hot mess.  I love the Cheese Cake Factory but this locaton is not up to the standards that I accustomed to from this company.  Choose another location The waitress smelled like a pack of cigarettes.  So standing over me taking my order made my stomach turn.  Then my rice was undercooked.  When I told them it was undercooked they wanted to question me and say are you sure.  Im Asian I eat rice almost everyday.  There were Nat's flying around the food.  I won't be back to this location.
5,"Words cannot express my love for La Tolteca. Well, not English words and I no habla Espanol. But I'll try...

SUPER NACHOS MOTHERFUCKER!!!

Nacho cheese, tons of cilantro, chicken, beef, beans, onions, tomatos, salsa, more cheese piled into a HUGE box. A huge box!

............................................................................... THUD

I just passed out.

Also great everything else. and cheap as hell. Like pesos cheap.

!ah dios mio!"
1,"I stopped in early on a Thursday afternoon to get a flat tire fixed (just needed a new tube).  I was ignored for the first 10-15 minutes, as was another customer who asked me if I knew how to get any service at the shop.

A repair tech finally came up to me, I told them what was wrong.  Apparently, they were too busy tuning up bikes to change the tube (a 5 minute job, tops), and not one employee could spare the time to do this.  They told me that it would have to wait until after the weekend.  No matter HOW busy a shop is, I cannot possibly imagine having to wait any more than a day to get a tube replaced, let alone four days.  I inquired about this and was treated in a rude manner, no apologies about the initial lack of service or the long repair times.

I ended up walking my bike 2 miles to Machinery Row, where I had a fantastic (albeit more expensive) experience.

Compared to the rest of the bike shops I have been to in Madison, this one is by far the worst."
1,"I have never written a review before but felt i had to.  This place sucks!  Went here with 3 other friends for dinner.   My osso buco was below average, flavorless, and dry.   We had garlic bread which was 5 pieces of cold, stale french bread drizzled with olive oil and dried oregano.  R u kidding me??  My guests were disappointed with their dishes as well and the dinner was not deserving of such high prices.  Some of it came out cold!   Dinner for 4 of us was WAY overpriced.  Only thing good was desert.  Service was just OK, but he didnt take much time to check on us.  The owner thinks he's a 5 star chef.  Gimme a break dude.  Plastic water cups with these prices??  Go to North, or any other place for that matter.  Sign out front is super tacky.  Guy Fieri must have been stoned when he reviewed this place, or else the quality has sunk.  I believe it was years ago anyways."
1,"Overpriced, overrated, HORRIBLE SERVICE!  

When asked for a spoon with which to eat my pasta, they actially gave me an iced tea spoon!

No bartender, I sat for 15 minutes without a greeting, anything. The grey-haired manager stomped aroumd the restaurant avoiding all contact with customers.  What's the point/benefit on that?

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AT THIS AMATEURISH OVERPRICED DUMP!  INSTEAD, GO TO MEATBALLZ IN THE SAME CENTER,ON CAMELBACK. MUCH BETTER FOOD, REASONABLE PRICES AND NO ICED TEA SPOONS!"
1,"Normally I would never pick to eat at the Cheesecake Factory, ever, but a co-worker picked it for a work function, so off we went. 

There were about 10 of us in our group, and before we ordered we apologized to our waitress for needing separate checks. I think 7 checks in all. They seemed cool with it...at first. 

I have to preface by saying, the worst service I've ever received has been at the Cheesecake Factory. Out of the four times I've been, every single time has been horrendous. The very first time I went (this was a different location)  one of my dining partners didn't get their meal for 20 minutes after ours. We were completely through with our meals but the server never offered to comp her meal. In fact, he was never seen after taking our order. We had to flag down a manager to take care of the issue. 

The other few times I've had the slowest, rudest service of my life. This time was no different. The server acted thoroughly annoyed by our group, was short with us, refused to smile AT ALL, and generally was a complete wench. Splitting the tab was clearly WAY too much work for her, as it took 20 minutes for her to figure out who ordered what (even though we asked if it was ok to split tabs long before we ordered) but actually running the tabs? Wow, add on another 10 minutes! We apologized again for having to split tabs, hoping maybe that would make her less huffy, but she never acknowledged that we were trying to be nice, and instead just went around acting huffy and like we were thorns in her side. 

Well, obviously she could be a total b*tch because gratuity was already included. 18% on the tab, which I understand with large groups. However, I felt she was acting as bitchy as she wanted to because in the end, she'd be getting a good tip regardless. 

As for the food, it's a big whatever. Anything other than lunch is overpriced. In the end it's just overpriced ridiculously sized chain food . I don't understand why people love it so much. I hope for the rest of my life I never step foot in one again. I know I won't be missing much."
1,Abysmal food and service.  Has gotten progressively worse over the years.  Just an expensive Taco Bell.
1,"Good looking talent and really good food specials will always bring the customers into this place. I will NOT return to this establishment again when in the area for business.
The cocktail/food service was the worst service in all of Phoenix. If management knew how much money that was not spent because of this lousy service, heads would most definitely roll...."
5,"This place isn't much to look at; in fact it's terrifying. They have Christmas ornaments with lights stung up all year long, which is bizarre. But so what...

Their breakfast sandwiches are delicious, greasy, and just bad for you. Very enjoyable. If you want a ""feel good"" moment, come here for a breakfast croissant.

And now on to the star of the show: Donuts. Made fresh every day. If you come early enough (the earliest I came was at 4am on Valentine's Day!) the donuts are still warm.

I cannot say in just one post how delicious and AWESOME their donuts are. Greasy, decadent, bad for you...something for everyone! 

Yes this is as good as it gets, folks. Try this place out, either for breakfast and/or donuts. You won't be disappointed."
1,"High-Pressure wash?  maybe.  High-Pressures sales?  DEFINITELY.

Daughter gave my wife a gift of a detail from Lindstrom.  At the time, it was an $85 full detail special, but my wife being the procrastinator she is, waited many months before using the card.  Checked the website and the detail special was gone,  No big deal, it was a gift card, so we thought we would take her car down and get what we could for the $85.

She drives up and the pitch begins.  What can I get for $85?  Salesman goes through the list and says for a bit more, you can get scratches buffed out. super-detailing, yada, yada, yada, inside of tires cleaned even!  (Ok, that last part was exaggeration).  Salesman says ""that'll be $200"".  Um, no, wife says, I have $85.  I want what I can get for $85.  Salesman says okay, and walks away.  Five minutes later, Salesman comes back, taps on window (she's been waiting all this time), and says, ""Okay, we can add interior/exterior detailing and shampooing the carpets and cleaning the seats for $100 more.""  No, she says again, I only have $85, that's what I want to spend.  Okay, he says, we'll drop the inside-tire cleaning, and the scratch-buffing and just add the inside seat-cleaning.  worn down and impatient, she agrees to it.  That'll be $120.  Whatever, she says, just let me get out of this hell.

Meanwhile, I'm waiting outside to take her to our next appointment, which we barely made, after all this heckling.  Two and a half hours later, the car comes back, it looks very nice from a distance, all shiny and trim and  tires blackened. But when you look closer, there are still bug smears on the front of the hood, which I was able to clean off with some simple green, and the seats weren't that clean - at least not to warrant that much extra.  Overall, it was a fair job.  Would I pay $120 for it again?  No, I don't think so.  And after the sales pitch my wife endured, we will not be returning.

Suggestion for Lindstrom.  It's okay to sell your services and to upsell.  Badgering and pressuring customers however, is not okay.  It's better to work with your customers, and within their budget.  Oh, and for $120, you could do a better job of cleaning.  Or maybe not, just saying.  At any rate, you have lost me as a customer, and I've been a customer for twenty years now.  Not any more."
5,"I simply cannot say enough good things about Millennium.  I called last minute to see if they could get me in for a hair cut.  They were able to get me in that evening to see Jamie.  I have really long hair, so my experiences with hair cuts have been all over the board.  Jamie did such an amazing job!  She was friendly and did exactly what I wanted.  I also had her give me bangs (Reese Witherspoon type) which I haven't had since I was a kid...I have had nothing but compliments on my new look since!  Jamie suggested a product for my bangs but didn't push anything like a lot of spas/salons do.  Their atmosphere is very clean and hip...great music playing and a very welcoming vibe.  I will be visiting Millennium for hair cuts as well as facials, as they use my favorite line of Dermalogica products.  Check them out if you haven't yet-especially if you are considering a new look!"
1,"I stumbled across this quaint bookstore today, and as I was looking through a stack of books, the peaceful ambience of the store was suddenly shattered by the sound of the guy at the desk  screaming ""DON'T TOUCH THOSE BOOKS!  THOSE BOOKS AREN'T ON SHELVES!  Well then why are they stacked up here with no indication that they're off limits?  And as for shelves, why are you offering books for sale that are displayed, God forbid, on a table nearby?  This guy is lucky to have any customers (I was there for a good a half-hour and no one else came in) and yet he chooses to scream at the only one in the store?  I scampered out feeling humiliated and shamed, but I later realized that it was his behavior that was shameful.  Oh, and the books are way overpriced.  And the guy had Christmas music playing. In May?  I shall never return to this crazy, unwelcoming place as long as this scary man is inside it."
5,Amazing food. Friendly owners. Wonderful outdoor patio!
5,"This is one of my all-time favorite places to grab a quick (and casual) bite downtown. The service is consistently excellent, and the owners are extremely friendly. They are flexible with their menu, too - they do their best to get you exactly what you want. 

I recommend the stuffed avocado salad. It's a special, and boy is it amazing. The fruit here is also superb - always so fresh! My friends and I swear they have someone designated to just cut fruit all day, it's so fresh. The hummus is the best hummus in town. Get it with extra veggies!

The only downfall Athenian has is it's hours. Monday thru Friday til 5, closed on the weekends. No fun for those of us who live in the area. But other than the short hours, this is one of my favorite places in the area - I would recommend it to anyone."
1,DANGER DO NOT GO TO THIS JIFFY LUBE!!!!!! This place is crazy and very scary. I was surrounded by really weird employees running around in a state of chaos. The manager is yelling at this kid with a bad attitude who's  rolling his eyes at the manager and scowling. I did not get my car vacuumed out which I thought was part of the service. Stay away from this creepy out of control business. I'll be calling Jiffylube. I deserve better.
5,"Love the accommodating menu and atmosphere.. I can't wait to go back, I'm already craving their chicken basil.. umm umm good!!"
1,"We called them once to fix our heat, -$200. We called them, again, -$500. Oh and that was without giving us an estimate. Just making the repairs and sending us a bill. And the system was still broken. We finally called another company and the problem was fixed. HVAC problems can be tough, but there isn't much reason to take a chance with this company. There are plenty of other HVAC companies who are more competent and communicative."
1,"uggggh!  That this how I feel at the moment when I think about the Slippery Pig. I had such high hopes for this place and could have given them so much business but damn how hard is it to order a part? I keep getting the run around ""we just have to order a fork."" Meanwhile my friend has dropped off 3 forks of various sizes to help move the process along faster. 
Some creep who acts like he's too cool to talk to a girl who likes to ride bikes straight up lied to me about timing when it would be ready. I have it writing, fool! When I went in to check out the status of my bike on the day he promised the bike would be ready that same creep immediately got a strong attitude. Just a reactionary guy I guess but seriously he scared me.
So after getting the run around going on 2 weeks of hearing ""we are going to order the part tomorrow"" I'm picking up my bike today and I'll just fix the damn thing myself.  I fully expect my bike to be destroyed when I go in to get it. That's just the kind of confidence I have in this place. Bummer."
1,"I have been going to this nail place for over a year now, especially because it is near my work. I only have an hour for lunch so this location was good. HOWEVER, after giving them good consistent business for over a year, I was treated RUDELY because a local celebrity came in (Linda Williams - news anchor for fox 10). Half-way into my appointment, Linda Williams comes in. The manager makes my nail technician leave me and do Linda Williams job. I had to wait 15 minutes until I got attention again. The funny thing is I ACTUALLY made an appointment. Because of the delay, I did not get good treatment. I had to rush because I had to be back at work. I had to rush out of there. The manager didn't even offer to comp my service. 

THIS IS BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE TO THE CORE AND I WILL NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN!"
5,"Science is fun! That may be something I never thought I'd say as a 9th grader in Biology class, but they didn't exactly have interactive kiosks and displays in my middle school classroom. If they had, I'd have screamed back then.

So that's what this entire edifice is all about. A shrine to scientific exploration. A Mecca of mechanical, natural and experimental marvels. But it's all broken down so the kiddos can appreciate. In my case, THIS kiddo can appreciate the digestible nuggets of information organized into pods of focus.

I can definitely recommend the Forces of Nature exhibit. It runs about every 15 mins, and takes you through tornadoes, forest fires, hurricanes, earthquakes and the extreme Arizona heat. It's all simulated with fans, water, shaking platforms, lights, and heat lamps. Pretty rad, and the kids will definitely want to do it a few times. I know I did.

Be sure to check out each floor. Take that elevator all the way up. If you're antsy, it's still going to take you a couple of hours to get around to everything. With more discovery in your bones, you're going to need the better part of an afternoon, or even close to a day. There's a cafe there, but I didn't get to try it and can't vouch for it.

As is the case with most museums or places like this, the exhibits come and go. Some are meant to be temporary, others will be around for years. So visit the website to see what you're in store for. You can upgrade your ticket if you're interested in some of the bonus features. When I was there there was some kind of sky-cycle-on-a-cable you could pay to ride.

I had a blast being a kid here. Looking, playing, touching, learning. In all truth, it will probably stand as one of my fondest memories of 2013. A day spent learning, exploring, and being one of the kids. Terrific."
1,"I LOVE Einstein bagels. A LOT. Bet bagels I have had. We live right by this location and go there often but today was my last time I will go to this specific one. It is so dirty. I will give them a break that yes it was Presidents' Day so they were probably busy ... But there was trash on every table, all over the floor, the coffee bar area was disgusting, and the last straw was the gross bathroom. You can tell it had not been cleaned in months. There was so much grime on the sink and the paper towel dispenser I was majorly grossed out. It makes me wonder how clean the kitchen area really was. My order was wrong which Happens no big deal... On top of that I have never had good customer service there- next time I will drive the extra 10 minutes out of my way to the location on Tatum and shea's- they're always friendly and it's very clean there."
1,"Ahh Postino Wine Bar... Or is it Postinos? Or Postino Wine Cafe? Whatever! 

I would definitely consider myself a Postino expert. Postino was a go to for countless dates of mine. I have been to all of the locations and my experience at this location has unfortunately changed. 

When I first stated going to this Postino I loved it! Me and my roommate would visit every Sunday religiously. We always got great service! Food was fantastic and timely. But it seems as if the the 40th street location is either under new management or just has new rude employees. I no longer go to this location because of a couple negative encounters with servers. I had no idea it was there business how many women I take on dates there. You would think the business would be appreciated. I was shocked when a server made a snide comment about my dating habits right in front of a lady friend. I would have been pretty pissed if that was an actual date. Very unprofessional staff at this location!

I recommend going to the newer Central & Camelback location if you are planning on visiting Postino. 

Pros:
- cheap tasty bruschetta
- reasonable wine prices
- decent beers on tap
- crazy fast but borderline annoying water refills
- short wait times

Cons
- rude servers
- shallow menu
- bad for taking dates"
1,Do not eat here. Terrible.
1,Bought an apple pie and it went moldy in two days. Brie was expensive and the worst tasting I've ever had.
1,"Yelp alerted me that I have a review to complete, from nearly 2 years ago. 

I remember how I felt about this place back then, and still feel strongly about this place now. Recollections of how much I would not like to return to this place again. 

Find a place that serves Cuban-inspired food, or if there is a frozen aisle that does, heat it up in a microwave, transfer it onto a plate, and voila! Of course you'll remember to remove that non-microwaveable plastic film that Havana overlooked."
5,"Each trip home I need, need to stop by here  for the requisite small turtle sundae: its melty eggshell-white frozen custard, hot fudge, caramel, a pile of pecans and cherry on top makes my day. Or my year. 

Take a pint to-go, too. I'm currently dreaming about their pumpkin custard. Mmm."
1,Bill our server was terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"DON'T EXPECT HOUSTON'S!

We heard Houston's became Hillstone so as very loyal customers to Houston's (going 2+ times per month) for years, we were excited to try Hillstone on Camelback. What a disappointment! 

The service was just awful, very cold and impersonal; one person in our group said ""hoity toity,"" and the food was more expensive and not as quality compared to Houston's menu. Everything about Hillstone is the opposite of Houston's. Where the seating and atmosphere at Houston's was warm and inviting, at Hillstone it is cold and impersonal. 

Yes, obviously much money was spent on Hillstone but in our opinion, to its disadvantage because of its slight ostentatious presentation. It is pretty but something about it felt off.

We tried Hillstone two times in case the first time was a fluke but our experience was the same as the first. Bummer for them because at our favorite restaurants we always tip 30-45% of our bill.

In their defense two things:
1) Our experience was from the first year it opened which I noticed there are so many similar reviews to mine from that time, so maybe they made some adjustments and,

2) Maybe they are not trying to be like Houston's which is fine for them but not for us. We miss Houston's and wanted a version of it. Hillstone is not it. So we will keep searching."
1,"For a long time when my mate and I walked past the store he would mention he would like an IPOD. So being the perfect mate I bought him one for his birthday. He opens it and said, why did you buy this I would never use it. I will spare you the rest of the conversation. So I go back to the store with the product in hand. I tell them I want to return this, I tell them why. They seem totally dumbfounded and find it very hard to accept that I indeed did not want the product. SO they ask a million question all assuming I did something to the product and rendered it unusable. Any fool can see it never came out of the box. So I repeat why I am returning it. Finally they say ok and tell me there is a restocking fee. I say OK as I had read the receipt. He said wait a minute. So I wait and he returns with what I assume is the manager. He starts his bull crap and literally yells at me about the fee and said I am going to have to pay it. I respond that yes I know of the fee as I told Him, point at the other employee. I have no problem with that, never did, never said I did. They finally took it and credited my card minus the fee all while they snarled at me. I guess I will never find out if I like Apple products as nothing on Gods green earth will ever induce me to buy from such imbecilic company."
5,I was on the hunt for good Peach Cobbler and heard good reviews about this place. And i had the Peach Cobbler w Ice Cream. It tasted just like Grandma used to make. Next time im in Phoenix ill try other stuff on the Menu and top it off with Peach Cobbler. The Guys were more than Friendly and Personable and thats why i left a Decent tip in the jar.
1,"DO NOT TAKE YOUR DOG HERE to be groomed unless you want him to come back cut up and bleeding.  I brought my shih-tzu here to be groomed by Sylvia and when I picked my dog up he was shaking and visibly upset.  When we got home, he wouldn't walk, run, play, or even go to the bathroom or eat and drink.  My dog is two years old, this is very out of character for him.  I knew something was wrong with his back leg because he wouldn't put weight on it, and upon closer inspection I noticed that the entire inside of his leg had been cut up by the clippers.  His skin was raw and bleeding, and there were other spots on his back that looked the same.  I immediately called Petsmart and they told me to come back and they would reimburse me.  I returned the next day and asked that they have their vet check him out as well, because the situation had not improved over night.  They agreed to refund me and have the Banfield vets look at him.  I ran home to get my dog, and brought him back.  When I arrived, I was told I would be next in line, right after the dog in front of me because he was an emergency.  Ok, not a problem.  Then another dog was seen and helped, then another dog, so I finally went up and asked how long I could anticipate to sit there waiting on a Sunday afternoon.  The woman couldn't give me an estimate and told me I would have to wait until all of the appointments were seen first.  I, once again, asked to speak with the manager, who does nothing for managing situations whatsoever, and he told me that because they are a separate business, they couldn't do anything about the wait.  Needless to say, I left.  For $56 + $10 in tip, I can find a groomer who will treat my dog correctly and humanely, and I will not have to worry about them coming home injured.  I will never return to Petsmart for grooming, nor will I set foot in this Petsmart for anything again.  There are quite a few other pet stores and groomers in the area and I'm sure their level of service will exceed Petsmart's lack in customer service tenfold."
5,"Okay, I have some explaining to do. My best friend and I are going to an EVENT this weekend to celebrate her birthday. She came up with the awesome idea of getting all crazy and wearing wigs. .....I thought ""FUN"" and wholeheartedly  agreed !!! ........Now she wants me to keep this wig thing a secret so strictly poker face here. 

After reviewing Yelp, I told her I had the perfect place to find some cool wigs. I drove us around the block three times, literally . With this little 1970's wig boutique being on Central Ave , it's not exactly easy to access. 

Finally, I found a  small  alley and pulled in the back. (please see the picture). I knocked on the door with the microscopic signage that says ""Wigs"" and out popped a tiny Asian woman who whisked us inside.

We walked into wig heaven. Every length , every color. I couldn't stop laughing. Rows and rows of wigs. 

I was a little startled at how the owner was so protective of her wigs. She made us sit down and only one person at a time could try one on. She  said "" Are you going to buy a wig today""? I smiled and said NO..........we are going to buy TWO !!!

Although the parking was atrocious ( one star), the service was abrubt and  rushed ( two stars), we ultimately found our perfect wigs for the reasonable price of $35 each the best part,  I'm still cracking up!!! (that's worth five stars in of itself!) Overall, I would rate this shopping experience a  solid five ! 

Have a great weekend ! 

Gaga..........Oh-la-la"
5,"I had taken my terrier here for grooming before he passed away nearly two years ago and finally was ready to get a replacement pup.  My new terrier is about 8 months old now and is a Lori's devotee!  Their staff are all gentle and caring, and her grooming has always been just want I've asked for!  Not only are their staff welcoming and always remember your pup when you come, they also offer doggy daycare!  The doggy daycare is perfect for tiring out a young puppy in a very homey setting (their facility is an old house in downtown Middleton).  My vet advised against one of the larger dog daycares in town due to her smaller size and it being possibly overwhelming, so Lori's is the best of both worlds!!!!  In fact, I'm on my way to pick her up this afternoon from a grooming and play day!"
1,"That old bar smell.

This goes way beyond dive bar.  I commented to my friend about the couple on barstools, 'those two are ""leaving las vegas'!""   

Does any establishment need 40 taped up signs warning the would-be patron of their rules:  ""NO CREDIT CARDS"" --and someone wrote by hand, 'EVER'.  and ""NO GUNS"" and multiple ""NO SMOKING"" 

I ate the burger and I lived, though the meat tasted old I figured it was soooooo overly cooked that I probably was safe.

...Jesus!  I just read the review about them having cooler ""problems""."
5,Another satisfied customer! I was referred to Techniprint about a year ago for a project I wanted to put on canvas and they did wonderful then and now they outshined once more. Blew up 3 prints that I had them scan 2-3 times the original size & print on canvas. They came out absolutely perfect! They look so good that the framers at Michael's asked me where I got them done so here's a referral Techniprint!
1,"Horrible service.  

We went for ""Taco Tuesday.""  We waited for nearly 15 minutes before walking up to the bar to ask if we could get some service.  ""I thought you were helped"" the lady grunted at me as she took our order.  She was the only bar keep in the place.  Must have an Alzheimer's style memory. 

Nearly 10 minutes later our drinks showed up.  We witnessed others get their food that had ordered after we did.  We ordered the taco special, so being ""Taco Tuesday,"" one would think these would be readily available.  

Finally after 1/2 hour, we got our food tossed on the table.  The personable waitress didn't notice our drinks were empty, so I had to walk the glasses to the bar to get them refilled.  While waiting quietly, some Harley- riding local came in and he was greeted like royalty.  He barged right in front of me and he got served pronto. The bar tender went to him like files to a fresh pile of doo.   Thanks.

Looks like the only way you'll get served here is if you are known by the employees, ride a Harley, have more tattoos than stripper convention or poor hygiene.

The food was decent. At  $5.75 for a taco, the price was awesome.  I'd go back if it weren't for the lousy service.  Maybe I should buy  a new Electra-Glide next time I want a taco."
5,"now this place was a godsend... i was really upset that i found this place just a few days before i left madison to come back to cali.  i found it by accident on my way to some random clinic to take a drug test, which i passed, by the way.  

the jerk chicken served with some jamaican style cabbage and their f'in delicious rice and peas, rice and beans to those unfamiliar. i had to get the fried plantains on the side because that's how i roll and if you don't know about dem fried plantains, you better ask somebody... and because i was starving, i ordered two jamaican beef patties on the side.  back on jamrock the beef patties are served tucked into a big ass piece of coco bread.  unfortunately, they didn't have the coco bread here, but it was tasty nonetheless. 

first day there the cashier had somewhat of an attitude.  i later learned that she was only friendly and polite to the white folks.  oh well, the food was fantabulous.  the next day i took my coworkers and we were fortunate enough to be served by another lady with that island love straight from jamrock.  i ordered the jerk salmon... lovely. 

i recommend getting some extra jerk sauce to pour over your rice and peas and whatever entree you get.  also, don't forget the fried plantains!"
5,Stopped here a few times for the yummy baklava. I've eaten lunch here once and it was fabulous. I had the tan-tan chicken and it was amazing! Moist chicken and lovely flavors.
5,"In the hot AZ summer going to Coronado island is a great idea, however if you can't make the commute the Coronado Cafe is a great 2nd choice.

This place has everything you need for a great date.

Quaint and romantic old house setting and patios.
Table cloths and faux candles
Menu full of artfully presented items
Wines by the glass or bottle
Background music in lieu of background noise.

We started our meal with a gargonzola salad, which they did a split plating for us. $6 The greens were fresh the cheese was bountiful and pungent the walnuts were candied and the slices of apple were crisp, what more could you want from a salad?

For our main dishes we had the Cherve Rellnos $12, Two large pablano chilies stuffed with well dices zucchini other veggies and goat cheese on top of a generous pile of polenta and a roasted red pepper sauce, it was amazing.

The other main was miso glazed salmon with sauted spinach and basmati rice. The fish had a nice crisp crust, the spinach had a nice flavor and the rice was well just rice, it could use a veggie in it to to spice it up.

Bottles of wine start at a affordable $12

The meal included bread with olive oil.

Bottom line great romantic place for dinner or lunch."
1,"I used to come here all the time only because they dont have those brushes that beat your car up..so I specifically asked them not to use the hand brush on the front of my car because they go so fast that the handle nicks the corners of my car.. So as I see my car going to the line up what do I see 2 guys using brushes on my car.. So we confronted the lady, and she proceeded to show us how soft the brush bristles are..not my point..but they were nice enough to comp us the wash..then the guy wiping down our car, was worthless.. From now on I'm washing my car at home.. what happened los olivos?"
5,"I used to go here once every two weeks for lunch with my coworkers.

It's extremely delicious Thai food, if slightly difficult to get a table if you are a group of 8 or more (understandable...) Pad thai + curries are excellent. Ambiance = extrememly fun. Hot sauce and peppers = extrememly available.

The drinks here are HIGHLY recommended. Lychee + Gin Martinis. YES YES YES YES YES. I'm not sure why I havent started making this at home. 

I had my union going away party here on the patio. So awesome in the fall and winter!

Oh also the staff is awesome. Not only are the waitresses EXTREMELY attractive but also very nice and always remembered our big gang of fools."
5,"The best. I've had at least half the menu and everything is consistently excellent. Crab puffs are super filling and on point, gyoza is perfect, spring rolls rule. The panko fish is my go to; perfectly crisp, fresh and delicious every time. The chicken, whether in teriyaki or panko form, has a wonderful grilled flavor. Not to mention how affordable the prices are for what you're getting, this place is amazing. Service is always efficient and extremely friendly."
5,"I found Deli Roma too late.  Fortunately, I was able to enjoy the godfather part I several times this winter before it closed.  This was my favorite sandwich, anywhere, ever, period.  Sad to see you go, thank you for the delicious food!"
1,"My first LGA experience...won't be back unless someone begs me. Omelette was served cold, too busy to care what the plate looked like and no silverware clean. The place was packed. Why?"
1,Ridiculous expensive drink prices...$16 for a double tall vodka soda. The manager is an A$$. Flip side...cute cocktail waitresses.
1,Met some friends here last night with high expectations due to good reviews. We had a party of 10 so we made sure we were there right when they opened at 5pm. They sat us immediately but when  we asked them up front (before we ordered) to split the checks they had a bit of an attitude. We made it a game to get them to lighten up. Which they did! A for effort on the waitresses part. We had her laughing and smiling.  I should mention here that when we walked in it smelled fishy as well. Not a good sign for a sushi place. This should have been our second red flag. Food came fairly quickly. It was ok nothing special and a bit overpriced for what you get. Towards the end they started to rush to get us out which we would have gladly done 30 minutes prior if they would bring our checks. By the time we got home I was extremely sick and that was how the rest of my night went! I am not new to sushi. In fact its my fav! I would NEVER go back to this place. The only reason its getting 1 star is because the waitress was a hoot!
5,"I've never had a bad meal here. Pasta is always perfect, the pizza is wonderful and the calzones are huge and excellent. I had my rehearsal dinner here for a pizza party and it was TOP NOTCH. I'm still getting comments about how good the pizza was. The service for that large party and whenever its just the hubby and I has always been great. DO NOT miss the Tiramisu here!"
1,Mexican pizza was extremely gross. Made me sick. Tasted like it was old and reheated 10 or 15 times before I got it. Lady at front gave a a dirty look when I asked for something else. Just keep on driving.
1,"The care we received was substandard.  My mother in law was recovering from heart surgery and not doing well. We noticed something was wrong but the nurses kept insisting everything was ok. It turned out she had a UTI that went unnoticed we requested a test for the UTI otherwise it would have never been found until it may have been too late to reverse. 

Then she was given Seroquel to have her calm down against our wishes. This was a psychotropic drug that was unnecessary.

The neighborhood is also not safe and the Valet service closes at 10:00 PM 

We needed to be there for the entire stay ( 24/7 ) to insure she got the care she needed.  She was also dehydrated and the nurses did nothing until we insisted something was done,

The attending doctor was annoyed if we made any suggestions and it wasn't until our cardiologist came in and gave specific instructions that anything got done,

Terrible care, I would not have even given this hospital one star if it wasn't required by Yelp."
5,Great bar for Packer games. Free shots for touchdowns. Pot Luck on Packer sunday. Bring a dish to pass.
5,"If you could imagine going over to your friend's place for dinner if your friend is a chef?  That is the Welcome Diner.

Every time I have been there, the place was full of laughter and the smell of great food cooking.  If you sit at the counter, you could smack the chef on the ass.  Order a hurricane, and everyone in the joint yells, ""HURRICANE!""  

It is a great time.  My only complaint?  They aren't open enough hours to totally clog my arteries."
5,"I can see why this place has such high ratings.  The staff were really nice, the service was outstanding.  I didn't find it slow at all, especially since what you are waiting for is fresh food.  The interior was spacious.  There were gentlemen playing guitars in the corner. The prices were good, particularly considering how much food you get.  I ended up taking more than half of my food home.  
The food was delicious!  The two kinds of salsa were both fresh and delicious.  The red was my favorite of the two because of its smoky flavor.  They make their chips on the spot when you order them, so they were hot and crunchy.  I ordered the machaca. I had never had it before and it was phenomenal.  I also ordered the green chile, which I expected to be spicier since it had an * warning, but I could have handled a little more heat to the dish.  I can only imagine what they put in the refried beans to make them so good, my arteries probably should not inquire.  They serve homemade tortillas, hot and fresh.  They can bury me in one like a shroud one day.  
I will definitely go back to try other things."
1,"Epic Failure!

Went for lunch with a coworker. Sat for nearly 10 minutes without a waiter/waitress coming to our table. We watched people who arrived after us get their drink orders taken and delivered during that same time period. 

The only time when we thought our waiter discovered us is when we got up to leave for a different restaurant. Someone was chasing after us as we walked to the elevator.

The hostess was equally clueless. She apparently didn't recognize us as the people she brought to a table only moments ago and asked if we enjoyed our lunch.

The place was only a third full at most. No reason for the extremely poor service.

Can't wait until Sliders opens for the season!

This TGI Fridays is an epic failure!"
5,"Had been going to Cali Nails and quit going for a number of reasons, but gave it another try because it is one of theonly places for nails in Central Phoenix with more than one tech on duty. Much to my surprise it is under new management although still owned by Rose. Jimmy is first rate, and really does stellar work, including 3_D nails. Bald Jimmy does nail art that looks exactly like the stickers but actually stays on. They can duplicate most anything you find on the internet. Really sharp stuff. They don't upsell or overcharge, or $5 you to death. Love being able to come back to the shop with the new fresh makeover as well. Well done!"
5,"Great neighborhood gem! Friendly staff, fresh deli, groceries, produce, smokin deals on liqour and beer."
5,"I've been going here for many years, Bill the original owner gave great cuts and the new owner Todd does a great job too... You won't be disappointed"
5,"The perfect place for the near-east side. Good to very good drinks (depending on the bar tender) and yummy pub food -- especially the walnut burger. It has a workaday feel, with a side of liberal politics and an accepting and welcoming attitude. Somehow it's not overpopulated with posers which makes it just about my favorite place in town."
5,"I've been coming to this place since I moved to the valley. They've always done a great job cleaning my car. I love the complete works wash. Affordable and thorough!

Today was extra special because they're celebrating their 25 year anniversary and giving out free car washes to every 25th patron. Guess who scored? Felt like a total douchesquid though for being on the phone when I rolled up in the line. Whoops! Thanks for the wash though! My little car thanks you too!"
1,"Gonna wait next time a mcflurry craving hits... My mcflurry looked like there was only one Oreo mixed in and half of it was outside the cup. 

Got hounded for change coming and going, then a fight broke out in the Parking lot as we were leaving. Gotta remember not to return here ever! Yeesh! :-/"
1,"There are so many reasons this place is a failure, even though I am so so thankful for the existence (though not the idiotic design and planning) of the AMC 24 here.  Full of 2nd-rate restaurants and trinket shops, it just doesn't have much draw.  (Sam's Cafe is really the only restaurant here that I go to much.)

Rather than putting the theater (blank walls) in the center with the shops and restaurants around it to create a vibrant urban space, they killed the street-facing ability of much of this block by turning it outside-in and into a little suburban ""enter me and leave the city"" area.   You combine that with the concept of 2nd floor retail (again a suburban mall concept), and this place is a complete failure.  Notice nothing exists on the 2nd floor.  Even if it had 3x the foot-traffic nothing could survive up there, because no one would ever see anything on a 2nd floor in-passing on their way to something else and thereby never ""discover"" it.  Whoever conceived and built this ""Center"" should be tarred, feathered, and forced to live in Anthem.

Actually, judging by the design, they probably do live in Anthem."
1,"Pre-purchased a wax for $89 with paperwork indicating full wax job, clay and etc.   I came back a month later to have car waxed, sales or detailing manager told me that I only bought to only have left side of door waxed and tried to sell me another wax which I already bought and clearly indicated on paperwork Finally, they realized i was aware of scheme and said would wax the entire car.   However, to find out an hour later , my car was not waxed but just sprayed with a liquid shine on certain area of car.    Because, my car was new and expensive, I didn't want to argue to have it done right and risk them harming my paint.  The next day, I waxed the car myself, which you can clearly teell the difference of car that has been waxed.   Don't pre-purchase services from this place and do not use them as they are dishonest!"
1,"UGH. I ate here for my last night after spending my whole summer in Phoenix/Scottsdale and it was perhaps the worst decision (and my least favorite place I ate at over the entire summer)! I was thoroughly bummed with my dining experience after hearing constantly how Zen 32 was supposedly ""the hip"" place. I was completely unimpressed with the hostesses and the service (which was slow, rude, and totally unhelpful), the food was disappointing (not fresh, not tasty, not innovative), and the ambiance was definitely not what it was built up to be. We ordered a variety of entrees and sushi rolls, both of which were completely inauthentic Japanese and nothing special in terms of preparation or ingredients. I would have rather eaten at PF Changs or Roys, where I would be spared the pretentiousness. Also, the place is crowded. Not in a good, social lounge scene way. In a nasty, don't have enough room to eat/breathe way. For some reason word of mouth has gotten out that Zen 32 is THE sushi place, but spare yourself the tasteless reality. Seriously, it's not that chic. Unless you're really dying for sushi at midnight, you're better off next door at Delux."
5,"The furniture and art in Red is amazing, but damn, if I could only afford some of it.  Although I know the owners/sellers/docents can see it in my dead eyes that I am only the transient type who enjoys looking at beautiful things that my graduate degrees' debts will prevent me from purchasing, they have always been friendly and helpful to me when I have browsed around this temple to vintage teak and sleek plastic.

Okay, so my only hang-up with Red is that a lot of neat stuff does not have price tags; who knows, maybe I could afford some stuff if I knew what the price was...still, probably not...yet."
5,"First things first: the house BBQ sauce is fabulous. I love that it isn't just the regular brown house made goop that most BBQ joints serve. You can actually see and taste all the different spices/herbs!! Like I said, fabulous. 

I went with the smoked chopped pork shoulder sandwich platter and two sides: the potato salad and the corn. If you (like me) choose to order the corn to ease your conscience (after all, it is a vegetable, right?)...do not be fooled. The corn is puuuure buttery goodness. The potato salad is also delicious! Truly, the perfect complement to the sandwich. Creamy, no skin, no dill, just the way I like my potato salads. :9

At $8.45, the sandwich platters are very reasonably priced for the quantity of food you get. The takeout service is super quick as well - I think I got my food within 2-3 minutes of placing my order. Otherwise, Smoky Jon's seems like a fun place to dine in as well (lots of exposed wooden paneling and checkered tablecloths). You'll probably want to limit your party to a group of 4 or less though, the seating is limited!

Yelp recommendations for what to order as a first-timer to Smoky Jon's are on point. I can't wait to be back to try the ribs!!

Tip: their parking lot is tiny and shared with the bar next door, so don't expect to find any open spaces around lunch or dinner time. You'll have better luck parking on one of the residential streets behind the joint."
5,"I took my sisters and some other girls here for my sisters unofficial last girls day/night out before she tied the knot. We took a Tru Limo Lincoln Navigator out so we could sip on some drinks through our day, and Cali nails let us continue the party during our mani-pedis! It was awesome! When I was initially looking for a nail salon every place that wasn't a fancy $$$ spa turned me down because they couldn't accommodate all of us, but Cali took care of us! As soon as we came in we all took our chairs and soaked our feet in a nice warm bath. They have a large selection of shellac gel polish and regular ones too! Everyone found one they liked immediately.  My sister went with the french tip for her wedding and it looked great! They had everyone's pedicures going and transitioned to manicures reasonably fast. We all had the massage chairs going while chatting it up. The staff was all nice, it was a bit out of the ordinary for some of the techs to be men in their 20's or early 30's who spoke perfect English, but they do a great job and made for easy conversation! Some of us were stupid and wore skinny jeans and boots but they had us covered with these disposable flip-flops! I was like wuuuuhhh? That's service! Overall, it was a wonderful experience and they seem pretty busy, so I would say making a reservation was a good choice. It's really close to my sisters house so I may be back for more in the near future!"
1,"A group of us went there for the cafe and let the kids looks at the books.  I am just going to review the cafe.  We were all reviewing the menu, I have not been there in a LONG time.  She was very annoyed that we did not know what we wanted.  CHILL!  I ordered a medium green tea latte.  She was very rude and loud, DO YOU HAVE A BORDER'S CARD?  She prepared my drink.  It was so hot, I had to wait 5 full mins before drinking it.  When I picked the cup also thought it was very light.  The cup was only 3/4 filled? WTF?  The drink was good but the service and quantity in the cup was a totally disappointment."
5,"I love this place, have been going to ""Poppas"" for years, started back when they were on the corner of Milwaukee and Stoughton. Best place to get Dogs and Gyros.  The building may be run down, the booths maybe hard plastic, but the Gyros and Chicago dogs are worth the trip for a great lunch!"
5,"Went here with a couple of friends after work one night.  We 'd been looking for a good BBQ place in Madison, and Smoky Jon's was the first place we tried.  Needless to say, we won't be trying any place else!

The first thing that struck me was the great atmosphere in the restaurant.  It's a small place, maybe 15 tables total, and there's blues music playing in the background.  We put our order in at the front window and then grabbed a couple of tables.  We grabbed a couple of tables and didn't have to wait very long before our food was brought out.

Oh was the food good.  I ordered a 1/3 slab of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich combo platter.  The pork was piled on it's bun in plentiful quantities.  It was pretty good, the pork had good flavor and my only complaint is that it wasn't quite as tender and juicy as some of the homemade stuff I've had.  The ribs, though, were amazing.  The meat was incredibly tender.  More importantly, though, was that there was a lot of meat on each bone.  I'm used to seeing skimpy ribs get served at restaurants where you're left wanting more after a full rack.  Here, in just 4 bones I found I was very full.  Smoky Jon's sauce was a great compliment to the meat as well.  Good full flavor with a nice little kick at the end.

The sides were equally excellent.  The baked beans are a must, and I saved mine for the end so that's the flavor I would leave with.  I also had the sugar fried biscuits that were pretty good too.

The highlight of the meal, though, was something one of my friends had ordered.  The restaurant also had chili available (which may just be a seasonal item).  It was served with a fork rather than a spoon, and with good reason.  I've never seen chili that was that thick and meaty.  I was able to get a taste of it and was floored by how great the flavors were.  It was so good that I almost went back up to order some chili to go for the next day.

Smoky Jon's is a must for BBQ fans in Madison.  The prices are good, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is perfect.  We will be going back sooner rather than later."
5,"Life is good when a place as amazing as this is right off the light rail line that you can walk to from your house (and I can). I have been meaning to go for ages and finally a group of friends wanted to go out of dinner, two of them which now live downtown, and I recommended Cheuvront. A half hour ride from the Mill Avenue stop and I was there. 

A bit chilly to sit outside but looks like excellent outdoor seating. The seating is well spaced with wine storage along the back wall and a well stocked bar in the middle (God and I both love a well-stocked bar, or at least I always say ""Thank God, they have a bar). The wait staff was cordial without being too personal (I look at dining as I'm out to eat dinner with friends, not really out to make new friends, at least until I have a few drinks but that is whole different situation....ahem). 

I started out the evening with a basic mojito made with 10 cane rum. A little too much sugar syrup for my taste and could use more lime but wow, served in a full size glass and a kick like a mule. One of my fellow diners had the white sangria with fresh basil and wow, that was a keeper. I'm definitely having that next time. 

They have a huge selection of cheeses from around the world and we ordered the three cheese appetizer plate (the waiter asked if I wanted to pick but was happy to pick a selection for us, and I love to delegate) and the pork empanadas with orange marmalade. The cheese was good and I noticed they also have another book where you can order wine and they just pair it with cheese, how cool! The empanadas, to die for, I will order that again, ideally along with that sangria with fresh basil. 

Dinner was the duck breast rubbed with coffee and ancho chili pepper and served on top of I don't know what but it had a crispy grilled crust on the outside and it was nice and cheesy (seemed like some sort of rice and cheese mix) on the inside, and it was wonderfully presented. I actually had the recommended wine pairing and wow, it went so well together. A rich red wine that offset the spice rub on the duck breast perfectly. 

We ended the evening with coffee and desert. The coffee was okay but they should consider serving coffee roasted at the Cartel coffee lab in Tempe (which I love) as the coffee here was just...coffee...which was a shame when the rest of the meal was so great. Ideally they should bring everyone an individual french press so they can let the coffee get as strong as they like to drink it. I would also recommend a thicker cream, even whipping cream (unwhipped) since it provides that sense of luxury that goes well with this place (I had that at Mucho-Gusto and became an instant fan). 

For those of the more intellectual persuasion, I noticed this place is in walking distance of the main Phoenix library. So you can go pick out a good book on a lazy Sunday and then walk over to Cheuvront for some wine and cheese and feel like the perfect elitist, before you ride the light rail home (okay, this is my ideal lazy Sunday and I've always dreamed of being just a little bit of an elitist - I'm not perfect)."
5,The refried beans are better than chocolate!  Worth the drive!
1,"Pros: Easy to find, reasonable prices, close to my home, always has available parking

Cons: I used to come here because it was the closest to my home. I just had to stop. They messed up my clothes 30% of the time, but I still kept coming. However, they absolutely destroyed a pair of pants I brought in one time. When I tried to bring it to their attention, they argued that it was the way I washed the pants. I had not even worn the pants or washed them."
5,"MERCADO DEL PARAISO. That is not my review, but rather what is written on the side of the Ranch Market building. After reading other reviews of this place, I already had a feeling it was going to be good...but the Paradise Market...hmmm... Made me ask myself what my idea of a paradise market would be. ( In case you were wondering, it would include Gael Garcia Bernal, Alejandro Fernandez, Juanes and other latinos guapos pushing shopping carts... shirtless.)

Anyway...focus!...Walking in from the parking lot, I could already hear lively music spilling out of the store. My blood started to sizzle with excitement. Then, right after crossing the threshold, I beheld a thing of dazzling beauty- carts and carts of aromatic and fresh pan dulce. I knew this place and I were just beginning a long and promising relationship. 

My roommate and I wandered around the pan dulce display cases, salivating, pointing, giggling. We opted not to purchase as we have way too many holiday sweets left over as it is. We continued on to the jugeria where I had the best horchata I have had in a long, long time. Too much of the time horchata is watery. The Ranch Market horchata was so flavorful and creamy. I drank it just like a little kid who doesn't even let the straw leave their mouth for a moment. 

We then wandered throughout the whole store. I know I probably looked awe-struck because it is overwhelming. It is bustling and frenetic and packed full of food treats, smells, conversation...LIFE. Be sure to pass by the tortilleria and take in the smell of freshly cooked tortillas. Also, don't miss the meats! Chicken feet! Tongue!  Tripas! Oh yeah! AWESOME! 

Who the hell would ever want to go to a Safeway again when shopping can be this entertaining?

I'll be sure to go back soon for some pan dulce, a raspado or some lunch. More than anything, I'll go back for the experience because that's what this place is- a cultural experience."
5,"For those that haven't heard, Payton Curry has taken over Welcome Diner April through May on Sun, Mon, Tues, and First Fridays. Get there... now. Payton is known for pushing limits and incorporating fresh, local ingredients. The menu will likely change every week, if not every night, so I'm not sure if my recap will help all that much, but here goes.

The neighborhood is sketchy, the place is tiny, and the accommodations are ""rustic"", so if you're all into the Scottsdale scene or flashing your dough, don't bother. That being said, Shantal mentioned that being there made her feel like she was camping every night, and I have to admit the evening had a vacation feel to it... National Lampoon's style!

You can instantly tell that Payton is having a blast and it shows on his face and in the food. We were seated on a collection of old dining chairs at a makeshift table of 2x8s and construction horses in the middle of the front yard, with a candle to light our way... I knew it was going to be a sweet evening!

We started with the burrata that was lightly seasoned with truffle oil and cracked pepper. Unfortunately a lot of people are adding burrata to their menus and they have no idea that this fresh, creamy, delicate version is how it's truly meant to be. It was served with slices of toast that I expected to be the brick-hard version to which I've become accustomed. Imagine my surprise as I bit into a spongy, buttery slice of bread with just a crunch of the crust! Delicious.

The porcini foie gras terrine will scare those faint of heart, but it's amazing and the pear butter adds this velvety, sweet flavor that just makes it unforgettable. I wasn't a fan of the pate', but it was a combination of pickle, horseradish, and mustard flavors with chunks in the loaf... all things I can personally only handle in moderation individually and generally dislike, so it was exactly as described. The mains arrived and the Sonoma lamb sugo proved to be an interesting choice. It's not something you would eat on a regular basis, but I'm so glad I got to try it. The shreds of lamb meat were piled on top of a bowl of hearty fettuccine with perfectly cooked chickpeas and dollops of cream that muted any gaminess of the meat. Then you would get a bite of golden raisin to kick in a touch of sweetness; pretty cool combination of flavors and textures without being over the top.

Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night was the bowl of Bolognese that was planted in front of us, it blew me away and I have no idea why!! Payton, what's your secret with something so simple? Dessert followed with apple pie that could've been much tastier if it were warmed with a scoop of ice cream, but all was rescued with a huge chunk of bread pudding that puts my mother's recipe to shame (and it was served warmed with a scoop of ice cream :). 

All in all, we had a wonderful night with fabulous food and fun friends and we didn't want the night to end. If you want a hint of adventure, get to Welcome Diner before the end of May... seriously... National Lampoon's style.

ps: It's BYOB!"
1,If this is a place to help people it is a poor excuse. Judges of the county court say probation officers will help you and that is because they are not under oath. Everyones eyes that work there pass judgement on you. They don't care about you or your situation. I couldn't tell the people that work there from the people that are ordered to go there. The receptionist(if that is here title) was completely rude to people as if they are supposed to know what to do. The information paper that is to inform you about things to stay away from as far as incidental exposure to certain types of alcohol that could contaminate your u.a. Is poorly informed. Phone tag is a number one priority and when you do get to talk  to someone they always seem to have something better to do. I can't believe the frame of mind that the government allows these people to represent them. Sanitation is lacking in a big way. They expect you to be on time yet they can't open their doors on time. Practice what you preach and understand not all people that are there are actually guilty. And how is it that people that have d.u.i. And get breathalyzers can still go out and drink and get by the system and still drink. yet marijuana offenders can't have a beer once and awhile. Last time I checked d.u.i. Killed more people than stoners. Nice to know the system works. Waste of time and of course the money. They don't care. End of story. Oh and one more thing. The hours that they are operate do not make sense. Why would have people start testing in midday. Don't you think most people either work early morning till five and or start a midday shift till late at night. 11 to 9? Really?Really? So they are there to help but only when it's convenient  for those who work there. Come on people. Being in that program would make anyone want to do drugs
1,"The drinks are so weak here that I had to order a vodka shot to put in my vodka martini and a whiskey shot to put in my whiskey sour. It tasted like water before. Any liquor drinks taste like watered down juice. And they aren't cheap drinks, so that's ridiculous. The food is good though."
1,"This place SUCKS....Stay away!  The 7th St location is a scam shack.  I went in for ""just break pads"" & they found $1,500 worth of things to fix. As I left quickly w/ no work done I had a new scrape, scrape sound every tire rotation. I took my Tundra to a real mechanic & he said everything is fine for quite a few more miles.  But that funny new sound???  It was due to the ""Just Brakes"" boys taking a crow bar (or some other tool) to the inside of the wheel  & pinching a spot down  so it rubbed on the drum.  They must think I'm dumb enough to turn right around after a couple blocks & have them fix an emergency they just created.  Give ME a break!"
5,"B.E.S.T. brunch in Madison. 
Brunch at airport  - ""huh"" right? Right.

The restaurant is located with in the Wisconsin Aviation building, which is across the field from where the commercial flights are housed.  You can eat the fantastic food while plane watch for your pleasure. If you haven't been here already, you're missing out - A. Lot. 

The airy pancakes that I ordered were fluffy, and really the best I've had in Madison. It sounds like a ""guilty pleasure,"" but the pancakes are truly airy that it doesn't feel heavy on the stomach after clearing the plate. The three eggs omelet was equally spectacular. Plus the solid cordial service seals the 5-stars deal.

The scene is a clean diner, but as my friend put it, ""it's an actual diner with good food, and not like the other wanna-bes."" Absolutely correct. And there's no need to do too much flare on the decor when they got the fantastic view of the private planes against the blue sky. I will be back for more for sure! Maybe a sunset dinner for the next time?"
1,"I ordered a dozen garlic Parmesan wings and a order of fried zucchini. Although they weren't the worst wings I've had, they definitely were no where close to being the best. The wings were cold, probably due to the gallon of wet sauce they were covered in. The zucchini was burnt. I was skeptical pulling into the parking lot because it looked like a carnival. Let me just say it looked the same way inside. The dining room was covered in carnival toys and looked like they haven't dusted in years. They had hand made menus all over the place. We also had a homeless visitor come in to our table and ask for money so he could eat. One word for this place YUK!"
5,"The inferno is never disappointing! From seeing A23 a few years back to Aesthetic Perfection just recently. They have Ac, a great stage, a really quant sitting lounge area and 2 bars. The place is very stylish with great color scheme. The bartenders are very knowledgeable on drinks and friendly and quick. The prices are moderate for drinks. Easy to get to. Easy parking. It seemed very friendly and inviting both times. To bad the inferno isnt in my neighborhood! :)"
5,"Hash was a smash for me. Also Tim the owner sang us a Dylan song. Great biscuits, also liked the potatoes. It is a must try if you are in Mad-town."
1,"Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best, and their ""schmears"" appear to be highly processed.  I've generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive, as has the service.  I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry, and wanted a bagel (they're supposed be a bagel store after all!).  First, no salt bagels.  Aren't salt bagels one of the standards?  Second, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese (cream cheese being a $1.50 option) to go and that was my real mistake.  Whoever made the bagel didn't even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on one-half of the bagel.  The other half was basically dry.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel.  Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans - they have much better bagels, and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you."
5,"First time today!  What was I thinking and why did I wait so long to head down here?  Seriously, $16.99 (with coupon) for a hand wash of SUV, glass cleaned, mats cleaned, vacuum and tire dressing!  It was busy, hot and the wait was long, but totally worth it!  I usually wash and detail my vehicles myself, but just couldn't get to it this weekend.  Anytime I can't wash my own vehicles, I'm bringing them to Los Olivos.  And, the employees are so nice...bonus!"
1,"Very disappointed! Ordered delivery, food was cold and bland.  Worst general TSO chicken ever tasted."
5,"We really had a great time here,
We were celebrating our oldest foster daughters 8th birthday. So my wife, our two foster kids, and myself met our daughter and her boyfriend here. We had a 6:30 reservation, we were actually there early. This is were I had the only problem of the evening. When we first arrived, I told them who I was and we are early. The hostess said that we were going to need to wait for our reservation time. While I was in shock, I asked her. So if we just walked in now and asked for a table, we would be seated now? This is when she said one moment so she can talked to her supervisor. She sat us when she came back and apologized. I told her there was no apology needed. She asked us if we needed them to keep the birthday cake Denise baked in storage which was very helpful.
Natalie the birthday girl was in awe on the decor of the restaurant and very excited that we ate in the trolley. I ordered the gluten free baked chicken and pasta. It was better then I thought it was going to be. At my age, I am trying healthier food options. Although the chicken was a little dry, pasta was very good. The two girls had spaghetti and meat sauce and had no complaints from them. Not going into detail on what everyone else had, but there was no complaints from them either. When we were finished, they came out with the cake, ice cream, and sang Natalie the birthday song. I believe this is going to be a great memory for her. I know that Natalie never had the chance to experience things like this. Something that myself and very many people take for granted! 

The food here is good, I have had better. 
The service here was great, even with the little issue.
The reason why I gave this place the 5-star, because it gave Natalie a time of her life!"
1,"I tried to order to go from this place. The phone rang and rang and rang, when someone finally did pick up they put me on hold until the line disconnected. I called back and had the exact same thing happen. We figured they were just busy and decided to drive there to get to go. There was only ONE car in the parking lot. And the place looked like a total dump, like cockroaches in the kitchen dump. 

Forget this place. There is no excuse for not taking a phone order when there is no one in your restaurant."
5,"We have been caking it up with fancy cakes from Carl since 2009.  The quality of his cakes are absolutely superior.  The prices are a bit high but since you are getting the best cake in the Madison metro area, I suppose he kind of gets to determine the market since he has no real competition.  The only negative I have is that my daughter's birthday is in mid June and the city of Sun Prairie shuts down all the streets around the store location for some stupid street festival.  Generally I have to park about seven blocks away, usually illegally, and lug two giant cakes back to the car.  But I won't downgrade Carl for that.  City of Sun Prairie on the other hand, gets 2 stars our of 5."
5,"It's Target, how can you go wrong?!?

I have never had any complaints with this location. It's clean, convenient, and has an ok grocery section. The check-out lines can be a bit long, but they seem to be good about calling for extra cashiers when it's really busy.

The one time we were looking for something and they didn't have enough of them in stock, they called the nearby Sun Prairie location and arranged it so that our order was waiting at that store when we arrived to purchase it. Very satisfied!"
5,"As others have already stated, I am rating this for what it is...a bar and grill, not a fancy 5-Diamond restaurant.

I chose the bacon cheese burger with grilled onions and some french fries; absolutely delicious!  The burger is juicy and tasty...I add some ketchup and mustard for good measure!  I sat in the bar area and had no problem getting service.  The bartender is quick and attentive; the place was packed and one bartender had the bar crowd and the sitting area crowd.  I also ordered a Capital Winter on tap and it was poured perfectly!

I have been in the area for three years and I consistently return to the Village Green as the best burger in the area.  I like the simplicity of the burger and bun.  The meat is delicious and the bacon adds that extra umph!!!!  Also they have nightly specials and I try to target Tuesday (Sloppy Joes) and Thursday (Road Kill Burrito)...both are great!

Quick, consistent service, very tasty food and a friendly atmosphere; you cannot go wrong."
1,"The service for a group of nine on a thursday night was not only below average, but I have had nicer waiters, better food, and faster service from a McDonald's. The waiter was rude, they over salted all the food, and it was not worth the two for twenty deal that they offer at all."
1,"I ordered three trees to planted by the Bruce company early summer.  I was told they wouldn't be able to get to it until early September.  What?, well, ok I'll wait because they have nice nursery stock.   I called mid September when they still hadn't planted the trees and I was given a date of Sept. 25.  Not to my surprise, no one showed.  I called and they said everything was delayed due to the rain.  It hadn't rained for weeks, but they would be there next Tuesday.  Tuesday has come and gone and no trees.  I called and cancelled my tree order and asked for my 50% , $500 deposit back.  It is now too late for trees to be planted and established by winter.  I am waiting to hear back from them.  I will give an update later on as to whether I get my deposit back!  I have had trouble in the past with them not showing up for a job..no call ..nothing.  I should have learned my lesson then!"
1,"So 1 hour before closing the chairs were already up and the soda machine was already off. I ordered a tuna sandwich and went back home. I have to say that this was the most disgusting sandwich I have ever had. The bread was stale and the tuna was so salty, I ended up drinking a gallon of water. I just threw the sandwich away."
1,"Gross! I generally love Papa Johns, but this one is lacking in all areas. I ordered PJs for lunch and once it finally arrived (1 hour later), it was luke warm and soggy. Apart from that, the staff lacks any work ethic or customer service. The three people I dealt with were all rude and careless. Initially, they ended up giving me a $5 credit. Ha! As if I would order again anyway."
1,"I was here with friends for drinks and dinner last Thursday evening, and I have to say that nothing about this restaurant was acceptable for any of us.

First, we didn't have reservations and were greeted with slightly rude service by the host.  However, I think she noticed that we were a little taken aback by the attitude, and quickly changed her mood.

In the downstairs bar, we ordered drinks while we waited for a table to open up for us.  The bartender made a mistake while preparing my friend's Bloody Mary, accidentally dumping an enormous amount of tabasco in her drink.  However instead of simply making a new one, he served it to her anyway (admitting his mistake while setting it down in front of her) and told her to let him know if she didn't like it and wanted a new one.  Of course she tried it, couldn't drink it and had to ask for a new one.

After we got to our table upstairs and ordered our appetizers and meals, things got worse.  It took well over half an hour to get our appetizers, and when we did they were cold.  We were not sure that our oysters were supposed to be as cold as they were, but the fact that they had congealed melted cheese seemed to indicate that they should haver at least been warm.

After we finally got our salads (about 45 minutes after ordering), we were rushed through them before getting our meals just a couple minutes later.  None of us enjoyed our meals, as we found them either burnt or bland.

Even though we made a few complaints about our meal to the server, when our check came we found that we had been charged for everything and were only offered a very pallid apology for the obvious problems with our meal.

this was not an inexpensive meal, either, so we will likely not be back!"
1,"This is a must read! Ok, food was actually good, but one star for one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had.  I read all the yelp reviews and wanted to give this place a chance, so I did and won't do it again. Please, please, please don't go here. I called in an order to pick up, the guy couldn't understand me and said 5-7 minutes. Drove over there, clarified my order (which he had wrong) and waited. Apparently they were short staffed so the ""waitress"" was doing a delivery. After waiting 10-15 more minutes I gave him a credit card, he said he didn't know how to work the machine, so I patiently waited for the ""waitress"" aka delivery lady to come back.   This is where it gets good, she charges me a wrong amount, less, but I didn't notice and just wanted to get out of there. So I generously tip them out of guilt and then get a call from them asking for my credit card because she didn't charge me for everything. I explained I wasn't driving back there, she asked for my CC over the phone and refused. I felt their service was horrible and it was their mistake. Had I not wasted 20+ minutes there (as my food got cold) I would have not been so stubborn. Bottom line- don't do it! Money is too precious to waste on places like this."
5,"My new favorite bar in Phoenix! Dress anywhere from Casual to Fancy and you fit in. Two step, hip hop, slow dancing, line dancing. They have everything. 

The bar tenders are incredible and take care of you well! TIP EM BIG!!"
5,"In Madison to watch some club soccer at the park down the road. Skipped breakfast and needed to fill my belly with some lip lickin food that comes fast. 

Michael's looked like a gimmick, but was the closest place I could find. They're going for a 50s nostalgia drive-thru and for the most part it works! I recommend going inside to also taste the retro ambiance. 

Food? Happy to report significantly better than your average fast food joint. My bacon cheeseburger was dripping with just off the grill grease. It's a quality burger with fresh veggies to boot. And you won't find fries like this even at a sitdown restaurant. Holy delicious.

Next time I'll try the shake."
5,Nice altering work. Same guy working 15 hours a day. Always delivers on time and very friendly.
5,"I would move closer to this place if it was an option. I have enjoyed, more than I can say, everything I've eaten here. 

I had friends in town so ended up going there two mornings in a row. Saturday I had the Veggie Benedict (instead of the meat layer, it's a mix of tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and peppers). I love a good Eggs Benedict and always try the different versions, but this is the best ever. 

Sunday I went back to my old friend, the greek omelette, and it was as good as ever. We sat in a booth on Saturday and then at the counter on Sunday. The coffee was hot and constantly being topped-up."
1,I'm Sorry to say..But this store is just Nasty!!
1,"I had a cheese burger here last night. The patty tasted as if it had been heated more than once and possibly had a visit with the microwave, no flavor and chewy.  The service was great and the food came out fast (yay, for microwaves!) but I will never return."
1,"One star is too many for this place. We just went for the first time tonight. Our waitress was slow and lazy. We waited 15minutes before the server ""noticed"" us (she was busy talking to coworkers). We ordered some sushi and spring rolls. The sushi is cheap and skimpy, spring rolls were bland. We ate less than 1/2 the sushi and sat waiting for our server to check on us (still busy talking to coworkers). With no more to drink and sitting, waiting to get help for 1/2 hour, the server finally noticed us glaring at her and came over to see if we wanted anything else. We said ""no"" because nothing was good. She left saying nothing and after 10 minutes just dropped our check at the table. We were comped a good portion of the bill, but no manager came to see us and the waitress never mentioned it. Really all they needed to do is not ignore us and if they would have checked in shortly after we were served, we could have tried something else and maybe saved the meal. We will not be back. 
In summation, the food was poor quality, the service was awful, management is mia. No idea how this place stays open."
5,"Gracias Monica for bringing the International Supper Club here!

From the outside, like Monica said, youre not really sure what youre getting into. Until you get inside and smell the deliciousness.

This place is a bit smaller than I expected, but spacious at the same time. We were seated (smartly) towards the back of the restaurant. Oh the menu. Its a little overwhelming, not in the amount of options but the amount of things that sound delicious! I chose the Chimichanga de Pollo. I was totally prepared to enjoy it, as is but then our waitress suggested that I get it enchilada style. Best. Waitress. Ever. Holy god was that thing good. The chicken was tender, the sauce was so so good, and it had just the right amount of spice. Its a large dish, that was equally good the next day.

I would highly recommend this place for a sit down meal if youre looking for really good, authentic mexican food. And I wish I was still in AZ cuz writing this review has made me hungry for it!"
1,"Honestly, the food is pretty good and the little ""cafe"" is clean, but I still couldn't manage to give it more than one star.

Why? Because I just can't stand  the lady who owns and runs it (and cooks your way-too-overpriced food). She's rude. I work in the building and have eaten there on many desperate occasions. The food is pricey (go to Schlotzky's across the street for better value). And it's really not that good. It tastes ok... nothing special at all though.

She's ALWAYS out of something I want, literally every single time I'm there (no potato salad, no bacon, no ham, no tomatoes). What sort of fresh breakfast/lunch place is out of tomatoes at 9 AM? I like ham on my breakfast burrito (comes with three choices: bacon, ham, or sausage). At 8 AM, how does one run out of both bacon and ham (the sausage is kind of odd, I can't eat it) on a regular basis?

Despite me eating there for the past year on a somewhat consistent basis, paying cash every time, she still has to count EVERY last penny before she will even let me put my zingers in a bag.

Scenario: I see zingers I want, ask how much they are ($1), tell her I'm setting the money right here by the register, and since she's cooking, put 4 quarters neatly stacked right near the register (as she watches me and my 4 quarters like a hawk). Then, she finishes my burrito, puts it in a bag, and I go to put the zingers in the bag as well. BAD IDEA! No! Must go count all 4 quarters before they can even enter that bag to sit alongside the tiny $4 burrito I have already paid for! She honestly acts paranoid that people are trying to steal from her or jip her, even with her regular customers. It's no wonder the place is always empty. If you go, and see more than two other people in there at lunch time, consider it a miracle.

And, it's not just me. I'm always polite, say please and thank you, smile. Never let on that I can't stand this woman at all. Everyone on my floor has the exact same thing to say and will only eat down there when they are really desperate and in a time crunch. Most of the people here would rather run across the street to Burger King (and most of the people around me make enough money to consider Burger King beneath them, so that actually says a lot.) Even more go to the 2700 Tower's little store (read below)... they are always busy (but you can still get in and out fast).

This past visit to Central Cafe, there was a small bowl of little chocolates sitting by the register, half empty. She hasn't had those before, and there was no sign on them to indicate any sort of price. My friend, assuming they were free, took a single one and ate it, to then be informed to cough up a quarter! My friend said ""oh, there's no sign. Everybody has these out for everyone."" No... that did not fly. The lady had to have her quarter. I gave her two dimes and 5 pennies. And she counted every single last penny, slowly (we would not want to miss a penny, would we?)

She will probably know who I am after writing this review, but at this point, I really don't care. I have no intention of ever eating there again. I've decided I won't be that desperate again. I've come to the conclusion I'd rather not eat first.

If you want something super quick nearby, try the 2700 tower's little shop (right by the smoking area, next to the entrance to their parking garage), the next building north of our 2600/Central Cafe Tower. The Asians who run it are always very pleasant, also cook basics (think burger, hot dog, burrito, fresh sandwiches wrapped up, etc), and their prices are really reasonable for on-the-go food. They are more of a mini-Circle-K with a small corner where they make food (more diverse options than Central Cafe), all fresh and all pretty cheap for a downtown Phoenix office building shop. And they don't elaborately count every cent, stare at customers, and treat every patron with suspicion... in fact, they're liberal with the Leave-a-Penny-Take-a-Penny jar. More cramped store, but a much better place to grab something quick and not feel like a thief just for coming in!"
5,"Great food, GREAT service. Highly recommend!"
1,"you couldn't pay me to set foot in this shady place... I tried it a couple of times in 2011 and 2012 and I was surprised that a place like this was still in business, especially given its prime location.  

Service was horrible, we were treated like trespassers by the thug behind the bar.

consider yourself warned."
1,"What a mess of a hotel. I guess that maybe I grew up in an era where the Marriott name meant class and luxury. 
I can't blame Marriott for the fact that the hotel was hosting the Little Miss (Jon Benet) America contest. The hotel was overran with 6 year olds wearing make up and donning skimpy outfits. It's disturbing that Parent's lives are so unfulfilled that they have to dress their children like Cocktail waitresses at a seedy bar. 
The hotel was totally booked. You had ten floors worth of rooms, but yet the hotel only had two elevators. It was pretty annoying to wait 15 minutes every time you wanted to go up to your room. 
And the kicker was on Sunday morning when we wanted to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The hotel had nobody on duty to bus tables, so while it was obvious that the restaurant was half empty, but there was a 15 minute wait to be seated. Of course the hostess acted like an office temp, with a bad attitude. That was a perfect ending to our hell stay at the Marriott-Madison West. I couldn't check out of that hotel fast enough. 
In the future, I would rather stay at a hotel with sticky sheets, that rents it's rooms by the hour than ever stay at a Marriott again."
5,I took my Mini to Bavarian Auto after being at the dealership and having a less than fantastic time there. I absolutely love the mechanics at Bavarian. They had the weird issue on my car - which turned out to be a nail stuck in the ABS - solved within an hour and were completely honest on what dealership recommendations actually needed to be taken care of right away. I have had a few other issues with my car over the past year and have been able to call them and get honest advice right away. I highly recommend this shop to anyone with a Mini or BMW!
1,"This was one of the few times Yelp has led us wrong. Came here because it was close by & had 4 stars. 

I will say the service was perfectly fine. Our server was very friendly & even though it was busy, we were greeted at the door & sat quickly. 

Unfortunately, it was downhill from the point we got our food. We ordered an assortment of rolls & a dish of pad Thai. The sushi choices almost all include cream cheese &/or tempura, which made it difficult to choose a variety without everything tasting similar.

The sushi all tasted fishy. I don't think it was unfresh, but it certainly didn't taste fresh either. It was somewhere in between the two...if that is possible. The presentation wasn't bad either, but the overall experience was tainted by the poor tasting sushi."

5,Great people and awesome food!!
5,"Mallards games are seriously awesome and so inexpensive. Most nights feature some sort of special. I like the ""two beers, two hotdogs and a ticket"" one. Tickets are so cheap, although the prices may change with the opening of the new stadium this summer. You can take your whole family to a game or go with friends for a night of baseball and drinking. The duckblind is the place to go if you're looking to eat and drink a lot! It's all you can eat and drink beer (or soda). And, they actually have good beers, not just the cheap stuff. If you get there early, you can snag a picnic table too. I'm really excited to go to a few games this season."
5,"I absolutely love Perry Monge Salon!  I have been going there since 2004 and it has never disappointed.  The entire staff is friendly and makes you feel right at home.  Marina is amazing with hair...I only wish she could style my hair every morning!  The extra perks beyond an amazing hair cut are the chair massage before your wash and the hand massage during your cut!  I spend 75% of my time in Dallas and 25% of my time in Phoenix, but insist on only having my hair cut at Perry Monge!"
1,"Grease running down my hand. That's a first. Maybe that's appealing to some people, but definitely not me.

Sorry, Pizza Pit staff.

1,"Just one word of advice. 
Make sure your trunk is EMPTY and contains ZERO valuables before you drive your car into Lindstrom's. 
Locking it won't be enough.
I'm just sayin."
5,"I was so stressed out about my taxes - hadnt filed in two years, owed money, moved 3 times and changed jobs twice - it was a mess. By the time I left, I was getting a refund and all my paperwork was organized into clearly labeled folders for me. They're just great."
1,"This location is the sole reason that after 13 years, we are no longer AirTouch/Verizon customers, and will never, ever be again. I went in to upgrade my phones one afternoon only to be accosted by an angry, pimply faced little elf of an employee. He was disrespectful, got in my face, and talked down to me the entire time when all I had wanted was two new phones. When I got sick of his attitude I demanded a manager and he said there wasn't one. As if. He then called security, which is when I REALLY got mad! I began yelling at the top of my lungs when ""magically"" a manager appeared out of the back room to investigate the commotion. The manager sent the kid on a ""walk"" and apologized profusely, saying they've had problems with him before. My question was: WHY THE HELL DOES HE STILL WORK THERE?!?! He asked what he could do to make us happy and I asked for the regional manager's phone number. He provided the regional manager's cellular number, which I promptly called. After explaining what had happened, both managers agreed to cancel our two accounts with no early cancellation fees. Woot."
1,"I like domino's pizza when I just want to have cheap pizza delivered.  This location however is awful.  They have messed up the last 3 orders.  1, the crust was missing its seasoning completely and the cheese was half missing - what?  2. the order arrives well over 30 minutes late and wasn't piping hot like you expect.  When i called to check on my tardy order, the manager Carla was rude and told me ""not to worry about it."" What again?  3. I ordered a hand tossed, to hopefully get the garlicky crust I missed out on previously, and they delivered a pan pizza 10 minutes late.  How does one make the online order THAT wrong?  It prints out.  There are only so many crust options.  Carla was rude this time too - if you mess up okay, but don't make it worse by treating your already frustrated paying customer like crap."
1,"I'd been to Bacchanal several times in years past. It was tons of fun. Good food and an outstanding atmosphere -- belly dancing, live music and the best part -- you can break plates. So, I planned my boyfriend's birthday dinner to be there last night. 

I called 2 weeks ago to make the reservation for 15 people. I called again on Tuesday, Oct. 25 to confirm. They said 'see you then!' 

When my party of 15 arrived to a dark, deserted parking lot, we were perplexed and I was embarrassed. A big pink sign tacked to the door explained:

Sorry we are CLOSED for Problems Forced The Remodeling Oct  25 - 31

Which begs the questions: If the restaurant was already closed on Oct. 25,  why did they confirm my reservation when I called Oct. 25? And why didn't they call me to cancel my reservation? 

I'm seriously disappointed and sad that a place I would once have given 5 stars is now barely worthy of 1."
5,"Best teriyaki chicken in town!

Not sure what it is about the teriyaki sauce but it's perfect! The chicken is always tender and I've never had a bite with fat on it. Even the side salad is great, this coming from a guy who doesn't care for many things green... 

The owners are extremely caring and the food shows their attention to detail!

Well done!"
1,"I've been taking my BMW and Nissan here for about 3 years.  In the past year, business seems to have gone up to the point that they CANNOT MAINTAIN PREVIOUS LEVELS OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED ""MOM AND POP"" CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Maybe the perfect 5 star rating here has something to do with that, causing business to explode.  However, when this happens a business either expands, or customer service declines.  Precision imports does not seem to desire expansion, and their customer service has become inconsistent and disorganized.  

Trust is vital with your mechanic, and Frank/Al broke trust with me in a few areas.  I trusted them up until the past year.  Earlier this year Al diagnosed my Nissan with a ""pinhole oil lead causing oil to pool in the back of my engine, replacement required around $500.  It's a very common problem in this model.""  I have not seen any oil leaking from the Nissan, but they assured me ""just wait it's going to leak.""  

Later this year, the service engine light came on in my BMW.  I trusted that Precision Imports would run appropriate diagnostics.  They did not.  Instead, they insisted that I had ""run my car too low on gas, which caused the light to come on"" and rebuked me not do let the gas run too low in the future.  (I had not recently let my tank get too low, and it had been low in the past but never caused problems with the service engine light). They got the service engine light off, and charged me $45.  

A few days later, the service engine light came back on.  I thought, ok, the problem must be more serious or a new problem.  I brought my car in.  After several days of waiting, I called to a rude response that they were ""extremely busy and just hold on we'll call you when it's ready!""  I let it go, and let a few more days go by.  I called back again, and was returned ""It's been ready come and get your car!""  When I pointed out the poor customer service politely, I was returned with ""Sorry we've been swamped.""

When I came to pick my car up, the reason given as to why the light was on astonished me: ""pinhole oil lead causing oil to pool in the back of my engine, replacement required around $500.  It's a very common problem in this model.""  SAME SUPPOSED ""COMMON"" PROBLEM AS MY NISSAN WORD FOR WORD!  AND, they were unable to switch off my service engine light.  I just stared at him.  My read: FULL OF BS.  I said nothing regarding this diagnosis, paid, and left.

I have googled this problem in both cars, and asked around a little.  Neither is a common problem in either car from what I""ve found.  I was even told they have patch kits for the problem, which was never offered to me as an option.

I should add that I also have had 2 ""underquotes"" on mechanical problems here.  I mean, quoted by phone at one cost, then when I go to pay it was higher.  When I've asked about the higher cost, i feel I was given lines of BS.

WHY DOES A SECOND OPINION MATTER?

The next day I was driving my BMW.  Now call me a jackass for not opening my engine and checking the coolant, but the car was JUST serviced (including oil change, etc) at Precision Imports!  My car started smoking like crazy, and died on busy Bell road.  I was able to get the car into another auto shop.  They found out THE COOLANT WAS EMPTY.  THIS IS WHY THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  The charge was $10.  PROBLEM SOLVED, smooth sailing since.  

I have now taken both cars to 2 different mechanics.  Nothing has been discovered in the area of ""pinhole oil leak"" on either car.

It used to be that Frank always overstated the price a little, went above and beyond with communication, and took care of me.  He came across as an honest old school guy to me.  It's different now.  Frank's more detached.  I get the feeling Frank is eying retirement, and would prefer working on a much much lower volume of cars.  No comment on the younger guy Al.  Earlier this year when I brought my car in Frank said ""make sure you deal with me.""  I didn't make much of it, but this could have indicated some other issue going on at the shop.  I did attempt to deal only with Frank this year, but his availability has been very low and he had to route me to Al and others.

I saw a few guys in the shop with a lot of signs pointing to ""previously convicted felon.""  I'm all about turning it around and 2nd chances, and I realize this can be a staple of many mechanic shops.   But, business is business and I didn't get a good feeling about a few of the newer mechanics in the shop.

I gave them several second chances, and communicated my concerns honestly and appropriately.  But that's it for me.  They lost me as a customer.  I'm hoping that they can turn it around, but for starters they are going to need to lose more customers and reduce the extreme volume or expand to a new location.  

If you're going to use Precision Imports, MAKE SURE THE COST IS DEFINED BEFORE REPAIRS ARE MADE.  ON MAJOR ISSUES GET A SECOND OPINION."
1,"They do not use fresh ingredients, or at least they cook so badly to make it seem that way.

People must have to convince themselves that this place is good because it's the trendy thing to do. But you're better off going elsewhere if you want good Chinese food.

Here's a general tip for you guys: if the place isn't predominantly Asian, leave. That's a definite sign that the quality is sub-par. But if you're white and have never had genuine southern Chinese food, you'll probably just barely choke down your ""food"" and agree with most people that this place is decent."
1,"So I decide to take my daughter here because she loves Houston's. I know they are owned by the same company but have different menu items. When we walk in I ask if there are any choices for kids and the hostess says yes a kids burger and a grilled cheese. Waitress comes over, not genuinely friendly, more like fake friendly. I ask about the kids burger since that's pretty much the only suitable option. She tells me that there's no difference btwn kids and regular burgers. Both $16. Ok I'll pass and order her a California roll. It was 5pc and very different tasting and still had imitation crab but still cost $13. I've never seen a Cali roll cast more than $8. And that's regular price, not $4 happy hour. 
I order the French dip which apparently is prime rib but mine was more fat then meat. Disgusting...had to return it. The only good part of the lunch was our appetizer, spinach dip. It's always a win. The mgr was mediocre and took off the Cali roll but acted like he just graduated with a hotel restaurant management degree and was not sure how to treat a customer. Honestly, he should've comped me and bought us dessert but knocking off an overpriced piece of sushi was better than nothing. Next time I'll go to the Henry. 100% better than this place"
1,"So let me preface this one star with the fact that we never did eat here. The reason is because despite the fact that the website says they close at 9:30 on Saturday, they actually were closed by 8:00 when we went there....TWICE! Note to Au Petit Four, this is 2011 and either update your website or inform people if you close early because it is slow. We drove from Southern Scottsdale to Arcadia and it was a waste of time. Also, waste of groupon money!"
5,"Adam was my server and did a great job of suggesting things as well as being a helpful opinion when I was choosing between one dish or another...
-Calamari was heavenly and really hearty and heavy...this is not the kind of calamari that you get at Olive Garden or most Italian restaurants...this was heavenly...perfect bit of spiciness and the portion was enormous
-Scampi Gabriela...was amazing...the pasta was perfectly al dente...and the shrimp were huge...a legitimate dinner portion that you had to take home
-Bread Pudding for dessert...not at all the type that you get at other restaurants again...this was mushy and didn't resemble the bread pudding I'm use to...but it was actually the best bread pudding I've ever had...it was simply mouthwatering
-I had a glass of pinot noir with my dinner and it was a great accompaniment to my meal
One of the owners...Clarissa came by and personally asked how I liked the food and the service...we had a long chat...told her what I loved and a few pointers...she has the same name as my mom so I instantly felt a connection with her...
This is a MUST when in town...I will definitely be back!"
1,"Badger game disappointment! Watered down drinks, slow service and rude management! 

My husband and I have watched many badger games at Pedro's. Good drink specials and multiple TVs have made this our go to spot for years. The service is always slow and the food is just decent but it's a good spot to watch a game...

Tonight was a completely different story! My Guinness tasted just like water, I suspect it was watered down. Our service was super slow. We were there for over 30 minutes before we received chips and salsa. The chips were hot but they needed salt. Their salsa tasted like ketchup. Once we ordered, again our food took forever. My cousin asked for sour cream and waited another 20 minutes for it. My food was ok. The tamale was actually pretty good. It needed spice though.

The kicker was when the manager, Brett, started changing the channels shortly after halftime! We asked the waitress what was going on. We came for a badger game. Our menus had badger specials, FB also listed their badger specials. Having just received our food... Yes it took two quarters, we couldn't relocate to another establishment. Apparently, there was a UFC fight on. We asked to speak to management, this is when we met Brett.

We asked about the game. He refused to turn the game back on stating that they paid $2000.00 for the UFC fight and they were going to show it. I looked around at the sea of red and asked him what his current demographic/ customer base thought of missing the second half of the game. He again referenced the cost. His solution was to have us move tables in the middle of our dinner to be in view of a smaller tv with no sound! 

Worst of all was when I told him we wouldn't be returning because of this he said,""Ok."" 

He clearly doesn't care about his customers! Awful!"
5,"Wonderful (WONDER-FULL!) place for kids and adults alike. I don't mind paying full/adult admission for this place as there is just as much to do/learn/experience as with the child's experience.

I'm so glad I waited to review this place until today (we went Friday, July 13th) because I remember my husband and I thinking  that, aside from the wonderful Body Works and Grossology temporary exhibits, some major improvements, additions and renovations were in order... And I was SO impressed with all the nice changes since we last visited with our kids (then age 3 and 7; now 6 and 10) a few years ago. 

ONE CAVEAT: If you live in the Phoenix Area, definitely opt for the membership, as just TWO VISITS make it worth the cost. (3 or 4 visits, which is completely reasonable just for the summertime will make the price even more attractive).
Another complaint I have is the check-in time for non-members (20 minutes on line just to step up to a cashier; all the while my kids had to endure the taunting view of the outdoor water/balls exhibit and I had to subsequently endure, ""Why is it taking so long?!"").

Other than that, this place ROCKS!
We look forward to going back and buying the family membership!"
5,"Awesome local meat market. Nice selection, incredibly friendly staff & great deals!"
1,"This one is a big fail. After having been told numerous times that I had to go to Clasen's Bakery, I finally went. What I found was a large room filled with unappetizing, boring baked goods. Nothing in here did I want, or have any desire to try. There were loaves of bread, but the selection is better at Whole Foods or Willy Street Co-op. The cookies had the panache and flair of the garbage that is sold in Starbucks. Chocolate chip, peanut butter, sugar? What is so European about any of this? Greenjim H said about high prices? I am not sure what he bought, I saw nothing that would be classified as high priced. The pastries were as boring as the cookies, danish, morning bun?

I don't know how this classifies as a European bakery. This is an average bakery, in a very far out of the way place. I am sure there are better places to go to grab a loaf of bread and a cookie."
5,"Best. Place. EVEEER. 
been going there for years and never had a single bad experience. everytime I go there i have higher expectations and they are always met. People here go out of their way to make sure that you like your food, waiters know evrything that goes on a sandwich down to the ingredients of the dressing. Best of all the prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is so Willy-like. 
do yourself a favor and try the veggie sandwich, your life will never be the same again! I pretend not to like meatloaf but if someone I'm with orders it, I make sure they don't have any leftovers. that's how good this place is..."
5,I went here when I was feeling a little under the weather and got the Super Soup. It was amazing! I got it spicy and it was most def really spicy! It was such a huge soup for 9$. I had one of my friends spring rolls which were one of the best I have ever eaten! I think its one of the best Thai places in Phoenix!
1,"The concept of the store is great, but horribly inefficient.  There are 6-10 employees there and not a single one of them could take MY MONEY!  I just wanted to buy a car charger and get out of the store.  Unfortunately, all associates were tied up.  I ended up throwing my purchase onto the table and walking out.

Here's a link to avoid the frustration:

5,"Best gym I ever worked out in. Period. I would've renewed my membership in a heartbeat had I not moved out of state this past Summer.

The best part about the place is the atmosphere. No TVs, no frills, brick walls. People are there to improve their bodies and health and most are serious and focused, but the people I've interacted with have been real down-to-earth and friendly. And it's not just for powerlifters and bodybuilders. I've seen all types (genders, ages, body types, fitness levels), there. However, I have to say that seeing a guy bench 500 or deadlift 14 plates definitely makes you want to put 100% into your own workouts."
5,"Pedros is a staple in the community.  A great place where you can bring family and friends to have a really good time.  The food is all made fresh, which is great.  For the price and the selection, you really can't beat it.

One other thing to mention...  Have had a group event at Pedro's - and also a couple events catered.  The catering menu is great - and they make it really easy."
1,Terrible in that my overpriced grilled cheese had 2 small pieces of cheese.  The bread was showing in many places and it would not even stay together with the melted cheese!!  When I spoke to the manager she said she would have to tell the cooperate chef??  She offered to make me another one but I was not interested.  I told her that I felt like we had been short changed on it and she just said she was sorry.  The senior menu had it with ham for $5.99 - I told the waiter that I just wanted the regular grilled cheese and he said ok.  On the bill it was $6.99!!! for two pieces of bread and 2 small pieces of cheese! ... We will not return!!
5,"Yesterday I saw the Actors Theatre production of ""A Christmas Carol."" For me, It's just not Christmas without at least one viewing of the Dickens classic, and this version was so good and so satisfying that I may actually forgo my beloved George C. Scott this year. Fezziwig teaches at the same school I do, and told me about the discounted tickets available. Even at the regular price ranging from $20 for children 16 and under to $47.50 for adult tickets, this production is worth every penny.

I was amazed by the quality of the special effects, impressed by the comedic timing, and found myself misty eyed at the end, having fully invested in the actors' performances. Even the kids were great, especially the little girl who played Fan (what a voice!) and the adorable kindergartner who played Tiny Tim (he is also ""Half Day"" in the Subway commercial). And in spite of the fact that I am one of those soulless people who despises most musicals, I found myself tapping my toes along with the songs. 

I don't want to ruin the surprises by giving too many details, but I urge you to get your tickets today. This is a show not to be missed!"
5,"My husband was craving anything besides hospital food, so I told him about one of my favie lunch places. I dropped by after work to get a boat lot of food that he requested. I got so much food, we needed a box to carry all of it to the hospital. And they taped my drinks so they don't spill. It was awesome!! 

Gyozas - 2 orders. YUM! 

Panko chicken bowl with terriyaki sauce - Awesome and still crispy after arriving to the hospital 

Katsu Pork Plate - The pork and salad was soggy due to the time kept in the container and the hot food steamed it. The flavors were good, so we recommended eating this dish at the place. 

Chicken Fried Rice - WOW. Good stuff."
1,I have never been so disappointed in an oil change! First they took my car and told me they would contact me when it was ready so I was free to do some shopping in Costco next door.  They never called.  I walked back over to pick up my car to find they never touched it and refused to work on it.  They said they heard a noise in the engine and would not tell me what it was.  (I had it checked out at different place).  Sears told me my engine could blow up at any moment.  All that was wrong was the O2 sensor was broken (nothing to cause and engine to blow up).  These guys were just lazy and did not want to do any work.  They chose to scare me instead.  I will never go back to a Sears Auto Center for anything.
1,"We have tried this particular Coco's previously and it was Abysmal, the food looked like it was straight out of a 'Hungry Man' dinner.. if only it had tasted that good.  About a Year later we moved into Coronado neighborhood and because it seemed to have a good sized crowd we gave it another chance. On that particular visit, the food was pretty good and the service wasn't bad for an early supper. On our next two subsequent trips our meal was slow in coming out, overcooked, Yet cold to the touch.

 We tried to purchase a 'Pie-of-the-month' On the First day of the month.. It was NOT Available.. and they did not offer any recompense or substitution.  We did go once for lunch  and it wasn't all bad..  But on the Final Meal there.. we both ordered the prime rib burger and quesadilla appetizer..The burgers came out 30 minutes later, They were grossly overcooked.. Crispy black with Dry DRY DRY prime rib that was falling apart  in not a good way.  They totally forgot our  appetizer.. and the server gave us the excuse.. They couldn't find any Tortillas... Ok.. we live in Phoenix,, There's  a Taco shop across the street, Numerous Grocery stores just down the street.. How silly..  They didn't care and when the Manager came out.. He didn't charge us.. but didn't really apologize either.. We shall never be going there again.

  The Tables were Grossly dirty on the edges.. carpet is filthy and people just hanging about on their laptops talking loudly and using the wifi..  The Servers seem nice.. but the entire Management seems to Just  Not Care.. It Needs a Good Cleaning.. Consistant cooks that know how to Cook and Maybe if Corporate came in and  took a hose to everything .. It might have a chance."
1,"Really terrible service from my mini-detail today. For $53 I got spots on the exterior, a splotch of Armour All on my leather seats that I don't think is going to come out, a pile or grit still around my gas pedal (that also was not cleaned)...all this even after I complained and pointed this out to them.  All they did was ran it through the wash again - only after a bit of back and forth - the manager was actually reluctant to even do that.  No offer to help me out on the cost despite the splotch on my seats,  They actually wanted more money to clean the stuff on the floor.  I certainly will never go back."
1,"Ok, clearly the writers of previous reviews are desperately hungry for entertainment.  I just went through this ""zoo"" yesterday, and I found it nothing more than a bunch of displays with 1 or less animals in them.  The animals always huddled towards the back of the areas making them completely unviewable.  I guess it was a zoo of Rocks n Sticks.
Furthermore, the prices for food (this isn't a suprise) is not just a ripoff, it's nothing short of thievery!  No one item of food was worth what they wanted.
Plain and simple - go find somewhere else to entertain yourself..."
5,"This venue is awesome of breakfasts, luncheons, etc. the staff is awesome and always are so on top of things. The food is so delicious and there is always plenty of varieties to choose from. The price point is great!"
1,"I was informed by Volvo I Am that I needed a new AC compressor at a cost of $1300. I had a second opinion at the Volvo dealership who told me that my AC unit was just fine. In addition to the unethical business practices of this shop, the owner was extremely rude and aggressive."
1,Service is horrible
5,"I was walking by here today and some saw friends eating out front. They welcomed me over to share lunch with them. I'd been planning on another place but as soon as I saw the pastrami I was hooked. I got in a short line (although about 20 people got in line right after me) and checked the menu. The way they were throwing the sandwiches together reminded me of Primanti's in Pittsburgh. They had a no nonsense-we know what we're doing-kinda attitude. There was no frufru on the menu, just great meat with a few ""specials"". I got the skyscraper which was a great, fresh bun piled with corned beef and pastrami. Then a slice of swiss and some deli mustard. Perfect! I grabbed a side of sauerkraut and a drink. We sat out front and I can just simple say that everything was just perfect. Cheap and tasty, and without a waitstaff, there was no tipping needed!"
1,"Nancy... I concur! 

Statefarm Insurance recommended this shop and i took it there because they said the service was timely and professional. Well they have had my Porsche Cayene for a month and it always a reason why it isn't completed. In addition, they have it set up so you get updated online and can view the status of the vehicle. The key is they have to actually update it and only happens when you make a request because several weeks pass and you hear nothing. Now, most people know insurance only covers rentals for 30 days. Well my 30 days is up today. 
Jeff, my rep was to call me back on Friday past for an update and now its Tuesday with no word. 

POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE ALL THE WAY AROUND!!!! I just pray the vehicle looks good!!!

I will have to call Statefarm and let them know how much of a joke this company is!"
5,Very impressed with Sam and Dave at Courtesy Auto.  Very professional and timely with the replacement of new rear brakes and rotors on my 2006 VW Passat.  Would highly recommend as their pricing was very reasonable.  Thanks guys.
1,DO NOT EAT HERE!!!  They have the worst customer service!!!  I don't go out to eat to be given an attitude.  I expect courteous service.
5,Everything is beautiful in there.  It's like going to MOMA. I can't believe it's in Phoenix! THANK GOODNESS! This is the place that has everything I've ever dreamed about.  I'm saving up for this gorgeous vintage hanging chair.  I hope it doesn't sell before I get my hands on it.
1,Gross!  Their tortilla soup tasted like vomit.  After two spoons full I proceeded to throw up in the bathroom!  NEVER EATING THERE AGAIN!
5,"I've been going to this interdependently owned video game store since the owner's first location in the early 90's! This definitely is the best video game shop in Madison! I mean, the only other places I can think of are PrePlayed or Half-Price Books for older cartridge based games. I usually hang around to talk and bring in super random gaming goods to sell or trade! Highly recommended! Believe It!"
1,"This is one of the of the worse zoos I have ever experienced in my entire life!  It's an embarrassment for the city of phoenix! They over charge you for everything  once you get inside including the $18.00 admission fee and there is nothing  worth seeing and they hardly have any animals to look at!  I would not even pay them $5.00 to get in this place in fact they would have to pay me to go back there because this is not a zoo but a big joke at our expense! I gave them one star for zoo lights.  Bottom line here is the Phoenix Zoo sucks and has nothing to offer except zoo lights in December!  So save your money and go to the
Worldlife World Zoo & Aquarium in the west valley because that's a real zoo!"
5,"Great food,  great atmosphere,  and my son took out the Big Unit!!!  Man vs. Food style....way to go D!!!!!"
1,"I've ordered cans of pro sheen in the past, and no problems. this time 2 cans were defective. tops broke off and it was dripping out,so i cant ship it back..(post office wont go for that) I've emailed Ryans twice about it and haven't gotten a response.its been a month or more now. Ive found another company that carries similar spray. really disappointed in them .bad costumer service."
5,"Owners here are great and why not support a local business.  I try to stop in here as much as possible instead of Circle K or any other gas station in the neighborhood.  It is a convenience store, not a grocery store but they have a great selection of random items you need at the last minute.  The owners are always friendly and remember what I order which is pretty impressive.  I once bought an item there that was freezer burnt and they happily offered to give me my money back and told me to pick anything in the store I wanted for the inconvenience.  Now thats good business!"
5,"Canyon Cafe is in the top five of favorite places to eat. My fiance and I recently celebrated our anniversary at Canyon Cafe.  

Pro: The chips and salsa rock my world! The entree's are delicious! The staff is friendly and efficient.  The ambiance is quiet and relaxed.

Con: The carnitas tacos are very greasy.

Canyon Cafe exceeds our expectations every time.  You go for dinner but you stay for the chips and salsa.  The chip basket includes sweet potato, blue corn, wonton, and regular tortilla chips.  The salsa is roasted and heavenly.  

Recommended: The bison burger, it is juicy and flavorful. The Verde Chicken enchiladas, love the sauce and chicken is tender.  The top shelf margarita, suggested to share but make sure to stir or the tequila will go straight to your head.

Can't wait to go back.  It's our little secret place that we enjoy because it's quiet and we usually leave feeling quite euphoric."
5,"Monty's has quickly become my ""can you"" place. What do I mean by that...

""You know your chocolate malt pie... can you turn that into a shake?"" YES

""You know the fried onions that come on the open faced meatloaf sandwich... can you put those on a burger?"" YES

""You know the biscuit that comes with some breakfast items... can I swap my diner roll for a biscuit?"" YES

The staff is extremely friendly, always up for great conversation and recently I've taken to sitting at the counter which is a blast... your meal comes with a free show!

So when I say Monty's is my ""can you"" place, I mean it's a place that doesn't mind me being a brat. And if they ever say no? That'll be ok with me. I may go once a week instead of my typical 3-4 (seriously how does that happen?) but I'll still go!"
5,"What can I say, best hand job Ive ever had!

These guys now how to handle my little bad boy. They hand wash getting him soapy and wet.. then they rinse him down so he glistens.. blow him really hard.. then rub him till he's like a shiny new penny. They even get down into my little guys cracks and crevices that most men wont go.

Oh how I love my little guy.. apparently they do to!"
5,"""Viad Tower Restaurants"" 

First off, I'm not sure that this is the correct name for the restaurant.  I will tell you that this is the restaurant on the second floor of the Viad tower in Midtown Phoenix.  

What a great find.  This is a nice upscale cafeteria style restaurant.  Everything is Homemade from carved sandwiches to pizza and daily specials.  It was Chicken Enchiladas yesterday.  I had a tossed Cobb Salad that they made and tossed in front of me.  It was great and huge.  I could not finish it.

The prices are very reasonable.  I will be back next time I'm in the neighborhood!"
5,"Nom Nom Nom.  The food here is so delicious!  My personal favorite is the fried green tomato sandwich and next would be the carol.  Of course my all time favorite is no longer on the menu, i am told if requested when not slammed, if all ingredients are there, they will make that too!  Goodness I love this place.  If you haven't eaten here, what are you waiting for?"
1,"It was definitely one of the worst ramen I have ever had in my life... I know I have such high expectations for food, especially when it comes to Japanese cuisine- but it was just so dissapointing, after reading the raving reviews about this place!"
5,So great! I was there for an event last week and we had a blast. The event was handles perfectly! Can't wait to go back!
5,Oh wow...we found machaca here...took it back on the plane.  Has an incredible and cheap Fonda....tons of choices.  Pasole was special.  Worlds latest pork rinds...great fresh tortillas.  Love this super mercado
5,"love their special biscuit, soft and delicious. the seafood is fresh and nice. endless shrimp is a great choice."
1,Terrible service on a Saturday night!? Watch your check. They add 18% without asking and it is hidden in with the meal charges. Don't know how I caught it but will not be back-ever. Oh and the food was bad all around. Spend your money else where!
5,"ok so dad and I went here 1 yr ago and got here after leaving 5 am est arriving 2pm pst but 5 pm est in our body

what we got isn't on the menu anymore? just wanna log for the records but we got some time of sampler, it was awesome, and this place is great."
1,Went there for lunch today 3/2/13.  Business hours posted said they closed at 4PM on Saturday's.  Then why the hell were they close at 350PM ?  I will never visit this establisment again.
5,"Best place ever to find your pet supplies - wholesale pricing  and you can bring your pet. Since many of the toys are down at Kona's eye level, he likes to pick 
out his own stuff.   Friendly staff
You can save a bundle here!"
5,"I love Noodles & Company, and fact being this one is only a few miles away from my home when I drive back from work - I always call in for a pick up. My penna rosa is the best from here."
5,Go Suns Go!!!!
5,"Super clean venue! Always remember to go early to get your food before the start of the game, a few minutes before the half and possibly towards the end! 

The wife and I grabbed some custom jerseys as we! I'm pretty sure we've adopted the suns as our new nba team"
5,"We have had season tickets to the Pops series for three years now. We love us our music! Last night we saw again the wonderful jim Witter who did a tribute to one of my favs of all times, Simon and Garfunkle. ( I know every word to every song they ever wrote. Yes I know nerd alert here) JW usually does a Billy Joel and Elton John tribute. Ha! Last year I even got to sing and dance on stage to Crocodile Rock. Na-na-na-na-na  Na-na-na-na-na!  Don't ask, but life goal number 1 completed! LOL! Well as far as last night goes, all I can say is that we were rocking the place. ( Well ok as far as one can rock out to Simon and Garfunkle) I am sure the conductor was cringing at how rowdy the third row was. Teeehhhee! We were jamming out to the music. 
( Yes sorry handsome conductor man. I know it is the Symphony and probably made you cringe with all that classical training in the house. Then the NY, Alice Cooper gang hooligan types came in-hahaha thus why I like the Pops more than the classical. I will go to classical shows too so really I am just kidding. However. I do love the pops so much more. I know, I know, I feel like ""Just Jack"" from Will and Grace. I love me my musical theater and showtunes, Gleek here.  
   Last year I even got to see my all time musical theater hero diva perform,  Patti Lupone. SIGH! Got to meet her after the show too. Thanks Phoenix Symphony for that photo op! (Life goal number two, check!) Advice, now if you could only get Mandy I would truly be in heaven. ( Life goal check number 3 perhaps?) 
   However, I do went to point out they do have something for everyone with an eclectic yearly calendar of different musical genres. I do worry about cultural Arts programs and budget cuts in Az so hope people continue to support them in any fashion. I know it is not NY or London but it's still good!  I also love it when I see the young set being introduced to the Symphony. We sat next to a delightful 13 year old young man last night. He was rocking out with us. ( Ok Dad listens to S/G in the car every day. But at least the boy didn't  appear to be having his teeth pulled out by being there)  So to all of my fellow music lovers, check it out, support local Arts, and enjoy!

Oh an afterthought- The person who sings with Jim ( can't remember his name) does the meanest, most awesome, best impression of Edith Bunker ever. I have no idea how a man can even hit a high note like that. If you ever have the chance to see him do this I would strongly advise you to do so. It is so fun!"
1,"I am running out of CVS pharmacies to get my prescriptions correct.  I went in early yesterday with a prescription for medicine that had to be ordered from God-knows-where, and was assured that I would be able to pick it up today.  Well, my prescription sat there for 24 hours before anyone got around to placing the order. Because it is Friday now, the medicine will not arrive until Monday.  I need my medicine and nobody seems to care. Thanks, whatever your name is, for your cluelessness.  One week later I have finally been advised that THIS DRUG STORE CANNOT GET MY MEDICINE, and they told me to look elsewhere.  Can you imagine having a pharmacy that does not stock/cannot get the medication you need?  I am sick to death of CVS...good f%^&*#@ bye!!!!"
5,Breakfast heaven. Grab the French Toast and a side of hash browns.
5,"The Heard Museum is truly awesome. It's not huge, but they make the most of their space, including short films, longer presentations, and a huge display of kachinas in telling the cultural stories of Southwestern Native Americans. Importantly realizing that Native American cultures are not dead, the museum contains modern artwork and filmed interviews with members of today's Native American tribes. The amount of information given is detailed but not overwhelming, and I would say that the museum represents an excellent introduction to Southwestern Indian culture.

One could complain that the Heard Museum doesn't document any of the internal Indian wars or strife, but on the other hand ,considering the racism these groups still come up against, perhaps its for the best that the rest of us just learn about how complex and beautiful these cultures often were and are. 

A final note should be given to the beautiful museum itself, which may be the only time I'll ever use the world ""beautiful"" to describe any building in Phoenix. It resembles images I've seen of Roman villas and its courtyard is very mellow, with a nice cafe and pools of running water. I would even recommend coming just to chill out with an ice tea in a stunning courtyard. I mean, where else can you find that in this town?"
5,"After researching indie shops on various sites including yelp and m3forum, I decided to take my '04 M3 to Bavarian.  I had a pretty vigorous oil leak and wanted them to install a new fuel filter and emergency brake pads.  I dealt with Ray who could not have been more pleasant.  These guys really take their reputation seriously and do thorough, honest work.  They found the leaking component and called me before doing any work.  Their prices were reasonable, a fraction of what the dealer would have charged and no doubt with much better and personal customer service.  They kept me posted on progress and completed the work sooner than expected.  Ray was just terrific to work with and though I will continue to do my own regular maintenance, anything else that comes up will be done at Bavarian no doubt.  Thanks guys, I'll def recommend you on the M3/BMW on line forums as people are often asking for local indie shop recs!"
1,"This KFC SUCKS! 2night the drive thru clerk asked,""Like to try our grilled wings?"" I said ""yes."" She said, ""sorry- we don't have any."" WTF?"
1,"Papa John's is great pizza! Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to get it delivered. After calling the store I was informed the front door of my residence was past the delivery boundary. My back door is adjacent to the street they deliver to. Didn't matter to the phone operator and never even considered finding a way to make it work. 

The employee's response, ""the boundary has to be set somewhere"" works in theory unfortunately this customer lives in reality. Really disappointed with the service being offered. 

I understand there are policies but being 20 feet past an arbitrary boundary is absurd. Thanks Papa!!"
5,"Coconut cream grits with collards and tomato sauce.  As vegan as it gets, and so full of flavor!  Had it twice...once on Thursday and again on Saturday.  Ran into 4 friends while I sat at the counter Saturday evening.  This place is the best."
1,"We contracted with Zee Best to have the floors cleaned at our business. 

My wife set up the initial appointment and explained in detail what we needed done. The owner quoted her a price and the appointment was scheduled. 

First Attempt: 

On the day of the scheduled cleaning the technician was 45 minutes late. We had to reschedule as our employees were not able to wait around for the technician to show up. The appointment was rescheduled for the following week. 

Second Attempt: 

The technician showed up the following week on time but immediately said that the charge for cleaning would be double what the owner quoted us the previous week. The technician said we were quoted basic cleaning prices and not the deep cleaning (grout + tile) that we needed. My wife and I were out of town and the technician proceeded with only the basic tile cleaning. 

Upon our return we found that the floors still were very dirty and even the basic cleaning that was done was sub-par. 

When my wife called the owner Abraham to discuss the issue he began yelling at her over the phone. She explained that she was the customer and he shouldn't be talking to her in this way. His anger escalated and she ended the call. 

Now we need to basically start over again. 

I do not recommend this cleaning service at all.

1,"Should have known right away to get out of here after drive through woman had to ask whether they use white or dark meat in their chicken burrito. She assured me it was all white, but she was all-wrong as a giant piece of thigh meat spliled out of the poorly constructed item upon opening. This was one nasty burrito that went untouched. Crinkle cut fries were goo reheated, but that's about it from this taco hell hole."
5,Little outdated... Rooms are a little small... But good hospital with good staff.
5,The wife and I ate dinner here tonight and we got the veggie sandwich.  It was amazing we were both blown away.  Will you please put this on the menu?
1,"This was my first experience eating Jack in the Box since I moved from GA to AZ 2 days ago. The service was horrible! Cashier had attitude when I told her I was still reviewing the menu. When I was ready to place my order she was very rude & sighing as if she needed me to speed up. Then I watched as she prepared her food, placed it on a tray & walked off as my food sat in the window. The drive-thru person came to see if I had been helped & proceeded to bag my food after I told him I was waiting. This place needs better service."
1,"I came here for one reason, the free Sunday paper. I love free stuff. Even if it appears to be absurd, like a Sunday paper. The deal is, you spend five dollars and they give you a two dollar Wisconsin Sunday paper. Okay, so know you know how I ended up here, let me tell you all about the magnificent Metcalfe's.

It is just a supermarket. Not of a Safeway variety, but a Gelson's or Bristol Farms variety. Despite the many Yelpers who proclaimed that this is expensive, its not expensive. If you are buying toilet paper or paper towel here, it is expensive, but it is no more expensive on food than anyone else. I don't care about some Brat Fest, I don't even care about brats. Cheese is just cheese, in fact, if you have been to cheese stores in New York and Paris, you realize everything else pales in comparison. In fact, everything pales to New York and Paris anyway.

Back to the review. The store is well laid out, clean, the produce appeared fresh. It was early on a Sunday morning, but a lot of the prepared foods were already out. They looked good, but I don't buy prepared foods in a supermarket, unless its Wegmans, but that isn't a supermarket, its nirvana. Thus I can not assess the prepared section. I do buy baked goods, and it is on this basis that the store failed. As I was walking down the bakery aisle, I noticed a slice of white cake. I love white cake. The soft, dewy white cake, enrobed in creamy butter cream frosting *cue the angels and ethereal music* Anyway, as part of my five dollars, I bought a 2.49 piece of white cake. *gag* How much sugar do you people eat? The cake was okay, but the frosting was just a sugary, you could taste the granules, nightmare. This is not white cake!!

There was nothing wrong with the store, but if your bakery sucks, it is a good indication that the other prepared foods are not going to be very good and there are also some other flaws. I didn't see anything that was unique or that would make me want to come here. There wasn't any Bell and Evans Chicken. I did see they sold Boar's Head cold meats, which is always a plus, but is it worthy of five stars? No.

Sorry Mr. and Mrs. Metcalfe (or whomever you are), work on the bakery, let me know and I will come back and re-evaluate you again."
5,"Recently bought a pre-owned 2009 Eos. Worked with Doug Marshall. He was quickly able to ""read"" us and introduced us to a model, which I,quite frankly, did not know existed. Within 48 hours, with Doug's description of the car and it's features, I owned one. He was the consummate salesperson, working out the details of the deal, getting the car ready, etc. During the final walk-through, I even commented, "" Boy, you guys think of everything."" Doug brought a degree of pleasure back to the car-buying experience. I'd be happy to work with him again."
5,"Incredible service and amazing food! Eggs Benedict meal was one of the best ones I have had in a long time! Prices are very, very great - fairly inexpensive!"
5,"One liner:  perch rocks

If you are looking for an awesome perch fish fry, Villa is your place.  One of the best I have eaten...light greasing and no grease.  It is Canadian Lake perch if that matters to anyone.

1,"On 12/26/11 our 2008 Acura TL broke down in the Wisconsin Dells. We had just purchased it earlier that year. It was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty. We called Acura Roadside Assistance and they sent out a tow truck that jumped us so that we could drive to the nearest dealer to have the car looked at and fixed. The closest Acura dealer was Zimbrick of Middleton and we dealt with Shane (the manager) in the service department. They replaced the battery in our car and then informed us that our car now had a check engine light on. We asked if they could pull the codes and tell us what was wrong or even clear them and see if they came back. He told us that we would have to take the car in its current condition with the light on because he said, ""It's the day after Christmas and I just don't have the manpower to deal with it."". My Husband reiterated to Shane that he please just pull the codes so that we have an idea of what we were dealing with, Shane refused. We were worried about taking the car as we were traveling from Minneapolis to Chicago and it already broke down on us once. Plus, with the delay of the battery ordeal we'd be getting into Chicago during rush hour. We decided to cancel our hotel reservation that we had for that night in Chicago and called Acura of Brookfield. They said they could get us in first thing the next morning to scan it and see why there was a check engine light on. So we spent the night in Brookfield and that dealer took great care of us! They even reserved a rental car in case it was needed. I just wish that's who we would've went to first. Oh, and I forgot to mention earlier...Zimbrick of Middleton put a three inch black scuff on the drivers side rear quarter panel of our white car while it was in the shop. When we noticed it and went in to ask Shane to take a look at it he became extremely short with us and was down right rude. He implied to us that it was there from before and it clearly was not. His level of customer service was appalling."
1,"First off, love Wild Thaiger, food is excellent, service is by in large prompt, courteous, and a relaxed atmosphere. 

However, I had a bad experience, where I witnessed a cockroach walking across the bar in front of me. I voiced my concern to Ola, she couldn't find it. But apologized. I was dissatisfied with this response and wrote her an email expressing my concerns. This is her appropriate, professional abbreviated response.

""As a regular you know we have an ""A"" rating because we don't have a pest problem.  I will be glad to share the pest inspection reports and monthly service schedule for the last eight years which we have been in business.  It would be a perfect world if I could afford to have enough staff to open all of our boxes in the parking lot and stock all of our products individually to ensure that unwanted pests do not enter our doors. Of course we have discontinued purchasing product from the supplier and they are aware of the problem.""

She refunded my money, and we're satisfied, moved on. 

I show up today with my party---and she pulls me out of the restaurant, tells me that ""i'm not supporting her business"" and that a few days after my email she gets an inspection from the Maricopa County Health Department, and they gave her a ""B"" rating. She proceeds to accuse me of calling them, and blaming me for her low grade. I inform her that I dealt with her straight, communicated directly with her, and I considered it resolved. At this point she tells me she won't serve me anymore after being a customer for about seven years.

Having never dealt with the Maricopa Environmental Services, I'm not really aware with how they schedule their inspections but clearly it was a coincidence that it occurred 6 days later. I guess Ola never thought perhaps it was a different customer, or in fact that maybe it was scheduled every 3 months?

At any rate her reaction to customer feedback is not only unprofessional but just makes bad business sense. 

Poor decision Ola, I'm really surprised your sanitation problem, and failing an inspection is blamed on your customers."
1,"I grew up with Manuel's. We used to go every Sunday after church growing up and that was back when it was still on 32nd St. Since I got older, the price has gone way up and the quality of the food seemed to go way down. Salsa isn't spicy anymore. Used to be that the plate was super hot when it was brought out to us, not anymore. One of the last times my family and I went there for dinner they charged us a 16% gratuity! 16% is way too high for any gratuity but we were only 4 people!"
5,That's A Wrap caught my eye on a trip out to Phoenix shortly before I moved here. I had high hopes going in and it exceeded my expectations.  I love the veggie wrap with jasmine rice paired with a refreshing and delicious glass of strawberry lemonade.
1,"I love thrift stores but I'll take my chances elsewhere from this Goodwill location. It is very stereotypical of what you would think a thrift store is:  filthy, cluttered, disorganized, musty smelling, pure junk clothing, and men who will stare you down while you shop. 

Good luck trying to find any decent furniture, even some that you don't mind re-finishing! There was not even a couple of nice basic pieces that I could take home and work with. I understand that some people might not have an option, but if you have a car with gas in it go somewhere else. The prices are pretty much the same as a nicer Savers or the like."
1,"I wanted to give everyone an update from the last review I wrote about the Phoenix Airport Marriott experience. So, the General Manager, Jeff Bhatti, replied to the letter that me and my colleagues sent to them about their associate interaction and they basically told us that they received the letter, apologized for any inconvenience.

He also wrote in the letter:

""It is our objective to provide each and ever guest a comfortable stay with utmost respect and privacy. Your comments play a critical role in our success and progress. I appreciate the time you took to bring it to my attention. Based on you comments, I have shared my concerns with the staff and emphasized review of our training and procedures. We shall implement and improve any steps needed to ensure that our guests have a positive experience at the hotel. We are grateful for having had many opportunities over several of past years to successfully take care of hospitality needs of our guests while in Phoenix area. We look forward to continue with such relationship and will do our very best to prove our commitment to our objective.""

When we read that letter, we just looked at each other like that was just BS and were not satisfied by the half ass letter we received from the General Manager. First of all, there were spelling errors in the letter, and second of all, for them to say that they provide each and every guest a comfortable stay with the utmost respect and privacy. The two words he used, ""RESPECT"" and ""PRIVACY"" were two elements that the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel did not demonstrate to us during our time at their hotel. The guest relations worker did not show us RESPECT when she was talking back at us and asking if we planned to make any more noise after I expressed my concern about her sending strange men up to our room w/out any warning or notice to bring down the noise level (which there weren't any, we were just talking in our room. 

There were no music on, no tv on, no blow dryer on, we were just talking our normal tones but I don't know if the walls are just SUPER thin or what but regardless, we should have received a phone call from them in the first place.). For her to say ""So you plan to make more noise next time?"" I wanted to be like ""No B****, I'm not! Stop being so fresh with me because I wasn't even trying to say that!! I was just bringing up my concern that there were two large men standing outside telling us it is our second warning and to OPEN the door when we haven't even received the FIRST warning in the first place!! Now, THAT is wrong and that is a violation of our PRIVACY!! Additionally, my friend told me that when we got into the hotel room, she noticed that those two men .. the SAME men that asked us to open the door, were checking us out at the hotel lobby. They were looking at us up and down which creeped out my friend. Since, we have 3 young ladies staying in the room, WHY THE HELL WOULD WE OPEN THE DOOR to TWO STRANGERS who were checking us out and Open the door for them?! We aren't even sure if they are hotel security. But regardless, the hotel did not make us feel SAFE or COMFORTABLE at all and again, me and my colleagues are extremely disappointed in how the management has handled our concerns.

Basically, the letter that was sent to us was BS BS BS! Our company will never stay at their hotel again and I will make sure to spread the word to all our friends and family because when I do inform them about our horrible experience, they are absolutely appalled that the hotel made no efforts in making up the experience for us in any way. The ""thank you for bringing this up to our attention"" is BS to us and we will make sure that everyone who is looking for a hotel in Phoenix will never come to this establishment again. 

Thank you for letter but we would rather give our business to another hotel that actually cares about their reputation and their guests!"
1,"This place is great if you hate things that get all assertive with your taste buds!

I really have no idea how they managed to make their food so bland.  Maybe if they spent some money on a recipe book instead of a graphic design campaign, they'd do a little better.

The fact that it won something from the New Times proves how corrupt that process is."
1,So slow. One cashier and 5 customers!!!!!

delicious! got a large pizza for around $10 as take out. best thin crust i've had in a while.

kind of a hole in the wall, but totally worth it. just too bad they don't open up until 4pm. there has already been a few times since we've gotten their pizza that we've wanted it but it's not open yet, so we choose somewhere else instead of waiting. those, indeed, are sad days!"
5,"FRABONI""S mmm.. walk in... now breath it in....Just stepping though that door you know you are in the real deal.
THIS is my personal must have GO TO place when creating my perfect italian sauce.If they did not exist, i would be floundering for an alternative.
FRABONI's offers San Marzano canned tomatoes, which are hard to find, Real Italian olive oils and global spices ( I love the choices of oreganos) etc.
Fraboni's is the only place in Madison to get real Ricotta Cheese available in 3 pd containers, and I mean good Ricotta, not the mushy watery stuff. 
They also carry imported FETA. If you are a FETA fan, please i beg you to try the French Feta. It is beyond creamy goodness.
I have to say, you can also get your Pecorino Romano here as well as your PARMIGIANO-REGGIANO 
Oh did I mention the full Italian Deli?? Prosciutto, mortadella, imported provolone and pancetta..i can go on and on( i use their homemade Italian sausage in my sauce)
Fraboni's is a TRUE Italian Specialty Store. 
I have not indulged in their ready foods, but based on the store itself, i wouldn't be surprised by excellence.
Please go in...be amazed by Italy in Madison. Don't cook without them!"
1,"To be fair, I am not yet a customer, so I cannot rate the actual quality of their cable/internet.  That said, I have so no such qualms about revealing their absolutely HORRENDOUS customer service practices.

I spoke to a representative yesterday to sign up for internet service at my new apartment.  I specifically asked the representative if there were any promotions currently available, in order to receive the best price possible.  He quoted me 39.99 as their only current promotion for basic internet (not including moden/router rentals, upgraded speed, etc.) Taking him at his word, I accepted, and scheduled an installation.  Thus begins the tale of woe:

-------------------------------------------------------------
-  Later that night, on the internet:  I see advertised in giant, bold, colorful letters, $24.99 for basic internet.  Just about half the price of the ""promotion"" the representative offered me.

-  I call the representative line to find out what I was told a blatant lie (in nicer terms, of course).  He confirms the promotion is available, but he doesn't have authority to change me to that price. TRANSFER 1, TO SALES!

- Sales also confirms the much cheaper promotion, but says it is an online-only offer, and she absolutely cannot give it to me:  I can only receive it online, and I will need to reschedule my installation.  TRANSFER 2, TO THE INTERNET!

- The internet promotion finds my address alright, but instead of being able to sign up online, every time I reach the promotion page for my address, I receive the same error message:  ""Your session has timed out or encountered an error. Please start over or click the ""Back Button"" on your browser. If you still wish to contact us.""  This occurs over 3 different computers and the same number of unique browsers.  TRANSFER 3, TO THE ONLINE-CHAT REPRESENTATIVE!

-  Online chat confirms again that the service is available, but I cannot achieve it online, only over the phone.  Having just been told the *exact opposite*, i attempt to point out the circular logic there, but to no avail. Apparently, reducing my price to their own advertised offer would be considered ""downgrading"" a customer, and he is not allowed to do that. TRANSFER 4, TO THE PHONE REPRESENTATIVE (AGAIN)!

-  The new phone representative tells me that as I am NOT a customer, she cannot help me at all.  Still loving the contradictions (the last one claimed that she could not downgrade customers, now I'm not even a customer?  Really?), I try to argue, but she claims sales needs to handle me, and transfers my call.  TRANSFER 5, TO SALES (AGAIN)!

- And at this point, after another few minutes of lovely Charter advertisements and soothingly torturous elevator music, I am transferred to... a voice mail.  This proceeds to Inform me that the Sales Depts. hours are over, so please call back later, and then terminates the call.
---------------------------------------------------


3 fun filled hours of lies, contradictions, and a misinformation campaign that would dazzle ANY public figure later... absolutely nothing was accomplished, except a gigantic waste of my life and a review that will hopefully reveal these horrifying business practices to all those unsuspecting cable-seeking fellows on Yelp.

Beware."
5,"Just went back for another Tuesday night dinner...

Romesco Cauliflower
Gnocchi
Soft Shell Crab
Goat Terrine
Lamb Loin
Chocolate Chip Pecan Pie
Olive Oil Cake
Butterscotch Brownie Brioche Pudding

Ridiculous. Top five best dinners in Phoenix."
5,"As a first time puppy owner, you buy too much to figure out what you need.  What I am glad to have bought here:

1.  Grandma's Bitter Apple Spray (only used it a few times to keep the pups from chewing wires and furniture legs but glad to have it on hand)

2.  Pizzles (Costco is cheaper by bulk)

3.  Nature's Miracle (my godson had a bloody nose on the dog beds, and this worked better than Resolve.. I'm going to start using it on my clothes.  Also use it inside the kennels post rinse.) 

4.  if you like Kongs and its snacks, best pricing here

5.  The large tufted bedding, it's machine washable and b/c I get the larger sizes, it doesn't throw my washing machine off balance.

6.  Really HUGE cow leg bones or knuckles (search hard).  I have them cut into 2-3 pieces at home, pups gnaw on them forever."
5,"Granted I only needed a new watch battery.  But I have to say this was a very pleasant place to stop and get the work done.  As others have said, Jaime, the owner and his wife were very friendly and inviting.  I enjoyed my 10 minutes there while he worked on the watch.  We had a very nice conversation and I will head back there to buy the next piece of bling for the missus. 

Nice personal service deserves a return visit.

Great find."
1,"Killing 15 roaches a day, trash piling on the ground all around the garbage bins because they are too full at least once a week, never ever having hot water (maybe once or twice a month for a very short amount of time) and heating and cooling not working even after being repaired. 

These are just some of the things that you will have to look forward to if you live here. Sure the rent is cheap and it seems quiet but try leaving for work at 4 or 5 in the morning, you'll find black guys digging through the trash cans. 

Good morning, is that the overwhelming smell of dog piss I'm smelling? Why yes it is. Animal piss puddles all over the sidewalks and good crap that the residents have yet to pick up. 

Sure you are paying for a parking space in your monthly rent but you'll have your spot taken or blocked 1-2 times a week every single week that you live there. 

If these things are things that you can look past for the price of rent try wrapping your head around suctioning 3 baby roaches from your sons nose because he can't breathe. This is a second floor apartment mind you,  imagine the bottoms are much worse."
1,"This is by far the worst frys I have ever been in. I am a pretty dedicated frys shopper, however, this frys is gross and dirty. The checkout lines are always out of control long and getting through the parking lot without getting hit by a car or cart rolling by, is a miracle. Though it is my ""home"" frys I will drive 4 miles out of my way to go to a different one."
1,"I driven by this place a few times, saying to myself, I gotta try it!
I finally had the opportunity to & i was brutally disappointed!  

I went during the lunch hour. Had an OK crowd inside. On the menu Board, it says ""try it, you'll love it"" So i did. I paid almost $7.00 for my steak sandwich. It didn't take that long to cook. (that part I was impressed.) When I got my sandwich, it was a skinny little thing. I took my first bite & the sweet peppers were cold. I usually like to eat the whole sandwich, but I had to leave pieces of bread behind because they were, just that, bread!

I've had steak sandwiches before (in philly) & they are soooo good. Nothing compares to it! but if your craving one, don't come here. Go to the other place that starts with a ""C"""
5,"The team here at Virginia Auto Service is the best. We bought a used car from another local service center and boy were we sold a lemon! We even own a business next door to the place that we have trusted to work on our vehicles. When the other shop refused to stand behind their work, and the car they sold us, we sought out the crew at Virginia Auto on the advice of a friend.

Robert took us through the engine of our vehicle and showed us all of the poorly done work by the other mechanic we trusted and then, he advised us on what we should do to keep our car running smoothly. The price was fair and the service was done quickly. We will be trusting only Virginia Auto Service from now on. We will be referring all our friends and customers here in the future.

All you Phoenix ladies who don't know a bunch about cars and need reliable auto repair with out getting lied to, Robert is your man."
5,Best pupusas in Phoenix
5,"Los Olivos is great!  I am a huge fan of any car wash that doesn't use brushes.  The people here are incredibly friendly & the do a great job.

They also offer detailing & window tinting.  I've never had a complete detail here, but they do a great job on mats."
5,"The only reason why checked this place out was because it was features on that show ""Man Vs Food"" well, I wasn't disappointed. The place was nice and friendly staff. So much to choose from. You better have a appetite for this. Unlimited chips and salsa can't go wrong with that. 
Reasonable food and prices. Definetely coming back. Happy customer."
1,"Sorry I am indian and as a indian this place blows .. Their aloo parathas are a cop out the just use samosa filling for the stuffing ...  The spicy pickles are from a can, also their vegetable curry is made with frozen vegetables not fresh ... Also I know its not a authentic place when the serve beef...  No authentic place will ever serve beef, they will serve goat, lamb, chicken and every animal except beef... what else, oh yea two of the servers started chewing each other out in the back of the room where EVERYONE could here.... Also they should invest in making ""chaat"" food - street food of india .. they had none of that one the menu!  I will give it 1 star because the garlic naan was good.. Also our waiter was really nice it was some guy who moved here from SD... Save your indian food craving and head down to Chicago"
5,An overall great place. Good food and very friendly staff. Great customer service!!!!
5,"Cheap prices with fast shipping and friendly phone service. I happen to go through a LOT of toys due to my dog's need to rip out their entrails in 2 minutes or less. Also, I get his glucosamine supplements here for about 50% off what I was paying retail. Awesome!"
1,"I don't want to waste too much time on this place, but since I mentioned it in another review I feel obligated to say a few words.

This is the worst Burger King in the world so far, and I have been to some bad ones. Everything manages to have a bitter taste that I just cannot explain. I seem to remember a time when BK did not nuke every single thing, but those days are a fading memory. Bitter taste plus microwaved texture equals food that hogs would turn up a nose at. Still the place is usually crowded. 

The one redeeming quality is the staff. I've worked a block away for two and a half years and a lot of the crew have worked there that whole time. They're pretty friendly considering what they get paid. Still, the food is just so terrible I cannot bring myself to give it even two stars."
1,"The food is simple, pure and uncomplicated; you taste (and hopefully enjoy) each ingredient. However, as with most minimally processed cooked foods, it does not travel well.  So, eat in. Luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure.   

My only down note is on the service. If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant, you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees. As a result, you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust (or whatever makes you invisible) wears off.  Based upon my late lunch experience today, the dust takes 4 iPhone e-mail responses or texts to be removed (10ish minutes). Regrettably, I only had three unanswered e-mails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees. On a positive note, when you leave (regardless of the time you waited), the invisibility dust seems to be removed. I know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver."
1,"Waitress good, bartender slow... Could have a few more drinks but.... Could not order since bar backed up. Need more staff on the floor. Oh and this little gem! (manager did make right but I pointed it out), drinks were not consistent in volume. 

Moscow Mule in copper cup was 30-40% bigger than in a glass. Because we were having those we ended up with multiples in glass since they ran out of copper mugs. We did the water test (pour from glass to copper mug) and was 30-40% LESS! Pointed this our to the manager (Adam) he said he was aware but disputed the 30-40% claim, said maybe closer to 20%! WOW, don't admit that! . I told him to head over to the table and we will show you. My issue is this, HE KNEW IT! The price is the same, but you are getting less. I told him that the house wins every time in this situation. Less Drinks, Same Price! Did, I mention HE KNEW THIS! With a $300+ tab, he comped 3 Drinks ($36). He attempted to right a wrong, but only after I made a big deal about it. Thanks for the 3% comp on my 30-4-% less drink! Great decor, waitress was great, but based on the inconsitance of the amount you are paying for...WILL NOT BE BACK"
5,"everyone has a comfort food so naughty santa wouldn't visit you for 5 years knowing you indulged...looks like i'll never be getting another christmas gift for as long as i live because i've tried nearly every one of rainbow donuts' tasty little morsels.

even if  i saw cockroaches crawling on the floor (which i didn't), i'd still eat their donuts. my favorite, by far, is the whipped cream glazed donut. i could eat 5 of them and not feel bad. their coffee is great too, and you could walk out of there with a couple donuts and a cup o joe for around 4 bucks. these are the best donuts you can get in town. so soft and chewy you wouldn't even know you ate 5 of them until you're keeled over with the sweetness stomach cramps.customer service was great, it's a family owned local joint, so it's def a place to respectably spend your moolah.

totally. worth it."
5,"Dear Angell Park, even when I don't know who's behind the wheel any more it's still pretty cool to see those guys drive the hell out of that clay track. Old school fun. Thanks for the nostalgia! You're still cool. Xoxo Stephanie"
5,"Red Lobster is  consistently excellent. The Biscuits may be a draw for some ,(altho I can only eat one myself). 
I go back over and over because of the great staff, the impeccable Long Island Iced Teas and the always Hot Steamy Perfect  FRESH Lobster. Our Madison Red Lobster aims to please like no other chain in town. The menu is extensive and never disappointing.
I am thrilled to have them here. Worth the time and money, every visit."
5,"Amazing food, amazing staff. Only one time did I go where I wasn't impressed. Top of biscuit burnt and chicken dry. Other than that food and service has been superb. Great comfort food and a nod to the south with the fried green tomato sandwich!!"
5,"Wilson's is a comfortable pub with a casual, inviting atmosphere. Reasonable prices, tasty food and fine service are the hallmarks of this establishment. Randy, the owner, is a friendly, outgoing intelligent host who has the unique capability of working diligently while personally interacting with patrons. Other staff and family members also work with Randy and clearly enjoy a good relationship 
with him. When you're at Wilson's, that pervasive feeling we all know but seldom experience of ""it's nice to be here"" sets in immediately. Expect to find an interesting cross section of ages, social orientations, occupations and personalities among the crowd. 
Enjoy athletic events? This is your kind of place. Multiple television sets broadcast games and sporting news throughout the day. Want to down a couple while taking in a UW, Green Bay or Milwaukee game with a spirited, interactive group? Wilson's is where you'll find it.. ""Badgers 'n Breakfast at Wilson's"" is a slogan we think appropriate for  this unique and totally appealing establishment..

1,"First review but not the first time here.

Originally came here because well I did enjoy the Van Buren location.  On a day that well, I wanted Quantity over Quality.... A point I will explore soon.

Upon entering I had already referenced the other reviews of this location. Seemed about average so naturally i prepared myself to not be impressed.

First things first.  The place was a bit of a mess (being gracious with my language). I understand it was at the end of their lunch rush but still... if your a staple of any city your image is very important so Tidy Up! Also there is nothing wrong with the idea of a remodel in certain areas like the bathroom and table area. 

*I almost always suggest an open kitchen for any eating establishment. I mean who wouldn't enjoy seeing my meats being cooked and smoked as I am contemplating my order at the register? right?

Price... a bit overpriced for the QUALITY I received and even the QUANTITY was not what I expected for what I paid.

Ordered the Pork sandwich meal with Sweet potato fries. Pork was dry and burnt, flavorless too, which I'm sure is easy to get away with since anyone who is in there usually sloshes their sandwiches in that BBQ sauce... not good enough for me or most foodies I'm sure. The fries where and had been frozen obviously, ughh.... like really? and to top it off they were also bland (doused them in BBQ sauce just like my sandwich to try to save them)

My girlfriend and her mom had ordered the same thing. but with different sides. Her Mac n Cheese looked awfully fast food/michelina's of them. Also to top it off after being home for about an hour or so and even through the rest of the evening me and m'lady felt awfully sick (Not a surprise considering if you take a gander into the kitchen from the soda fountain it looks like quite a mess back there....)

I will not be visiting again on my own account but also some people I lunch with are stuck in their ways. Id like to see a remodel, food quality improved to reflect proper pricing, CLEANLINESS (not just at my table when i have to clean it myself but in the KITCHEN) and well all those smiles people are saying they do not see there will come to the employees naturally. I see some obvious pride lost in the owners and employees alike.

I never like to see a business fail. Especially one that has such a familiar name her in Phoenix. Best of luck to you guys."
1,Ate here last night.  Food was barely tolerable and the place was so dirty. Waitress stood in the middle is the dining area loudly babbling about movies for 10 minutes annoying everyone. Never  going back.
1,"Went there last year after watching the Suns game. Terrible food. Terrible service. Really cool inside, they have some awesome stuff. Its clean and the musician was bada$$. But I ordered a burger well done with no pink. It came out so pink it was almost bloody. I complained and the waiter was arguing with me that its still good. I reminded him the customer is always right. He returned with a new burger just as bad. Also only had 1 refill the whole time I was there."
1,Second try ordering online. Ordered this time despite the difficulty communicating with everyone who answered the phone. $22 before tip is pretty steep for a med pizza. Hope it's good. Fingers crossed. Will update when food arrives.
1,"Went here today for a flat tire patch.  I left pertinent info and went across the street to kill time.  When I returned, a mechanic mentioned that I was due for an oil change, and did I want them to change my oil?  I said no (my dealership recommends every six months versus every three months) and the mechanic looked stricken, and went back into the garage.  

When I paid the bill, I was surprised to discover a charge for an oil filter that was not ""okayed"" by me.  

I returned home and noticed a sweet smell by my radiator.  Radiator fluid.  I can't figure out that none of those guys could figure out that there was a radiator leak while they were replacing the oil filter that I did not approve!

Taking my car back to the dealership tomorrow.  Never again, Goodyear!"
5,"Herein lie the finest falafel sandwiches in the area, and that's all that's needed to justify my continuing patronage.

The donuts fill the display cases with colors, and fill the air with intoxicating scents. So many different shapes and sizes, but the freshness and delicacy are consistent throughout. The ""Rapid Dozen"" is a good value, providing a diverse sampling of donut types to take to work, provided they make it that far.

Still, my main inspiration behind the countless visits through the years is the Lebanese cuisine, and specifically the falafel. You will find plenty of tasty dishes, from hummus and babaganoush, to kebabs and gyros, but the incomparable falafel stands above. There aren't, truth be told, more than a few real competitors for Madison's top falafel (Banzo is also great, then it drops off), but those found at People's are really top notch, competitive with any I've had throughout the country.

The prices and the falafels simply cannot be beat, and the owners are incredibly warm and friendly people who have been crafting joy through delicious food for many moons now. There is nothing to keep me from recommending People's Bakery with the full five stars."
1,"This one gets zero stars. I may be off but 24 hour shuttle usually means you have a shuttle that goes back and forth from the airport throughout the day.  No such shuttle appeared.  Ended up cabbing it (that's another story - look for Mayflower Cab in Phoenix) an having to make an appointment for the shuttle in the morning. Upon arrival, the worker at the desk was chatting it up with some person who looked like he had nothing better to do at 11:20 pm but hang out at this ghetto ass hotel. When we interrupted their conversation, we weren't greeted, no smile, nothing. Finally get checked in and make our way up to the room. Absolute bare bones, which we paid for. At least the place seemed clean to the naked eye. Who knows what a black light would have revealed.

Upon check out, Mr. Hospitality was still working the front desk.  We were walking in just as he was walking out with the coffee thermos. He could have taken care of us first then the coffee later. Nope. Coffee more important. He comes back carrying two pitchers of juice and a tray of pastries (both hands full). He bangs the tray into the window and sneers at us as if to say, ""Open the door for me.""  We checked out quickly and were happy to get out of there. Thankfully the shuttle was there already. (Run by a third party)

Recommendation: never stay here. Ever. For any reason. Sleep in your car. Days Inn should take away their license to use the company name. I've stayed at a lot of hotels and a wide array of them. This is by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. 

They only get one star because yelp requires it."
1,"The end of my time at this hotel is over, checking out tomorrow. Thankfully the MLB pre-season is over and I can get into a Hilton property. My job brought me here with little notice and for the past 6 weeks this was the only place in the area that had space for the length of time I needed. 
The good, the staff at the front desk and breakfast area are very nice. The property is clean and for the most part the place is quiet. When you have to move your life to a hotel and work out of a suitcase you come to expect a few things. Fresh towels, coffee, and the bed changed. I don't think my expectations are too high. Here I've entertained myself by betting that I wouldn't have coffee from day to day, I started to hide packets for the days I wouldn't have any left by housekeeping. So to come back to the hotel to find that the coffee pot hasn't been washed or the coffee grounds are still in the pot wasn't a surprise. The time I came back and found yesterdays trash in the plastic bag taken from under the sink and left on the counter where I had food. Today was the 4th time in a month and a second day in a row that housekeeping didn't come to my room. When I called again, I was told that housekeeping was gone for the day and they apologized. 
Again, the one star is for the friendly staff at the desk. My complaints were to have been taken to the housekeeping supervisor, I don't believe that there is one because I never got any follow-up to my complaints and the poor service by his/her staff continued."
1,"Danny's Family Car Wash is a reminder of all that is wrong with this world.  

This is nothing less than a third world car wash with all the dirty water, inattentive labor and indifference that you would expect from people that really do not want to be there.

Look Danny, here it is bro.  If you don't want to run a car wash, do something else.  If I was in your family, I would be the one that does not talk to you."
5,"First time renting a car and the people behind the desk were great!  They helped us through the process, making sure we understood everything and they had great recommendations.  I will probably never be back, but if I did ever return to Madison, I would use Enterprise."
1,"this place looks really nice.  The ambiance was great, but the food blechk!  I ordered the lamb and it was basically just fat.  My Beau ordered the schnitzel and it was salty.  Our waitress was rude, and our bill was 100!  (2 entrees a bottle of wine and 1 appetizer)  When we got home my beau was up all night throwing up.  It was horrible!  In their defense after calling several times, they reimburssed our bill.  That was the first time I've ever called and complained anywhere.  I used to be a server so I know how it is sometimes, but this was just terrible!"
5,"So this is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley.  The staff are awesome, you get monstrous portions of food, and really there is no reason not to like this place.  The bakery sells some absolutely great items.  It is your friendly, neighborhood Tolteca."
1,"After reading Judy F. 's update, I will no longer go to this establishment.  I was a BIG supporter of this cafe when it was at the Esplanade, however reading Judy B. or Frenchie B's comments, private and a review, I will never send anyone there.  And I've sent many, saying the desserts are wonderful.  The desserts may be wonderful, however, that type of attitude is not needed from those who are related to the owners or who are the owners.   Very disappointing.  Desserts are worth more than Mc D's yes however the attitude is not worth my time, therefore, I will have my caramel sundae for a $1or support another local cafe.   All yelpers try to help locals, however, this cafe doesn't seem to care and approach the reviews very defensively."
1,"nothing to rave about this place.
service was poor and the food was bad.
I know, I shouldn't expect much on cajun food in phoenix. but I'm always up for an adventure."
1,"Very poor customer service. Apparently when you only have one customer sitting at your computer is more important. In addition, very rude sales person who must assume they are the only mattress provider in Phoenix. Needless to say we walked out from what could have been an easy sale and I rather go spend my money elsewhere."
5,"The ""Fish and shrimp Ensenada style"" plate is amazing and the fish and chips are simple and perfect. 
Whenever I am here it is pretty empty for some reason, but the waitress is very nice and quick, I think more people need to stop in!"
1,"The food was good, however, 11 (and counting) of our 23 are now sick from food poisoning."
1,I got the worst food poisoning I have ever had in my life from this place. It has been three days and I'm still having trouble eating and digesting food. I do not recommend eating here
1,"Carrie Moe, the General Manager of this location is a liar.  I rented a 26' truck from The Atlas Ave location for my move to Minnepolis.  After driving the truck the 1MILE to the house I was moving out of, the truck broke down in my drive way.  The radiator was blown.  Seems to me the radiator was blown when I rented the truck,  It took just a mile for the temperature to come up and blow radiator fluid all over my driveway.  10 hours, and a dozen phone calls later and the truck was fixed.  Despite the fact that Carrie is the General Manager of the Atlas Ave Location, he continues to claim that offering me a full refund is not within his control.  However U Haul corporate says it is.  When I first called Carrie to inquire about my refund, he claimed he had no knowledge of my issues.  This, despite the fact that he'd entered notes on my case in U Haul's corporate ""Objections"" file.   I continue to fight for my refund. 
  DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH CARRIE MOE OR THE ATLAS AVE UHAUL LOCATION.  CARRIE MOE IS A CROOK AND A LIAR!"
5,"Decent cover charge, $8. Spacious. VERY good House music. No creepers. 

My girlfriend and I visited last night and we had a BLAST. Non-stop dancing for 2-hours because the music that THAT good and engaging; I had to force myself to take a break. I love to dance and to have a good time. We were both able to do this without being bothered by anyone and with enough space to do to so. 

We did not have drinks, so I can't offer any opinions on that. 

After a 4 hour drive from Chicago, on the same day, this was a GREAT place to end up on a whim. 

If you seek a clean good time with good music and lots of dancing, then the Inferno is the place to be. It was cozy. 

NB: No coat check, but it was not crowded so placing our coats on the seats and keeping an eye from the dance floor was not an issue. 

Happy dancing YAW!"
5,"Jen Reid is an awesome stylist!  She does such a great job with my color and is the ""brow-whisperer""."
5,"Great variety, inexpensive and exactly what we wanted on a Sunday morning."
1,"I ordered a pizza for delivery and requested it be delivered to my work office (right up the road) by noon. This was at 10am. By 12:07 I called to check on the order. I was assured that it had already left the building and was on its way. At 12:30 I called and was told the same thing ""Oh yes, she just left. It should be there any minute."" 12:50 and my pizza finally arrived. The woman who brought it had a piece of paper with my name on it and nothing else. She was on the phone, on hold, to find out if I had paid by card or if it was cash. I informed her that I ordered the pizza over two hours ago online and paid by card. She ignored me and we stood there for 5 minutes before she would hand over my small, now cold pizza. I signed the blank piece of paper. Now with 10 min left in my lunch break, I opened the box to find a cold and soggy pizza. The crust was wet with, I don't know what and the bottom was almost completely soggy. 
This is probably the worst experience I have had. One thing after another, not to mention the website crashed on me three times when I ordered, should've know it would be a problem.
Needless to say... I won't be eating here again and neither will my friends."
1,"If I could give NO stars this would be the place that deserves it.  We were in on a Thursday night at around 7pm.  There were a handful of patrons(certainly more staff than paying customers).  There was one bartender who was bothered to make drinks.  We watched him make a moijto and when he poured from the shaker to the glass he spilled some over including a lime and some mint that went onto the bar, he picked them up and put them back into the cup.  DISGUSTING! Then the 4 of us at the bar were ready to order another round and the bartender went MIA, we waved down 2 waitresses who went into the back and we never saw them again, 10 minutes later he came back and when asked ""what happened to you"", he responded, ""I am busy, I need to clean the keg lines."" 

Don't waste you time here!"
5,"I LOVE Athenian Express!  My mom works downtown, and whenever I have a chance I go to meet her for lunch, it is definately my #1 pick!  She gets the steak or chicken picado and I always get the veggi pita.  I crave this place.  I wish there were more locations!"
5,"Saw Les Miz (5th or 6th time) and it was indeed something special in this truly wonderful theater with truly fantastic voices.  The staging was awesome, the ambiance marvelous, the sound sytem spectacular, the enjoyment unsurpassed.  Am signing for season tickets!"
1,"My daughter did a trial class and loved it.  We signed her up and she went to one class and then got scared for some reason and would not go back.  I understand they do not do refunds, but I just wanted to talk to someone about getting a partial refund or credit for my other daughter to do a class.  Even if they didn't let me get a refund or credit, I just wanted to hear from them.  I left 2 messages with people and 3 messages on their machine.  NO RESPONSE EVER.  Just call me please and let   me know either way."
1,"I wont be back here again,  Ever.    Can one give less that 1 star? 

It is a bummer as I used to frequent this place as it is conveniently located for me.  Pamela the bartender is a sweetheart and works hard to recognize people by name.   Personalized service like hers helped me to overlook issues like the significant cleanliness challenges that are easy to spot if you look around.   If you think I am joking go into the bar and look up a the light fixtures.   That fuzzy stuff is probably 10+ years of dust.  Carpets are dingy and smells like old beer.  This place rocks as a nightclub on weekends I dont think that cleanliness is the priority......anyhow....I spent a lot of money there over the years, mainly for lunch or after work cocktails with friends.  Never more..... not because of the issues outlined above, but it is beacuse how I was treated when visiting the establishment not long ago.   Pamela was not working that day (sadly) and the male bartender decided that he was more interested in lecturing me on his beliefs than he was in serving my drinks and taking my money.  He had an issue, and apparently I was the target and cause of his rantings.   He was sad about the lack of customers and decided it was my fault as I mentioned I worked downtown.   His rants about downtown businesses was unorthodox and uncalled for.   I drank my beer and hurried out reminding myself never to set foot in the place again.  No wonder they are lacking for customers.    There are more and more restaurants downtown.  Time to step it up or get out of the way Matador!"
1,they are LUCKY to get even this 1 star ...if possible i would of given them -5.....EXTREMELY RUDE....I will never walk into this location again.....AVOID at all costs this location!!!!
1,"I went through the drive through, with about 4 cars ahead of me. After placing my order, it took about 15 minutes just to get to the window, where I then waited 28 minutes being ignored! I know the exact time because I looked at the time stamp on my receipt! There were at least three cars waiting behind me too! I finally got the attention of the lady inside to see what the problem was, and I was just told that they are ""short staffed"" and they make the food fresh to order, Which I guess means they go out back and wait for the chickens to mature, slaughter them, and THEN make the nuggets! I asked for a manager, when she finally showed up, I was not given an apology, just the same story of being short staffed. At this point I had asked to just have my money back so that I could go elsewhere (still no food) and I was told by said manager that she doesn't know how to do that....so I waited....and finally (28 minutes later) got my food, which was cold, and my milkshake had long since melted. Waste of my time and money!

I did get a phone number also for what I was told the general manager, called, it was a cell phone with no name on the voicemail, left a message anyway, no return call.

I won't ever be back, and I don't think they even care!"
5,"I have been eating here for at least 7 years and it's excellent.  Typically a group of us go there for lunch coming from work.   I love the pepper chicken the broccoli and the chicken on a stick things.  Ohh yes, the peanut butter chicken is also excellent.  My 4 kids really love going there too when we happen to be in that area on a weekend.  They've been going there every now and then since they were babies.    

I have heard that they may not be able to renew their lease as that part of the strip mall may be changed.  That would be very disappointing.  They have been a loyal staple spot for years while stores with in the mall have changed some of which are still vacant.   If you have not checked them out give them a try.  If you enjoy them go back for a visit incase they are soon gone."
1,"awful place, there are bugs, and the food is not the same and the staff not the same, does not know how to cook kosher, this is not a good jewish deli anymore."
5,"Member here for 10 years total--  I love clean! I love being able to walk away from noisy kids and go into another pool since i am a swimmer I like choices. Cool people -- members keep to themselves dont try to interfere with your workout with chit chat  I LOVE THIS !! We are busy working out no talking needed ! Great classes!  Great equipment and you can use other clubs too with their membership win win 
But umm yeah don't join K? It is hard enough to find parking as it is !

I went astray for a bit I will admit tried the Princeton Club to see what I was missing out on all the hoopla. What I found was old band aides that did not seem to move for days left around the pool and inches of standing water where you are supposed to wring out your suit NASTY !!

I found my way back and like the Prodigal son who returns home after making mistakes I am back and I am happy!!"
1,"Two adults and one kid equals a 40 dollar meal.  It's not like we ordered everything on the menu either.  The kid had pancakes and a drink, the adults each had an omelet and one drink.  The pancakes were great, but the omelets were super salty, and the ingredients were the furthest thing from fresh.  The service was horrible.  They kept forgetting things, and it felt like they were trying to rush us out the door, even though there was only one other table there.  

Another reviewer mentioned having to walk through a service area, and it's true.  To get to the bathrooms you have to walk through a narrow service area that seems awkward.  The bathrooms were nasty dirty, next time I'll just hold it.  

To top it off I got food poisoning and spent the rest of the day suffering immensely.  

Thanks International House of Poop!!!"
1,I sent this review in and all Dairy Queen said was thank you for your feedback.  Nothing more.  No follow up.  Gross.
1,WORST pedicure I've ever had -- EVER.
5,"Riette and the Bentley Projects are AMAZING!!! We had both our wedding and reception there and it was an incredible experience. Riette was super fast with responses to any questions I had and check in with me frequently to see if there was anything she could do to help. The venue itself is a working art gallery so between the paintings, exposed brick walls and high ceilings it made for a gorgeous back drop that our guests loved!! If you are looking for a really cool, modern venue in downtown Phoenix, I recommend you look no further than the Bentley Projects...."
1,"I really want to like Zoe's Kitchen. I do. I really, really do. 

I have been to Zoe's more than 5 but less than 10 times, and yesterday was my last visit, unless I want to stop in for some limeade and chocolate cake. 

I have tried MANY things at Zoes, and I try to listen to what others like .... I don't like their bread at all, so every sandwich I've had has been bad. The quesadilla is OK, but I'm not a big fan of flour tortillas. The chicken roll ups (I think that's what it's called) that I had yesterday (after a good friend's recommendation) were kind of soggy and yuck-o. I don't like the pasta salad .... or the potato salad ... or their slaw .... or cold rice .... 

Do you see my challenge here? The decor is adorable, and I really want to love the place, but I think I've paid my very last visit to Zoes. 

So, so sad!"
1,"Horrible food. It takes real effort to botch up a turkey sandwich...so because of their obvious diligence in that regard, I'm giving them one star."
1,"Was less than impressed when we noticed a patron sitting behind us at the bar with a snake around her neck.  When we spoke to the mgr. all he could say was he didn't know that she brought it in.  And he was doing the best he could to accommodate them with a seat on their outdoor patio.  REALLY, because they should be in your restaurant at all.  We asked him if the board of health would shut them down for this and his response was, ""She says it's not venomous.""  They were more considerate to the attention seeker with the snake than a paying party of 12.  I followed up with a call to their corporate office and spoke with their area manager.  He plans on coaching that store manager on ways of better handling situations like this.  His empty apologies and hardly gracious $20 gift card will not be getting me back as a customer!"
1,"There is definitely a reason why this place gets such bad reviews. I thought it would be quick and convenient to stop in for an oil change. They up sold me on the more expensive fluid topper and ""free"" car wash for $35. After finally getting my car I sat down to drive off and I see is a completely dirty floor mat on the driver side. I pointed it out to the guy that gave me my keys and he said ""yeah that's still dirty, should I take it back and have it redone?"" Uh, yes, please. My windshield is still dirty on the inside and out, and the back windshield has water spots all over it! 

I'm tempted to take it to Jiffy Lube to have them check the fluids to see if they even topped them off. There was an attitude of less than mediocre at this place.  Unfortunately, I don't care how close you are to my house, Danny's, I won't be back."
5,"You'll be treated like royalty at the Maharaja. 

I first came upon this place by chance. I was in town for work and noticed that there was an Indian restaurant nearby. After reading the great reviews on Yelp, I knew I had to try it for myself.

I ordered the Chicken TIkka Masala along with Naan bread and a cup of chai. I ordered the food to be Indian hot. The waiter replied, ""I like your confidence!"" It was very tasty and hot just as I like it. 

The restaurant was well kept, the staff treat the guests as royalty so the service is wonderful, and the prices are decent for what you're getting.  

Don't forget to stop by the Indian grocery that is located next door to this location! It has a large selection of items so that you can make your own Indian dinner at home. 
Will I be back the next time I'm in town?
Absolutely."
5,"I had an awesome experience at Tom's Tavern on Sunday. I live nearby and decided to visit for the first time with my girlfriend. We had the brunch buffet that had some good breakfast foods along with some munchies to enjoy during the games. Although we weren't drinking, the bar has happy hour prices which I'm sure many others enjoyed. 

During the game, a pair of Arizona Cardinal cheerleaders came in and started fraternizing with fans which was an awesome addition to the experience. I will definitely be returning."
5,"I love Bongo.  Staff is very knowledgeable and always helpful.  Movies are cheap, especially if you go with the bongo bundle or the prepaid card (I forget the details, but I think it's something like 10 movies for $24 or so).  I prefer Bongo to Netflix because I feel I end up getting movies that I'm in the mood to watch."
5,"There's nothing better than a Baseball game on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. The Northwoods League is a fabulous concept. Great Baseball at a reasonable price. You get to watch some of the best College prospects in the country at a state of the art Minor League Stadium. A baseball junkie like me couldn't ask for anything more. 

 Like most Minor League teams, the Mallards kept us entertained with a wide variety of gimmicks. My Visit coincided with Fathers day so there was a meat raffle for the Dads that I gladly entered. I don't have any kids, but I wasn't going to let that get in between me and my meat. There was also a dance off between the Grounds Crew and a Mascot, t-shirt t throws and lots of other interesting side shows. Fans who catch foul balls can even trade it in for a free Hot Dog. Although I have to admit that its a little annoying when the PA announcer yells Wiener after every foul ball.  

 I'd like to say my day with the Madison Mallards ended on a happy note. But I have to sadly report I went home without any free Fathers Day meat. I didn't get the meat, but I did get to see some future Big League players show off their talent at a beautiful Ballpark. And I had a damn good time doing it."
1,"The worst customer service you could ever imagine!  I read the reviews and still bought a groupon because they are so close by our home.   They refused to accept our groupon because their computers were allegedly down upgrading their groupon program.  Their cashier Tereasa  had plenty of attitude in telling us that there was no way possible to redeem our groupon, so we had to pay full retail price instead!  She wrote a messy note for us to walk out and get our car back from the line of cars being washed!  She did not have a phone number for her manager, so we had to just chalk this one up as another failed effort for consumers to use a groupon at Danny's."
5,"This review is for Banfeld, the adjoining vet office.
This is a great veterinary office, I wouldn't go anywhere else. The staff is so nice and knowledgeable, and they have pet insurance, which has saved us hundreds of dollars this year alone!"
5,"I always crave Vin Santo, even though I haven't been there for years, I still have family back in Middleton, and every time we visit, we have a feast! I truly believe it offers some of the best home made Italian food in the midwest. A real hidden Gem. And considering multiple family members have worked there in the past, we know what a tight ship is run, and how genuine the owners are in their hospitality and insistence for high quality in everything they do. Please give it a try, and DO NOT pass on the breadpudding/tiramisu for dessert : ) be warned that it may ruin you for life on anyone else's recipe!"
5,"It's been 18 months since my first experience with Dick & Arnie's, and they continue to impress me - I visit them at least once a month.  Every cut is as excellent as any I've ever had, and Ka is not only an absolute gentleman, but a master barber.  He listens and honors every request; I can't say enough great things about him and the crew at D&A's.  

It's not fancy, but the cuts are superb.  5+ stars."
1,"Update....711pm and still sitting I the same chair.

Update two.....850pm. Just got called back!!!!! Yes.....but wait. Just to wait in another waiting room inside the ER.

Final update, left at 1130pm without any test results.  They said I can wait 3 more hours or they can call me later.  

I chose to leave and they called me at 3am to give me my results."
5,"Thank you, thank you, Madison Mallards, for inviting the community to the fireworks on July 5. I hope this becomes a new tradition for Madison's Northside neighborhoods.

The run-down:
- I was glad to see you open the stadium for fireworks viewing after the game. Everyone was welcome, even if they did not attend the game.
- The concessions were still open and serving beer and snacks.
- Attendees could sit in the stands or have a blanket on the outfield grass (which is soft as carpet, by the way).
- There was a live band playing great, American rock songs from the 1980s and 1990s. Thank you for not playing that Lee Greenwood song!!!
- The fireworks were great. They were large, didn't last too long and the right distance from the stadium for viewing.

Spectacular!"
1,"This place makes me nervous just thinking about going there.
I have officially decided I am never going back here again. I will drive 15-20 miles to my nearest Sprouts or the Fancy Fry's in Scottsdale before I ever drive 1 mile to get to Safeway.
It's that bad.
Not only is the parking lot notoriously sketchy with inconsiderate drivers abounding, but there are numerous problems inside the store, as well:
1) You walk in to a rather dimly-lighted store, usually with a sour-faced security guard blocking your access to the carts.
2) What carts you ask? That's a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill. I actually saw the cartboys leaning against the cartrails, laughing and having a heck of a time. Look, I get it, it's hot outside and you don't want to get get the carts, but C'MON!
3) The first thing you see upon walking in may or may not be a ghetto display of moldy-looking fruit, or on  the 4th of July, a teenage employee roasting hot dogs on a bunsen burner with open containers of ketchup and mustard on a rickety table.
4) Venture into the produce section, and you will meander through very difficult twists and turns that your cart may not even fit through. Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!
5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.
6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.
7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be ""checked out"" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.
8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done. But you are so eager to get out of there, you simply don't care to go back and ask for it.

Oh, and there may or may not be trash on the floor.
If Safeway as a nationwide brand prides themselves on safety or service, they need to get their corporate people in here to take a look at this store, and either condemn it or fire everyone who works here.
It's even more pitiful because they are the closest store to everyone who lives downtown, so they could easily be the most popular.
Please, downtown, replace this disgraceful store with a Whole Foods or a Sprouts or a place with a shred of human decency."
1,"I only went because I had a coupon for a free Bacon Clubhouse Burger which was as expected... blah.  With all the wonderful Non Fast Food places to get a burger these days (at a fairly competitive price) why ever choose fast fast food?  Really?  Why?

I haven't been to McDonald's in about 5 or 6 years and no reason to ever go again."
5,Went to go see the Grand Canyon IMAX show.  It was so good!  3D and everything.  I keep telling all my friends to go check it out!
1,"I've tried really hard to like this location since it is close to work, but everything about it is just no.

First off, it's BK so the quality of food is not great anyway, but this location tends to be more on the weak side.

Secondly, the staff consistently make errors on orders, wasting food and customers' time when they have to remake something. What's worse is they're usually rude about it. It's like hey you didn't type it into the register correctly, that's not really my fault. They will argue with you and make sure you know you can't have it your way, no matter what their slogan is.

Lastly, they don't honor coupons the correct way. I just went there with a buy-one-get-one-free coupon that blatantly says I would get a free Whopper sandwich of equal or lesser value with the purchase of one. NOWHERE does it say that it excludes special Whoppers like the Angry Whopper, etc. So when I asked if I could get an Angry Whopper and the free one be a regular Whopper, the Hispanic, older (maybe 40s) woman with long, painted nails (describing her so you know to stay away from her - she is referred to as the ""Latina hussie"" in the other post) asked me passive aggressively if I wanted an Angry Whopper and two regular Whoppers.

No, that is EXACTLY why I was asking if I could get that deal because other BKs actually honor the coupon and its ambiguity. I said the coupon didn't specify but she handed me the coupon, roller her eyes like she had something better to do, and said it only applied to REGULAR Whoppers. Okay, so never going back to your sh*thole because other BKs actually take the coupon and apply it to any Whopper, thanks."
5,"Wow. Have traveled all over the country, experiencing the local cuisines in each city I visited.  The food here was the best mexican I have ever had, bar none.  Highly recommended!"
5,"Best Mexican food in Phoenix hands down! This place is one of my weekly lunch go to's. They have great lunch combination specials and every person gets soup to start. The hot sauce is hot hot hot, but so delicious! It gets pretty busy during the week for lunch, so be prepared to wait about 15-20 minutes if you are going during peak times."
5,"Stopped in to pick up some lunch today, and I went with the veggie jackson. i ordered it sans eggplant, so it came with broccoli, asparagus tops, carrots, onions, feta cheese, garlic rice and a balsalmic salsa. It was exactly what my tummy was hoping for. :) I opted for the tortilla chips and salsa today instead of the miso soup (which is delicious), and was happy with my choice. the salsa is chunky, with lots of veggies and flavor. The place was pretty empty, so it didn't take long for my food to come up. Quick, affordable and delicious!"
5,"Quirky and comfortable, the Paisley Violin is like a non-conformist's hideaway. An unassuming building in a slightly questionable but slowly emerging art district encloses a cafe/gallery/artists-haven that serves unique sandwiches with daily specials, a full-service coffee bar, free wifi and live music. The space is quite small, especially on nights when there are musicians performing, but that just adds to the intimate and welcoming atmosphere.  The staff is extremely nice, friendly and very accommodating, and the clientele are the same.  

On my first visit there I had the olive bowl (watch out for the olive pits!), the paprika turkey sandwich and their unique daily soup special-- chipotle salmon chowder.  The turkey sandwich was delicious and the soup was a bit spicy (duh, it had chipotle in it!) but very interesting, with flavors I've never experienced.  I ended the meal with a cafe mocha, and I must say what a way to end a meal.  This was the BEST mocha I've ever had (that is why I am giving this place 5 stars!!!) Overall, a delicious meal and a wonderful time enjoying some great indie and local musicians.  I'll definitely be going back again real soon!"
1,please!! save your time and hard earned money!(and save your dignity 2!) the woman at the office is SOOOOOO unprofessional and disrespectful and does not care if you stay there or not! she even got irate and cursed at me and my g.f for accidentally taking her bed cover! and see even kept our deposit for it!!($29 and didnt want to give us a receipt! kinda weird??)...its obvious she dont like her job!...and she was treating the new trainee like she was a 5 year old that didnt know nothing!(who was older than her and have no elderly respect also...sad btw)and the spanish speaking maintnance was very nice and polite but i could not say that about the russian-ish maintnance man he was also very disrespectful and annoying...as far as the actual living condition they are NOT ok UNLESS you are a drugee prostitue(had 1 next door) or a child molester that needs to get a room and get away from the PHX police!...looks like they were old run-down apts. converted...SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!...i hope the woman at the office and corp. see this review!
1,Update: Filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau on 6/5/13... to date the company has not cared enough to respond.   Make sure you think twice.
1,"Blech.  My brother heard this was the best Chinese buffet in Sun Prairie.  Maybe that is true, but it must be the only Chinese buffet in Sun Prairie.

I'm not giving it a hard time for ""authenticity"" or any of that eaither.  I love me some good Americanized, crappy Chinese food.  Here, even the stuff that was out fresh from the kitchen (which was mighty slim picken's) was barely edible.

I was really looking forward to some good old MIdwestern Chinese buffet, too.  The Chinese food options in Portland are actually very lacking, the last really good stuff I had was from a strip mall in Crawfordsville, IN.  Seriously, they can do it right but everyone else serves lukewarm, tasteless piles of mystery?  Gotta be kidding me.

Most options seemed to have been sitting for way too long when we got here, and it was peak dinner eating time.  I should have been tipped off by the low number of patrons at this ""best Chinese"" but I like to give the benefit of the doubt.

You are better off making Ramen noodles at home and calling it chinese food."
1,"Visiting Postino Wine Cafe makes me feel like I am in another city... an urban, metro, pedestrian city such as San Francisco. Its casual, yet sophisticated and quite enjoyable. I recently visited Postino with two friends and had the Bruschetta -- we selected the Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil, the Smoked Salmon and the Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. Thumbs up on all of these yummy appetizers! The clientele is a hip, diverse crowd reflective of its gentrified, charming neighborhood of mid-century ranch homes, and yet just a hop from the Biltmore and Arcadia neighborhoods. Ah... Phoenix is growing up! Wish I knew more about wines to tell you more about that. It appeared to be a nice selection and there were bottles you can buy to take home as well. Parking is a challenge, however I will definitely be back.
http://www.postinowinecafe.com/

Update: Postino's is one of many restaurants/bars in AZ that permits concealed weapons without permits and is noted on the Arizona State Rifle and Pistol Association in their CCW Cafe page: http://www.asrpa.com/ccwcafe.html For that reason I am reducing the previously 5-star rating to 1-star."
1,"My boyfriend and I traveled an hour on Thursday to come to your store based on the reviews and advertising of your business. We ordered two sandwiches, one Italian sub, and one sandwich with mortadella only. We also bought the imported Parmesan Reggiano cheese, a jar of hot cherry peppers, a package of the imported long ziti, 1/2 lb of Hot Capicola and 1/2 lb of Mortadella totaling approximately $80.  We are from NY and have Italian in our blood. We are used to good Italian delis in NY.  Yours doesn't even come close.  I should have realized when there was no smell of cheese when we walked in. The sandwiches were ok, we ate them there. Your store was very clean, not sure if that is due to lack of business or what. When we got home, my boyfriend tried the cheese, he said it was tasteless.  I just made a sandwich with the hot cherry peppers, however, I noticed that the jar cap was popping, which means it's been opened. I tried them anyway and they are tasteless!  Your prices are very high and then to have tasteless cheese and cherry peppers? I told my boyfriend we should come back to your store and demand a refund for the cheese and peppers, which was about $40!  But how much gas are we going to spend traveling back to you?  The proper thing would be to credit his credit card.  Hopefully, you will see this and do that."
5,"This cafe has much more than you would think. Artisan sandwiches. Yummy fries. Friendly owner. The place is immaculately clean and decorated so tastefully. I had the pesto chicken and fries. Very hearty. Great prices, too."
5,"I've been living in Middleton for about 9 months now, and I'm giving the Village Green five stars for being excellent at what it is: a small, local bar with great service and interesting patrons.

To us, the Village Green is the place we go when we want to get out of the house for a drink and some company. Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you. They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), great burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays). All the food is cooked right behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean. They make good drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types. Bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them. 

The Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending. The place is closed on Sundays, and rarely stays open past midnight - it's just not that sort of bar. Go across the street to Hody for late-night drinking. Any other time though, I promise you'll find the company much more enjoyable at Village Green."
5,"I have eaten at the Matador since the 80s and the food has been consistently good.  I like the large downtown location - it's convenient and there's room to meet up with all of your friends before or after an event.  The full service bar is great - really old-fashioned with lots of wood.   Love the salsa (both kinds!) and the service has always been acceptable - sometimes a bit slow when they are busy, but if you have a deadline, they are happy to hurry your order along.  Great food, friendly service, and a convenient location - what more can you ask?  I even had the Matador cater my daughter's bridal shower - awesome!"
1,"Do want crappy service?  Do you want to be treated poorly by waitresses, managers and have rude nasty comments made to you?  Then pay a visit to Coach and Willies!!!  This hole will be right up your alley!!!

We stopped there (a group of 5) prior to a DBacks game.  My friend ordered a burger without onions and it came with onions.  No biggee, and we told the waitress right away.  She never came back with a new burger nor did she want to remove it from our check. We never saw her during the entire meal it was so clear she was avoiding us on the burger incident.   When we mentioned it to her at the end of the meal, she was pissed and got nasty.  We said she should take it off the check but came back and said,"" I already ran your card so just take it out of my tip"" and stormed away.  Then midget tough guy manager comes by and tells us how we are not being nice to our waitress and we should leave.  WTF?  The food is OK, if it's not cold when your get it.   The owner is the local bar drunk.  

Don't bother going to this dump. Vote with your money.  It's just not worth it.  Look at the other comments.  The Service here just sucks and the employees are taught to have really bad attitude.  What would you expect if your owner were a drunk?

We can't wait to see this dump go under."
1,"Okay, I have lived in Phoenix and in LA. I have always thought LA was more expensive until my experience at Maroney's Cleaners. Holy Crap Ohla!!! I paid $7.65 for a pair of lined pants to get cleaned by them. Now, I have paid anywhere from $1.50 to $5.50 but are you kidding me $7.65. Then to top it off...I was a bit disappointed in the actual dry cleaning service because my pants were not perfect!!! So, after I was done throwing a temper-tantrum in the tahoe I then proceeded to call and text everyone I know (okay just kidding) about my frustrations. The drive up service is convenient however the price is NOT WORTH IT!!!"
5,"I do not frequent stadium venues but compared to the ones I have been to, this one is pretty nice!!  Pretty much anywhere in the house you can get pretty decent seats.  I would pick seats that are located in front of the entry way to the seats and not behind it and would also avoid the nosebleeds.  Other than that, anywhere should be decent."
5,"Great place for all alterations!  I relocated to Madison from Chicago and needed a place to help me with a bridesmaid's dress fitting.  The dress had a lot of lace, making the alterations slightly more complicated than meets the eye.  

Darlene did a GREAT job.  The dress fits like a glove.  Woo hoo!  I will definitely be back with any future alteration needs."
5,I came to Ultimate for a full foil. I have platinum blonde hair and I'm trying to make it look a more natural blonde. After Lisa was finished with my hair I was in awe! I am always so critical of my hair after hair appointments and it takes me awhile to like it. I've had two appointments with Lisa and I LOVE her work... I will be seeing her for as long as I live in the area. She also gave me a paraffin hand dip and a nice neck massage. She is the best in town. Seriously. :)
1,"This is part of a local chain, this location is the missing-link in the chain.  This location is in an older part of Phoenix not a location for the tourist.  
I can only compare this place to my high school cafeteria during ""Mexican"" food day.  The place is as cozy as a cafeteria, the servers must have been trained by the ""lunch ladies"", the noise from the children is only outdone by the screaming parents and the food is a step below Taco Bell.  If you are looking for Mexican food head back to high school.  In a city full of Mexican restaurants you can find a better place by throwing a dart at the map."
5,"I checked out this business in connection with a Groupon, and after becoming very disenchanted with the dealership. After my regular service adviser was ""transferred"" after returning from maternity leave, I was regularly facing pricey service visits even for regular maintenance.  The increase in cost was pretty odd since it corresponded with the change in my service contact (they are paid on commission at the Acura dealer).  I was also pretty annoyed by the ""transfer"" of my trusted contact.  So, I started my search for a better option.  I went ahead and purchased the Groupon after checking out the business on garagefly.com.   I was very impressed with the service here -- they did a comprehensive inspection and everything checked out fine. They made no attempt to up-sell me on anything, including brakes, which the dealership had coincidentally told me would ""definitely be due"" on the next service visit (my brake pads were on the good side of fine when VAS checked them). Everyone seems very honest, and friendly, and while I don't know about the prices for major repairs, it's good to know that they'll only be charging you when you really need work done (unlike the dealer).  They also have a driver to take you where you need to go while they work on your car."
5,"THIS PLACE is great. I love this joint. The staff is awesome and the food is great. Their grilled cheese is so good. I also love their beer selection and their full bar. I have a hard time decided what to order when I go here because everything looks so good. This place is tucked away and can easily be passed up, but don't make that mistake. I love it here."
1,"This is just sad. Half the stores are closed, and the other half are under rennovations. I walked away, as I was at the convention center, willing to spend a few shekles... and left annoyed at the state this center is in."
5,"My wife, the picky vegetarian had some bizarre avocado sandwich and a side of brussel sprouts.  If we end up moving to Phoenix, this restaurant may be the reason why."
5,"Before you read my review, read David B's. It's much better and more informative. After you finish his, then read mine. Ok? It's because I'm going by memory from 4 years ago and David B. lives in Phoenix and has just been there.

I was born in Scottsdale, went to school in Phoenix and go to Giant's/A's/Angel's/Padre's/Brewer's/Mariner's and now the Dodger's for Spring Training. The desert is in my blood with all of the red sandstone rocks, cactus, roadrunners, and bluebelly lizards. As a child, I would go out and collect boys things... like snakes, crawdads, eggs, aquamarines, agates, spiders, then bring them home to an unhappy Mother. But I also went to school with actual Native-American kids who would wear their cool native clothes and so I got hooked on everything-Indian. Plus, we would go on amazing school field-trips to the local museums. Yea, for getting out of school...

The Heard is known as the other major Phoenix destination besides the Phoenix Arts Museum but I personally feel it is much better. It is world-class in its exhibits of Native American artifacts, such as pottery, katsina dolls, sand paintings, rugs, baskets, textiles, jewelry, blankets, it's all here. If you love American history, especially Indian, you have to come here and soak it all in. 

The founders, Dwight and Maie Bartlett, loved their Southwest and therefore collected as much as they could afford, then fulfilled their ultimate dream to share it all with the public in 1929.

Most people don't realize it because not much is taught about them, but our native Indians were so creative and amazing people who had such an artist's heart and desire to express themselves and the Heard really shows their work off to the highest degree. There are 39,000 items of cultural and fine art, including drawings, painting and sculpture. Of all of the possibilities to see when you visit, the core of the collection includes 500 simply incredible Hopi katsini dolls that were on loan from the exclusive Goldwater and Harvey Companies. Ritualistic, religious, complex and often hidden meanings are withheld in each individual katsini and I love them for their mystery. Another exhibit that I love because I am just a big kid is the full-sized Navajo Hogan, the Hopi piki room, the Yaqui ramada and the Pueblo oven. Maybe someday I can sneak in and stay over night.

So, in summary, if you ever visit Phoenix, you have to go to both the Heard and the PAM plus the Taliesin West (I always spell that wrong) building by Frank Lloyd Wright. It isn't all pools, spas, baseball and golf after all."
1,"I needed a place to crash for the night on a drive from Carlsbad Caverns to L.A., I made this booking while I was driving. I stayed here a few years ago and it seemed decent enough. This time it was not. When we got to our room my wife found dead roaches in the bathroom. Big ones too! I went to the front desk to let them know, they tried to give me another room. I told him that I wanted to check out instead. Didn't give me a refund since I booked through expedia. I didn't care, there was no way i was staying in this roach motel. I would rather drive the 370 miles home instead of sleeping in this place. Fortunately I found a Red Roof Inn a few miles down the road for the same price. No roaches there."
1,A wash may be better priced than others but you'll get what you pay for. My husband brought out 2008 Prius for a wash and vacuum and it doesn't look like anything has been cleaned! The carpet in the hatch and floors are still dirty and none of the interior was wiped down. We will be going to Octopus or we'll just do it ourselves next time.
5,"I am a total sucker for quaint bungalow style homes.  (I used to own one, a Sears Bungalow, 1920.)  So this adorable bar/lounge had me as soon as I walked onto the wraparound porch and into the front door.  I could smell the character.  This is a wonderful venue for a date, or, in my case, for a small group of friends to gather.  It has ambiance and then some!

You know that friend of yours who has the great cocktail parties?  That is what it feels like here when the bartender asks for your order.  No positioning to get to him, no yelling your order to him.  He's right there...all for you.

Wow.  I am getting nostalgic here, so let me close with these couple of important details:  1) The wine selection was small but the wines were good, and 2) the cheese/cracker/olive food pairings were quite good.

I left feeling that I had just had a wonderful experience.  Interestingly, there is a bar/lounge in Raleigh, North Carolina that I still remember fondly, years later, because it gave me that same feeling.

I cannot wait for the opportunity to return."
5,"Had an amazing time seeing Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West here on Tuesday. It was my first time at US Airways Center and I will definitely be back if any other artist I enjoy comes to perform. I used the park and ride on Washington just a few blocks East and rode the light rail free about 45 minutes before doors opened. Once inside the lobby I must have dropped my ticket because I had them in my pocket, (don't like bringing a purse to concerts!) and within a minute or two of talking to one of the security guards and an employee at the front another woman came up that worked there and when she found out I had dropped my tickets she told me she picked them up and put them in the back inside the customer relations office. She walked me back and I had my drivers license out that had my name that matched the one on the ticket and without any questions she checked the names, handed them to me, and I was on my way! Talk about total perfection from the staff. That will teach me to use something other than tiny jean pockets next time! 

The seats had a perfect view, section 105 row 19, and we got to look right down at the stage and had a lot of room to dance as we were on the end of the aisle. The show was outrageous and a great experience all around. 

A few small side notes, the bathrooms are huge and clean. The food all smelled pretty tasty but I was not in the mood to stand and eat, and I'm sure it wasn't cheap either. Drinks were priced a bit high but I was driving so I didn't have to worry about opening my wallet anyways! Once the show let out it took a matter of seconds to exit the building and get to the light rail station to go back to my car. I guess a lot of people had the same idea because at least 100 or more of us were waiting in a huge group, and once it arrived and the doors opened we were squishing in but everyone was still on such a high from the exciting show that we were laughing about it.

Thanks for the great night US Airways!"
1,"Blah, worst coffee ever. Had this place 2 weeks ago and I will never come back. Their drip coffee tasted watered down, overpriced and it was by far the shittiest coffee I have ever had. I would much rather get my coffee from AM/PM then ever walk into this place again. Horrible."
1,"Jordans has been closed for 3-4 years now. Much to my dissapointment because I always enjoyed going here for lunch and getting their tostadas.

RIP Jordans."
1,"I took a turntable in to.have them adjust the tonearm settings.  They told me it would take a week for an estimate.  A week later I was told it would be another week.  A week later they said they would take three more days. When I stated the constant delays were unacceptable he got extremely angry and told me in a rude tone to pick up my turntable since they had someone die. I started to explain that I was not aware of their situation, but before I could he hung up on me. It turned out that a tech had died and they were short handed.  I would have understood if they had explained and not been totally rude.  In fact I had a tragedy involving my son the same day.  I went in to talk to them to explain That I was not aware of their situation and was only concerned by the constant delays.  The manager said that I had been abusive and had used foul language with the tech which was a total lie.  He said based that on what the tech had told him. I will never use this company again. Their customer service is lacking."
1,"They don't seem to care about our business. They botched our delivery because they thought they didn't have the stones, even though they did.  They were rude, unhelpful, and about an hour and a half late.  They didn't think any of this was a problem.

We'll try one other local place. We have about $10k in landscaping lined up, but if the local guys are all this indifferent to small orders, I won't trust them with the large ones. Marvel certainly isn't getting a second chance."
5,"Best gym in the area.

I have been a member of 3 different gyms in the Madison area and none have impressed me like Prairie Athletic Club. The facilities are clean, staff is friendly and efficient, and they have great equipment!

I love the different workout areas - there are several rooms with cardio and weights equipment so you can find your favorite spot, or rotate through them all of a change of scenery. There are several pools, both indoor and out, saunas in the locker rooms, and a hot tub.

The group fitness classes are offered at several times throughout the day, so it's easy to find a class & time that fit your schedule. Classes are only included with the most expensive membership, but it is so worth it. The membership is very affordable, especially compared to other gyms that I've tried where you get much less for almost the same price."
1,"I flagged the ""doctors"" reply.  It is filled with lies, as it would be.  I have nothing to gain by making false statements.  He has $$$$$  to lose if people heed my warning and avoid his practice.  I have proof from THREE other vets that his diagnosis was WRONG.  If my dog had blood in her eye, it would be there the next day, too.  I took her to a chiropractic  vet in AZ the next day.  After adjusting her, he looked in her eye with an instrument.  NO BLOOD.  
Plus, Bishop  did not bother to look at my dog, or check her over in any way.  NOTHING.  NADA.   He just announced very DIRE supposed concerns that required IMMEDIATE and EXPENSIVE procedures in HIS OFFICE, without any initial exam, or even listening to me about her history. All of this based on the fact that she was coughing.  He completely ignored my every word.  It is true she was knocked by a bigger (not huge, about 10 lb.) dog.  Yet he ignored that, until his rebuttal now.  He did not look at her little back or legs, etc., to see if they were sore or bruised,.  After I took her to the chiropractor in AZ (who sadly isn't on Yelp, as he is expensive but SUPERB and worth every penny) she was much better.  I also was concerned about the Flovent she was on and the Dr. in CA (who also checked her eye WITH AN INSTRUMENT unlike Bishop) said she was having a reaction to it.  In Fact, Bishop said he knows NOTHING about Flovent and then ignored my concern about it.  So it's odd he brings it up now.  He just kept yelling how she's obviously in heart failure.    It nauseates me that some vets do this to loving pet parents, esp. when their baby is getting older and they get more concerned.  But as I said, as a rescuer, I'm a pro at this by now, and know when I'm being given a grotesque sales pitch.   I give good reviews when they're warranted.  I have NO reason not to. BTW, I'd been to the office of the ""specialist"" he was going to refer me to (read my review on the Vet. Specialists in Gilbert).  NO THANKS.  And the other ""specialist""  was at another office I'd been to.  They wanted to put my dog UNDER (yes, anesthesia) to take a STICKER out of her leg.  What?  ""Well, because poking with a needle, to pop it out hurts"".  Oh, so when you give a shot to a dog, you put them under for that, too?  Obviously birds of a feather stick together."
1,"I travel a good deal.  This is the worst hotel experience, by far.

This is an older Embassy Suites but I thought that its location in the tony Biltmore area of Phoenix would assure that it's well-kept.  Incorrect assumption.  This is the filthiest hotel I've ever seen.

I should have known I was in for utter disappointment when I arrived for my stay around 12:45 am.  I am dead tired and fumbling with two bags when I happen upon a security guard standing in front of the hotel taking a smoke.  Instead of holding the door for me, he watched me balance my bags and purse with an amused grin, as I struggled with the the hotel door.  Thanks for nothing.  I get to the front desk and the check-in process is fairly smooth.  I'm booked into a room that is on a far end of the hotel.  I hike over there and proceed to get ready for bed when more problems ensue. The bathroom wall has what appears to be a streak of blood running down it.  I was too grossed out to investigate further.  There is also a bent wire hanger on the picture frame over the toilet.  The wallpaper is peeling and the ceiling is showing signs of a bad leak from upstairs.  Really?  I am appalled at this point but since it's after 1 am, I reason that I can just get a little shut-eye and change rooms first thing in the morning.  My plans quickly changed when I turned down the bed covers to find lint and make-up on them.  I can't do this.  I call the front desk and request an immediate room change.  The lady I spoke too was extremely apologetic and offered to move me right away.  She said she'd send up a security guard to help with my bags and get me into a better room/area of the hotel.  You know where this is going, right?  Yes, approximately 10 minutes later the grinning smoker appears at the door.  He hands me a key for a room on the opposite side of the hotel and makes the assessment that I have a pretty good handle on my bags so he'll just point me in the direction of where I should go.  The new room looks exactly like the first one, albeit a little cleaner.  The bathroom looked acceptable and the bed covers were free of foreign substances.  It was past my bedtime, I needed sleep.

With a little rest and fresh eyes, the hotel didn't get any better for me.  I'm sure in its heyday this was THE place to stay.  Sadly, it is just neglected and doesn't warrant the nightly room charges (it's not cheap).  The common areas are filthy.  I promise that I'm not a germaphobe.  I really didn't want to touch anything in this hotel.  The elevator buttons and door handles were dirty.  I had to carry napkins with me so I wouldn't have to touch them.  The carpet in the lobby and elevators looked like a ton of toddlers had had their way with a box of Ritz crackers.  And, no, I didn't catch them on an off day.  It looked like this for my entire three-day stay.  I failed to mention the ceiling fan in my new and improved ""clean"" room.  The dust hanging off of it was so thick.  It clearly hadn't been touched in ages.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel lobby also has an off-putting stench, probably due to the fountains/ponds inside?  I don't know but it's unpleasant.

If the filth wasn't bad enough, on the last day of my stay I was jarred from sleep at 4 am by a blaring fire alarm.  I pulled the curtain back and saw other guests milling about.  Apparently, there is no intercom system to let guests know what they should do.  When I saw another guest return to her room, I took the gamble that I'd burn in this cess pool and went back to bed.  It was a short-lived nap.  A few hours later, the alarm is blaring again!  I'm deliriously tired and in the process of the pulling on a pair of jeans to exit when housekeeping opens the door.  Really?  The alarm is going off,  it's still early in the a.m. and you're coming in the room to clean?  What in the hell?  What do you clean, anyway?  At this point, I knew it was time to part ways.  I quickly packed and made my exit.  Unbelievable and unforgivable.  Never again."
1,"This place has slipped significantly in the past 6 months.  No meat in the rolled tacos, smaller and smaller burritos, same or higher prices.  I would like to direct anyone close by to Armando's on 48th St and Thomas.  Cheaper, better tasting and larger portions.  This Filiberto's has become run-of-the-mill and cheap.  Other good reasons to stay away:  adjacent to a bus stop and a telemarketing joint.  Enough said."
1,"I'm a general contractor and I purchase about 80-100k worth of Lumber per year. 

And I can say without a doubt that the lumber at heldt lumber company is grossly overpriced.
Home Depot has better quality lumber (if you know how to pic it) that is about 40% cheaper on average . 
I chose heldt lumber company because I was under the impression that the wood would be of better quality, boy was I wrong.
Also, if you special order a piece and you notice that it is warped or damaged once you arrive at your work site...too bad for you all sales are final on these items.
I've lost a lot of money and a lot of time dealing with this company, I would strongly advise against shopping there."
5,This place is the best for legit Mexican breakfast.  Machaca and Chilaquilles is very good and so is the enchiladas and napolitos.  I have only been for breakfast but can imagine the other food is amazing as well.
1,"The good:

They were able to book me for a new patient appointment fairly quickly. The front desk guy was very thorough. The staff was friendly.

The bad:

They tried to sell me whitening (multiple times), the dentist told me I needed a crown and potentially a root canal, and many fillings. She insisted I needed a deep clean and would need to book an appointment to get the crown before part of my tooth fell off. I went ahead and got the deep cleaning as it had been a while since my last cleaning. I was skeptical of the other recommendations though, so I drove across the valley to my trustworthy dentist for a second opinion. Turns out that much of the work that the dentist at Weldon recommended was not at all necessary.
On top of that, the office at Weldon looked poorly maintained, with dusty looking countertops and such.
Also, I just got a bill that shows I was charged $55 for ""Oral hygiene instruction"" - which I was NEVER made aware of the fact that I was receiving, or would be charged for, and I was never asked if I wanted it. All it consisted of was the hygienist telling me how to floss (which I already knew), not to use listerine, and then trying to sell me a sonic toothbrush from their office. This is incredibly frustrating that they never told me that the advice was a charged service, as I would have not agreed to it if I was made aware.

If TLDR; * Pushy dentist and hygienist; * Poor facilities; * Unnecessary procedures; * Charged $55 for ""Oral hygiene instruction""  that I never agreed to or knew I was being charged for."
5,"When HRC was on Camelback, we frequented the bar for happy hour.  During that time, we befriended the bartenders, who are still there  They create a neighborhood feel to this international chain.  Phoenix HRC is different than the other ones I've been to because of this.  When they moved downtown we continued to frequent the bar.  Number 1 reason to drive downtown for happy hour - the bartenders Javier and Eddie.  They have incredible memories and pick up the conversation you ended with the last time you were there, and that could have been 8 months ago.  They are quick with the drinks and with their wit. 

The food is ok and over-priced, but that comes with the HRC name.  We have found the entire staff to be friendly and accommodating.  A neighborhood HRC bar...hmmmm.  Sure feels like it."
1,found a cockroach in the bathroom....I just left.
1,This is terrible.  The food is very bland and service is very slow.  The employees act like they're the only restaurant in town.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
5,"Before buying, I had a chance to meet and speak at some length to the founder: Michael Johnson.  To boil down the conversation:  Michael Johnson is truly a ""micro"" roaster, who literally deals one-on-one with the farms, has the bags shipped directly to his commercial location (no middleman) and then sifts the product for the top beans, managing the cut through the roasting process as a science using state of the art computer software next to good old fashioned roasting hardware.  The end product is packaged on site. 

That said, I took all of that with a grain of salt until I tried one of the finished products: the Ethiopian Sidamo Fair Trade.

Wow.  Blew my socks off.  The Ethiopian Sidamo Fair Trade may very well be the best coffee I have ever had.  Unbelievably complex bouquet and flavor: I detected floral and cinnamon notes followed by a crisp, refreshing finish.  On that alone, I ended up buying another four different types from JBC (have yet to try, but cannot wait to do so).  

As a good blend will run you $18-$24 a pound in the Bay Area, I consider JBC's prices down right competitive.  I can only hope my finished brew tastes the way Michael's preparation did.  %&* great coffee.  Period."
5,"Love love love this place! Seriously, a place in Phoenix that is locally owned, has great prices, great food and buys local is pretty hard to find. My favorite wrap is the Gardin'n salad as a wrap. My only complaints about this place are the hours and the parking! But still well worth it."
1,I created a yelp account to write this review.  I came in for a trim that I had scheduled the day before.  Only one stylist working and no receptionist.  After waiting for her to finish up with her client the stylist informed me I had no appointment.  She checked the computer we found my name written under the wrong day and time.  She was not very apologetic for my inconvenience and nothing was offered to me to insure my return.   I will advise my friends and family not to visit this salon.
5,Always have great service.  Feel like my eyes are checked very thoroughly.
5,"I love coming here I think it's one of the hidden gems of the city. There are great restaurants. But mostly I love the scenery . They have done a wonderful job of creating a tranquil environment. I consider this a great place to change and be alone and read , snap I grew photos  for fun, and even a good place to prolong a date. As you walk into this amazing courtyard there  is a fountain, a lot of lit trees, flowers, benches, and soft modern contemporary music playing in the background. Bring a date here and all the work of ambiance is done for you."
1,"We are adding onto our kitchen and went here to get cabinets and countertops to match our current cabinets. 

We worked with a lady (Penni maybe?) for about an hour and she said she would draw up a quote and get back to us that evening. After we didn't hear from her in a week we gave her a call and were put on hold, she said she didn't get to it because she was working on some 'really big' projects (ours wasn't big enough to pay attention to apparently).  When she finally got back on the line she changed her story and said that our information was now lost but she would find it and call us right back. That was two weeks ago and we haven't heard from her since. Unfortunately they were the only dealer in Madison who carried the cabinets we have and we will now have to go out of town to get our cabinets/countertops"
5,"Wow. Amazing authentic Mexican. Its the real thing. No frills, super casual, just damn good food. 

Theres also a Mexican grocer in the back to check out with all the real goods to take home and cook."
1,"I'm kind of curious about the abandoned looking truck in the parking lot with biohazard symbols all over it. What I at first thought was a condom on the floor of the room turned out to be a discarded stocking. The drain in the shower/bathtub doesn't work. There was some cool garbage in the parking lot along with the biohazard truck, and some pretty haggard looking folks wandering around the premises. The only perks are the free wifi that I'm currently using to write this review and the fact that they're currently showing Training Day on MTV and Training Day is an awesome movie."
1,We tried to order for delivery because we are 4 miles away. On their menu it says $15 minimum. We called to place the order and we were told today it's a $75 minimum. We found that insane so never ordered.
5,"Oh little Korean woman, how I love you so.  You are absolutely adorable and did not realize that the man wig I was looking for was for me.  I absolutely loved the look on your face when you realized I was going to be dressing as a man for Halloween.  I know you cater to all the drag queens, but I guess you are not used to it being the other way around.  Nevertheless you were extremely helpful and took no time at all to pick out the perfect Charlie wig.  You even showed me how to put it on, all while laughing in disbelief that I would hide all my pretty hair and try to doll it up like a man.  Prices were great for the quality of hair that you are buying, and they have all this fabulous costume jewelry and eyelashes to complete the drag queen look.  I will definitely hit this place up when going to a theme party."
5,"The BBQ pork is fantastic but here's their best kept secret .... 

CATFISH YUM! 

This location serves Catfish fillets on Thursday and Friday. I wish it was everyday! They use a deliciously seasoned cornmeal NO flour! It is light and crisp and my fav! It is served with a great hot sauce and sweet moist dinner rolls. Fries and Cow-bro beans go great but you have your choice of sides. If you love a good catfish in cornmeal, I dare you to find any better in this town without making it yourself. I give Honey Bears 10 stars for their catfish **********. I grew up in the Midwest and we had catfish almost every Friday and this tastes just like home. 

Trust you will not regret this fish!"
1,"Not impressed. Dropped a tablecloth for a work event off here and was told would take two weeks because of the size.  Seems a bit long but this is the first time I've left a non-clothing item anywhere so, ok. 
Called day before expected date of completion to confirm and was told it would be ready at 5pm and I said I'd be by the next am. 
I roll in and it's not done!  Pointing fingers and asking who I spoke to?  Didn't think to ask unless I was told it wasn't going to be ready.  Woman was apologetic. Writing this review in the parking lot while they press it. It was just going to be washed in cold water, hung to dry and pressed. No cost taken off the $30."
1,"Hillstone: you are overrated. You think you are better than you are. Every time I go, I am disappointed and my friends say we are never coming back. 
We sure miss Houston's in the Biltmore. You tried, but it's not the same. 
There are so many great places in Phoenix. Hillstone is good. Not great."
1,"""My wife and I ate there a few weeks back, I thought the atmosphere was quaint and inviting however after we were sat it took quite some time before our waiter came back to us for anything. I found him to be unwelcoming and inattentive the 2 Hispanic helpers were much more courteous and attentive. The food was Ok  it wasn't horrible but i would not write home about it. It was my fist time there and maybe it was an off night but i would be reluctant to recommend the place to a friend or return simply because the service was horrible. I do how however like ambiance."
1,"I stayed at this hotel and it was nice. However, I left my sunglasses behind (they were a special gift from my younger sister) and I called on the same day to see if they had them. They said that they would call back with an update. But they never did. Just a note do not leave anything behind because you will not get it back or even a simple phone call."
1,Me and the Mrs were looking for a place to kill some time while waiting to catch a plane home from Az. So we figured we would look on Yelp for a mall to stroll through. We came across the Arizona Center an saw it was near the airport so we figured we would give it a shot. What a let down! This place is far from what I consider a mall or even a strip mall. A few whack ass stores and some meager restaurants. To top it off we had to pay to park there. Lame! Won't be wasting our time here again.
5,I finally managed to make my way here after years of saying I would! Love the atmosphere in there. It's so...eccentric! And the food was good. Totally did not know you get a free dessert afterwards! Spumoni icecream was great. Win win situation :D
1,"My very first review - my dark blue car ruined on the exterior.  Couldn't see it until I returned home and the sunlight revealed exterior body scratches.  Evidently they didn't take care to use clean rags/towels.  Looks like a Brillo pad was used.  Going back tomorrow to see if we can get this rectified.

Well, I'll keep my review the same.  Took my car in this morning to see what could be done.  A ""charming"" older woman (JOVEL) came out to tell me this was definitely not caused by them an it was without a doubt caused by a buffer.  I explained to her that a buffer had not touched my car since it was last detailed by European Detail over six months ago.  To my face she told me I was not providing the truth and if I took it to a BMW dealership they would also confirm I was ""lying"".

Guess what!!  BMW confirmed that the damage was likely caused by rags because of the linear motion that was apparent.  Rick was the gentleman from Los Olivos who accompanied me.  When he also learned that perhaps I wasn't lying as JOVEL had certainly alleged he offered a re-wash and a had wax to correct the problem.  Thank you Rick for obeing a professional.  

Even upon return to the Wash JOVEL was still had her heals dug in refusing to acknowledge any error on their part. 

Although the business has taken a turn to rectify it was like pulling teeth or pleading a case before the the Supreme Court.  Not acceptable.  

Again kudos to Rick as a gentleman and professional.  If this was his site alone I could raise my review substantially."
5,"This is truly a beautiful place and a treasure for Madison.  Please don't ever leave us.  Be sure to check out the herb garden in the fall.  Amazing variety of scents.  The varieties of  geranium are amazing.  Lemon, chocolate, mint, vanilla, pepper, cinnamon, turmeric... well you get the picture."
1,"The only reason I put one star is because I had to. One of the poorest managed and run motels that I have ever seen. The rooms were very sub-par with mold on the bathroom ceiling. There were crumbs in the bed and they weren't very clean.

The rooms' walls were very thin and you could hear everything that went on from people stomping around upstairs to listening to doors banging constantly. There was a ton  of noise from these places as well as the highway running parallel to the hotel as well as adjoining rooms.

Management was the worst of all. Horrible at enforcing the rules so other guests can be very discourteous as well as riff raff running around outside peeking into locked vehicles almost as if they were trying to find a way to break in. Head manager is very hard to understand as he doesn't speak English clearly with no common sense on how to run a business.

Overall, one of the poorest run hotels I have seen in a long time and for the money, many other choices in the area which provide way better service and accommodations. So overall, easy to make a better choice anywhere else. Beware."
5,"Homestyle cooking at its best, dnt go to culvers, McDonald's or whatever trash is right off the hwy, head a bit further down u will find this gem, one of the reasons I love this place so much? They dnt play annoying music, scratch that, they don't play ANY music. People working here are super nice as to be expected. If I owned this joint, I would invest in a new bigger sign, as I drove right by this place and almost missed it twice."
1,"This place should just shut down.  Went for drinks before the TOOL concert and they had 4 people working...REALLY?  Waiting for 10 minutes at the bar, gave up and went inside, waited for another 15, nothing...They didn't even have tub girls set up....Bad planning.  We went down the street to cooperstown and although they were slammed, they had servers and we were able to get beverages before the show,  I would never go back to jackson's again."
1,"UPDATE 

Roaches are still present anywhere there is a drain.  There's nothing more exciting than opening your dish washer to see Roaches climbing all over your newly cleaned dishes.  

There's also a new bug running around, looks like a carpet Beetle steroids.  

I failed to mention the ""gated community"" which is basically two gates that are set to be open the bulk of the day and close at night. That's all there is to it.  Anyone can walk in off the street as there are no other fences or gates.  I see black people digging through the garbage as I leave very early in the morning.  

Overall I think I've seen these gates work a total of like 3 weeks in the last year.  They broke as they always do and haven't been fixed in months so someone finally comes to fix it and both sides of the gate are running at different times and speeds.   By the end of that first day both sets of gates are broken and not moving at all again.  Nothing new here."
5,"The donuts are amazing and super-fattening of course, but then I guess you shouldn't be eating donuts if you are concerned with your weight.

I agree it is by far the best gyros in town, I am originally from Chicago and am used to the quality of gyros found all over Chicagoland, this is cut the same, same thickness, same style, the flavor is similar, but has it's own thing going on. Either way, that Parthenon in Madison is crap, people rave about it, what a joke, they have no clue what good gyros is, take a road trip and go eat at Hubs in Chicago, then you will know finally what great gyros is. In the meantime, if you are stuck in Madison, this is by far the best you will find, don't waste your money and calories elsewhere.

Falafel is good, has it's own unique recipe, works for me.

Tan Tan Chicken is very good too, highly spiced, which I like, although not spicy as far as heat is concerned. Comes with an awesome garlic dip, which I've only found in Los Angeles at Zankou Chicken, which by the way is the most incredible middle-eastern chicken ever. They even made a ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" episode about it in 2011. If you get out to LA ever, you must go to Zankou and get the Chicken Tarna with the garlic dip, the hummus is also the best ever. Almost enough to make me want to move back to LA. In fact...

Anyway, People's Bakery is truly a gem in Madison, amongst all the questionable eateries, which some say are great, others say bad, this one is clearly a huge winner. And it is a real Mom & Pop, literally they made all the food for me, super friendly, down to Earth, real people who deserve to have your business. Go there now!

P.S. I also liked a bunch of other stuff there, the hummus, side dishes, veggie mezza, etc. Probably can't go wrong with anything there."
1,"This place epitomizes the gaff between gay and lesbian culture. If you have a penis, don't expect to be treated like an equal even if you're not competition. What you should expect are a bunch of glares as soon as you walk through the door. The staff will tolerate you, but won't be friendly. No less than 5 people will cut you because after all, this is their turf and you don't belong there.

Don't sit at a table, because ""this table is taken"" even if there's no one sitting there and their aren't any beverages on it.

I won't be going back."
1,This place used to be really good. They made the best tacos (which they don't make anymore) and green chili. The green chili has gone down hill you can tell they are cutting corners. They have raised their prices which is completely unjustified due to the quality going down. This place has now become nothing more than an eye sore and nuisance to the local neighborhood. Close your doors and move on.
1,"Went there for lunch today, sat at a high top table by the bar. Host was not very personable, but we gave it a chance. Wrong idea. We waited 15 min, not even a greet or anything. We seen all sorts of servers walk by our table, ignoring us. After waiting, we got up and left. All the host said was ""leaving already?"" Really?! He said it in a tone as if he wanted to know if the table was now 'available'. Will never I back. I am not the biggest fan of Applebee's, and this just sealed the deal. Get it together people."
1,"Stopped in for a beer after the game last night, the place looked run down and very blah.  There was maybe a handful of people sitting at the bar and the bartender walked by us probably 4 times without saying anything.  Served the guests next to us and still didn't greet my group.
He made a comment about the Phillies hat  I was wearing and walked past(he had a braves hat on). We got up and left after about 10 mins went by.  The ""New"" Jacksons on 3rd is worse than the old Jacksons, no wonder it closed.  Cant see it staying open too long."
5,"Great place, great food, and a beautiful environment.  Friendly family owned place, good prices, lots of great options.  Could eat here every day of the week!"
1,"Apparently, I've been on yelp since 2009 and never written a review; Well here it goes: If yelp had a negative star rating it would be a negative 10!!!  I bought my husbands ""platinum""  wedding band here last April and found out today that they gave me a 14k white gold band; Thank god for Molinas and their honesty. The story doesn't stop here, they wouldn't even get a manager to help my husband until I got there, and their computer system was down.  They cant tell me anything til Monday!!! I hope nobody else has been duped.  Beware!  I feel cheated and very appalled that this happened.  This story isn't over, so let's see how much worse it can get..."
5,"If you are craving a massive bar burger from a towny bar, this is the place to go. 
The burgers are so large that you should plan on cutting it in half and take the other half home. They are excellent!
If you order the bacon burger, you can expect at least 6 plus long stripes on bacon on it, I was completely amazed with the quantity and quality of the burger. Amazing. 

I have also been to the Eagle Crest on Taco Tuesday. Prepare yourself for the largest taco you will ever see. If you order the taco salad they give you a very large plate stacked high with chips and all the fixings. It's great. More than any one person can eat in one sitting. 

This is a bar people! Don't expect proper waitress service, the bar tenders are serving you most of the time. Just be happy that this particular bar has amazing food. 

Since this is a bar, maybe the best Bloody Mary in town. It comes in a large mug with 2 huge shrimp, a beef stick, pickle, and green olives. A meal in itself. 

If your hungry and don't want to spend a lot of money, this is the place I would suggest.
My new favorite bar."
1,"This is where you go to get wrecked............ by cheese.  If you like cheese A LOT, you can order any of their delicious combos smothered in ooey, gooey, creamy, warm cheese.  

Is there actually any real food underneath the gigantic blobs of cheese?  Strap on a portable oxygen tank and dive in to find out!

In the 1988 film ""The Blob,"" an evil life form goes around eating people, only at Laredo's you can finally get yer revenge and eat the blob...............if you dare!

5,"Huge thanks to Bavarian Motors for the fantastic job restoring my poor Mini-S. We've been long-time satisfied customers for routine maintenance and wear-out replacements, but this was a definite stretch.   

The damage was extensive, yet they went to great pains to get every detail right - duplicating wherever possible the custom features originally chosen.  I love my Mini, and they understood the connection.  They worked successfully with the insurance adjuster and settlement was equitable and fast.

Most of all, the kindness and concern shown for me was amazing.  Andrew went out of his way to make sure I had not been injured, and more than once comforted me with the statement, ""People are what's important, not cars."" 

I have to agree: the people at Bavarian Motors are the draw- the great service and repair grow out of their care and concern for everything they do.  

My car looks magnificent and runs like a charm!

Thanks guys!"
5,"Ranch Market rocks!  I swear, this is the coolest place, it's like a big Mexican circus.  I could hang out in there for hours.

The best deal that I've found there is the roasted chicken.  For about five dollars, you get a whole roasted chicken, some tortillas, and some salsa.  Buy a little cheese, an onion, and some sour cream and you've got yourself a little taco bar to take home and eat with some Dos Equis.  Sweet!  Since I'm all about the bargains these days, this is one of the best places to go!

A definite five stars as far as I'm concerned!"
5,This flower shop and garden supply center is just beautiful. Friendly staff that take a moment to answer your questions. The best selection of new indoor and outdoor plants in the mad city area.
5,"Wow. Currently in a chilaquile-induced coma. Been here a few times and I'm finally getting around to writing a review. It's smoky, kinda loud, with a butcher, bakery, market, and restaurant all in one. Today is the first time I've seen fellow gringos here, it must be catching on!

Make sure to try the habanero salsa and chilaquiles. I insist! The chicken ones are the best in my opinion. It's probably enough for two people to share as a meal (or if you're a glutton like me you can eat the whole thing by yourself and be miserable). Also had the bacon breakfast torta today--amazing! Kept stealing bites from my dining partner in crime. have yet to be disappointed by anything here but the chilaquiles are definitely what I come for."
5,"This is a gem of a jewelry store located in downtown Phoenix! The owners and staff are all incredibly friendly, knowledgeable and very attentive. This store has a wonderful atmosphere, a very local and family-owned type of feeling. 

The selection is not as big as a mall jewelry store, however, it is obvious that they know what sells, and carry only that. They have a wide selection of precious gemstones (including sapphires and tanzanite), set in earrings, pendants and rings.

They also offer a good selection of wedding band sets, and in designs that are both unique and timeless. 

In addition to their fine jewelry they also offer costume and sterling silver jewelry as well as assorted trinkets and home decor. 

I came in to have a pin put back into a watch and the service I received was phenomenal! They were able to repair the watch within minutes and at very minimal cost... literally next to nothing! 

It is nice to see a local jewelry store going above and beyond to help their customers! This is what makes a local store so much better than a chain store, and you know that your jewelry is in good hands here. 

Finally, they are very low pressure. This is an ideal location to stop in for a cleaning or repair... then you can check out all of their pretty merch! Cannot recommend this jewelry store enough!"
5,"My husband and I brought my nephew here for something fun to do.  What I really enjoyed about the place is that it's pretty hands-on and caters to kids (but is still pretty fun for us adults too).  I came in here thinking that my husband would love it but my nephew and I would be bored.... but I was also under the impression that it was museum-esque with a lot of ""look but don't touch"" exhibits.  I was very happy that this wasn't the case :)

At the end of the day my nephew even wanted to stay longer which was awesome.  It's fun for everyone :)"
1,I tried this today. Bout the same as Filibertos and I always feel really bad after eating it. Just like today. Heartburn and just uck. Not good.
5,"No more mr nice guy pasta. Get it, enough said. 

They also have the big unit (huge hot dog) and good burgers.

Food is excellent and quick. Dont come here to drink, but go there to drink and eat."
5,Paul was an awesome waiter..  Very friendly professional and took pride in what he appears to love doing..  Food was fantastic too..  Thank you Paul
1,"La Bamba where the burritos are as big as your head.  I suppose this would be true if I had Beetlejuice's head after he gets it shrunken by the voodoo guy.  They aren't as big as your head, so if you go in there thinking you are going to nosh on a seriously huge burrito, you are going to be let down.  Just when you think ""oh well, maybe it'll at least taste good,"" you find out the disappointing truth, the burritos are bland and full of dry rice.  Booooo!  The path to gigantic burrito enlightenment is not here my friends, just keep on drivin' by."
1,Went to Denny's this morning for breakfast with my twins and fiance. We walked in the door and their was no hostess which is understandable if they are busy but they really weren't. We had at least five servers look dead at us as well as cooks and stood there for a good five minutes and still no one said anything to us so we walked out and went to the McDonald's across the street.
1,"We have a contest going on at work. We choose a type of food we like, then go out and find 5 different restaurants to try that type of food from. Whichever restaurant we rank highest is where we'll go when we're in the mood for that type of food. There are 4, sometimes 5 of us so the winning restaurants get a nice sale each time we go out. I let the cashiers/owners know about our contest up front so they know we'll be back (plenty) if they win. We've done Gyros (Z's Greek wins), Burgers (Chicago Hamburger Company wins), and now we're doing hard shell tacos.  

Today we tried Rosita's place. I walked in and let the lady know about our contest. She asked what restaurants we planned to try then mentioned that we shouldn't include franchise restaurants because their food will be cheap and sub-par and cannot touch a family restaurant like hers. I appreciated her opinion. 

I started my order by asking if I could substitute one of the ground beef tacos in the combination plate for chicken and was given an emphatic NO. She said it costs them extra for the meat so it was only fair to charge us extra. So, I kindly paid an extra 2.50 to get a machaca and chicken taco in my combo and continued the order. I asked for mild salsa with one pair of tacos and was told ""we have red and green and everyone will get both"". 4 of us ordered a total of 8 tacos, 1 combination plate, and an order of chips and salsa. Total sale was around 33 bucks.  

I get back to the office and hand out the food and this is when we realized that we got CHIPS AND HOT SAUCE, not Chips and Salsa which was a very unpleasant surprise. Many of the chips were chewy and soggy and we threw most of the bag away because of this. I expected white meat in my 3.00 chicken tacos but received dark, greasy meat. I thought a family restaurant will always provide quality meat?? The machaca was so overloaded with grease that the lettuce turned gray and slimy and the hard taco turned soft and mushy. I literally had to POUR the grease out. The chicken was flavorless and we didn't get cheese on any of the tacos. Let me guess, only fair they charge extra for cheese?? 

Not all of our tacos were as bad as mine but we all expected better flavor, cheese on our tacos, white-meat chicken, the ability to mix and match taco choices, and salsa with our chips; after all, a family restaurant will always be better quality than a franchise, RIGHT? The beans and rice were pretty good and while I do like my hot sauce hot I feel they substitute flavor with spice. 

All in all, I give Rosita's Place 3 out of 1000 stars (for the rice and beans and that's sad). I also found it offensive and absurd that they would openly slam on franchise restaurants when a Filiberto's or Chipotle taco blows the doors off of Rosita's Place. All of us agreed that this place would be at the bottom of the list come time to choose a winner. This is obviously not saying any other entree they have is just as bad; I'm only discussing their tacos. I was waiting all week to get some good tacos and am highly disappointed. It's safe to say I will never go to this restaurant again."
1,"This place is pretty gross.  It's dirty.  The gas station it's attached to need a massive overhaul.  The employees are sketchy-looking at best.  Have some standards, Arby's."
1,"Don't waste your money here, the service is very poor, and the food is pathetic. Our party of 9 came here on a Wednesday afternoon around 5:30PM. They were not very busy, only a couple other tables with people were in the restaurant area, I thought I'd like to try a new place, what a disappointment! Should have went across the street to SanTan Brewery for decent food and service. We were served our drinks in a timely manner while looking at the food menu, so far, all good. BUT, after waiting about 20 minutes and two drinks, the waitress had still not returned to take our food order, so, I went to the bar area, found her to let her know we wanted to order some food, she was nice, came over quickly and took our orders. AFTER NEARLY AN HOUR of waiting and watching several tables of newly arriving people, be served, eat, and leave, I was very frustrated, and spoke to the manager lady about it. She acted quickly, within 5 minutes our food began to arrive. My pizza crust was raw and tasted like home made glue using flour and water, my sister's pizza was the same way. Between my mother's wedge salad leaves was brown rotten leaves, and my daughter's wedge salad was the same way, that was gross. I showed the gross food to the manager, and told her and the waitress how the service was terrible and the food wasn't fit to eat. They removed the pizza's and salad's from our checks, we won't be back! I don't think the place will be there to go back to anyway if that is the norm for them, so sad!"
1,"I dealt with Roxy.  I scheduled an appointment for her to come to my house to measure and bring me some samples.  On the day of the appointment she called to tell me that she did not have the samples with her but she did want to come by and measure and see the other flooring in my house to try and match.  When she got to my house, she kept mentioning a tile which looked like wood- which I told her specifically that I did not want tile.
Then when she told me her pricing ($3/sq ft) for installation.  I told her that she was double the price of others.  She explained that her company has to hire a subcontractor and then still make a profit.  So- they are basically a middle man.  
She then stated that she would come back the next day and bring some samples.  She never showed up or called.  Very unprofessional.  
My suggestion is to eliminate the middle man and find someone who installs themselves."
1,"The room was not clean.  The hotel manager was extremely rude and aggressive.  

Simply put, don't stay here.  For the same money, you can do a lot better."
1,"If I could give them zero stars I would. Worst customer service experience of my life. They completely defrauded me. I got the wrong sized belt so I wanted to exchange it with one that was slightly bigger. Keep in mind that the item had been purchased the day before and had never been worn. The lady went to the back for like ten minutes - and when she came out she said she couldn't exchange my item because someone had put a hole in my belt to make it even smaller (which doesn't make sense because the belt was too small to begin with). Clearly, she went in the back and put a hole in it herself. Maybe this is how the corporate Gucci office tries to eliminate exchanges and returns."
5,"My new fav!! :) We have to go down town about once a week, and we always end up eating bad food, but I wanted something healthy, and I noticed That's A Wrap. I ordered the Price of Thai or something like that on Monday and it was great. Both the Hubby and I were down town on Wednesday and we were starving, so we went back and he got the buffalo 66 and I got the Who's the Turkey, ooohhhh my gosh they were AWESOME! the buffalo 66 could cure my hardcore wing cravings and I have not stopped wanting another Who's the Turkey! I am going to go down the line and try every wrap every time I get to go!"
1,"this is my first 1 star review


it used to be that i could place an internet order and instantly know that it would be correctly done to my specifications in the time that i requested it in.
Recently:  i don't know who the buffoon's are that the now ""fedex kinko's""
hired, but the last three orders i put in not only sucked, it took
decades for these people to find and although i left my phone number in bold for them to call if there were any questions, they sent me three emails instead of calling me
. 
whooo i ask you sits at their inbox waiting for a response from kinkos?
these people are idiots.
i will be going to the washington one from now on."
5,"Blue plate omelette was delish, with avocado, pan fried potatoes and homemade biscuits. We also had the almond milk French toast. To top it off, local coffee, ground fresh with each pot! Must stop again."
1,"Would love to give more stars but what a cheapass place.  Ordered a milkshake at 7:59, by the time it arrived it was after 8:00. They are offering their half price shakes after 8:00. Even though it was delivered after 8:00 they wouldn't give it to me at half price because I ordered it one minute too soon.  I hate lazy workers who don't want to be bothered making things right for a customer."
5,"I love this place--- just walking through Red makes me feel like I am in a time warp.  It's so chic and cool.  I instantly needed a dirty martini (extra olives please!) and a ciggy.  

We found some really great pieces we liked that would work perfectly in our home.  And some we fell in LOVE with other stuff but have not purchased.  It is pricey but they are like pieces of fine art.  It is Eames-era heaven.  There is the most beautiful desk I have ever seen and other pieces that just left me in awe.  If this is your style, you need to go to Red."
1,"Mu Shu was closed so we gave this place a try for takeout. Sundays and Asian food, I know. I'm Asian.

Currently suffering worst food poisoning in this decade, the kind that tears your back up from violent heaving.

Don't get chicken."
5,"This bar had become something of a second home to me on Monday nights for the 2.5 years we lived in Madison.  During most of the week it's a nice blue collar hangout, but on Monday's it keeps the blue collar drink pricing, but adds some of the best live funk and soul music to be found in the midwest.  Also check out Wednesday nights for the open jam session they have weekly.   Best beer on tap? Moose Drool hands down."
1,"Does anyone in Madison consider this a great Mexican food location? Both of my experiences at Pedro's have left me disheartened. They go a little something like this:

1. Thursday night. Friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas. Am   approached by a girl who wants me to go out with her father standing 10 feet away, who ironically is the least creepy of the crowd looking to enjoy cheap tequila. Implementing Gym Rules, i.e. baseball cap and hoodie upon my next visit post 9pm.

2. Wednesday evening. Dinner with a friend. Server who may or may not go on living if she stops texting, poor quality food and terrible lighting, which is imperative unless practicing G.R. (see above.)

Being a girl from the southwest, I have had a great fajita or two in my day. If you are feeling rebellious and decide to go despite the many poor reviews, know this: Mexican food is great, and this is nowhere near that."
1,"I would not recommend taking your pet to this hospital. My dog went in for ACL repair and died. Dr. Ferrera called after the surgery to tell me my dog was fine and everything was great. I could pick her up in a few hours.
An hour and a half later he called back to say my dog had stopped breathing and he brought her back but she now had brain damage and would never be the same if in fact she pulled through.
After seeing my dog it was clear I would have to put her down. I was told they would call me when they had her ashes back in about a week.
Two weeks later and with no call I went in only to be treated with absolutely no compassion what so ever. The girl at the front desk acted like see had never seen me before even though I have been going there for 12 years. She then went to the back and brought out a little black container which she plopped on the counter and said, ""here you go have a nice day.""
I will never step foot in that place again."
5,"I'm not reviewing this place as a bowling alley, since I don't have the expertise to know what constitutes a good bowling experience.  If the shoes fit, the ball rolls down the lane, and the pins fall down, it's fine.

This review is all about the food.  Which, if you can't tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty.  To start, the cheese curds are required eating.  I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh.  Make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point.  

When you think bar food, you think burgers.  And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent.  Not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well.  At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful ""contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained"" feeling afterwards.  

A quick rundown on other items I've tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge.  Go to Gino's a mile away if you're craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.  The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  The pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut's deep dish.  The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.  The ""Philly"" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.

The best part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie.  But it will probably cost more than your entire meal here."
5,"Ahhhh! The best burger I think I've had! (the champion?) This place has redeemed my first impression of Phoenix! My beloved and I were just passing through. Phoenix was hot (really hot), congested, and filled with erratic drivers, leading to stress and grumpiness. The Welcome Cafe took us in with open arms. Awesome food, awesome drinks, awesome people. We laughed and joked with everyone at the bar like they were family. We'd be here at least once a week if we lived here. Well Done!!"
1,Two of the the soups look like they've been sitting there all day your server never even greets you or gets anything for you so why tip?
5,"We stopped here to eat before we went to the game. The food was EXCELLENT! The service was amazing as well. We had a mushroom burger, wings, sliders & fries. Everything was extremely tasty and the atmosphere was enjoyable and fun."
1,"If you're not Caucasian don't anticipate getting service, but do anticipate getting dirty looks by the employees, and other Caucasian shoppers.  Someone should tell the associates', and the overall company that people of color's money is just as good as Caucasian's. Perhaps this store would benefit from ""Sensitivity & Diversity"" traning.  It is so rude to not welcome EVERYONE to your store, and to not treat all those who enter your store with the same level of respect, and willingness to assist as the last regardless of their skin color. I'll spend my hard earned money else where thank you."
5,"Love love love this place - the only bad thing is they have 1 location -
I drive all the way from N Scottsdale to downtown Phoenix for their fresh deli sandwiches.  I always get the poor boy with everyhting...they always put the right amount of dressing and veggies and of course fresh meats - it's huge ! so come here with a big appetite - one of the truly REAL New York style subs...going to get one right now ;)"
1,"Been here before. Was good. During middle of day. Told my wyfe ""you gotta try this place"" its yummy. Took her for dinner. Her cheeseburger was over cooked and dry. My wings were charred and dry. Wait staff asked how it was and i told her ""overcooked"". She said sorry can i make u more? I said NO cant stomach anymore of their food. So what do i get in return? A FULL BILL!!! $30..... At least the wyfe learned a new drink. Wont be back here, which sucks cause they are stumbling distance from home"
5,"You can get anything you want, at Alice's restaurant....

Had out of town guests and we went there on a weekday. Arrived just as they opened at 11 and were immediately greeted by hostess and seated. Loved the ""decor"" and spent several minutes (well, actually quite a while) checking it out. Yeah, it's similar style to the Hard Rock Cafe, but that's to be expected. As for the food, well it was plentiful, delicious and fair priced. I had Cooper's Turkey Sliders and they were awesome. I really liked everything about the place and despite the 30 min drive will be back often (esp when we have visitors or go to the Sky Harbor). Location is perfect for before or after a Diamondback or Suns game. Awesome classic rock playing made it even better!

One suggestion: this place would be even more fun if the staff looked like they enjoyed their jobs. Not a lot of smiles or friendly small talk."
1,"The food is blah. I ate there for a long time just because it is the closest Asian restaurant, but really the food could be better.... OK, it could be a lot better. A long time ago, I used to love their frog legs, but now they are so bad I cant even tell you. The abundance of sauce ruined the crispiness of the frog legs. I was so disappointed!

They raised their prices by 50% or more on some dishes & sides. Some of the prices have almost doubled. For example, the small rice was $1. Now, it's $1.50 extra. The large was $2. Now, it's $3.50.  It is something stupid but still annoying.

Also, it is hard to order food from them over the phone... To tell you the truth I sometimes have trouble ordering food from them there because they dont seem to be able to communicate very well in English. And you always have to double check your order.

The food is inconsistent.  It's not great but it's food and still fairly inexpensive. I wont bother eating there again because their food keeps getting worse & worse. I have had 2 friends get sick from their food. Watch out for their chicken! My friend said he got undercooked chicken from this place.

Also, They wont give out copies of their to-go menu with the new prices on it. So you kinda just have to take their word for it on the new prices... It used to be a place we went often but it's getting to the point that I'm kinda just over this place.

Yah, the more I think about it, I'm way over this place."
5,"We just moved to Madison. A co-worker goes to David's all the time and won't stop talking about it. So I scooped up my wife and we drove the 20 mon to David's 

Wow that was good

My wife had the Jamaican National dish and I had the jerk pork. Both were out of this world as was the jerk sauce.  Perfect favors. (the beef patties were not spicy- kinda boring)

Would I go there again?  Of course. Will it be soon. Probably Monday (closed Sunday )

The nice woman who waited on us.... Very helpful when I said it was my first time there. God bless you. 

We are from Miami- where the Jamaican SUCKED. This was awesome"
1,"Was not a fan. The service was horrible, pork was chewy and they were out of mac n cheese. The only good thing was they had Big Red on the fountain. I will not return."
5,"BEWARE: SERVING SIZES ARE GINORMOUS!

We did not know this^^ and over-ordered!! Next time the BF and I are splitting a plate of pasta! 
Calamari appetizer was SO inexpensive and SO much food! In fact I think all their dishes are underpriced for the quantity that you get. This was the most delicious app I have had--so flavorful and so FRESH! 
On top of the calamari we also got the sausage pasta and the seafood pasta. Both had heaping amounts of food and delicious in their own sense. We were seafood-ed out after the appetizer so we were devouring the sausage pasta. The sauce for the sausage pasta was amazing--we took the noodles from the seafood dish and dunked it in the other plate's sauce to drink it all up :)"
1,"This place is a joke. The internet sucks. Lousy cell phone reception. A/C barely works. I lived there for almost a year, rent was late a couple times but barely, never had a single complaint and all the sudden had my lease terminated and was given a little more than a week to leave. Was told by the manager, when asked Why, ""I'm not gonna get into it with you"". A year almost of paying rent and being a good tenant and booted without reason. Even told that I'll receive good reference from them. Wired. Makes No sense. They are shade. I had No smoke detector for the first 9 months I was there which is illegal.. Also came home one day and a maintenance Man was inside my apartment without permission or reason, also illegal. Some units are updated...but most are dilapidated and inundated with mold. Many tenants are so disquisting that it smells incredibly bad just walking past their apartment. I had laundry stolen twice and even thigh they have security cameras they did No good at all. Surveillance cameras are only worth the surveillance they provide and apparently they did No good. I wouldn't rent here. It's cheap. But the property owner is a slumlord that bullies tenants. Don't waste your time"
5,"SO happy we stopped here. Wisconsin cheese, wine & beer...perfect for dinner!!! We tried about 10 cheeses and fudge. ..they were all so good.The dark chocolate caramel salted fudge was delicious. Glad we stopped here and so will you. :)"
5,"We love this HGI!  We are from the area, and through business acquaintances, have enjoyed many happy hours and dinners there.  They have, and will also put on the Holiday party for my spouse's firm and they do an excellent job.  We are looking forward to the December party!

Last weekend, we had our 31st anniversary and wanted to do something different, so we checked into a jacuzzi suite, had the lover's package and had a wonderful time.  Premiere shopping is right out there door. along with a variety of eateries and pubs.  The staff helped me to get things to the room early so it could be a true surprise--thank you!

In our opinion, the staff and the hotel are exceptional!  We look forward to many more casual visits and stays!  Thank you to Carl, Chris and Chris the Bar Manger for many great times--and the rest of the wonderful staff!

1,"some equipment just goes missing, too. my boyfriend says the scale in the mens locker room has been missing for 2 months, randomly. one day i noticed someone using the gym's jump ropes and decided the next day i would do that because it looked nice and intense. next day = all jump ropes gone! no reason... they never came back either so i just bought my own and bring it there. 

i asked the front desk about it, they said ""oh, we need a code to get in to the equipment rooms."" and i was like ""well, can you get it or ask someone to open it?"" and the response was ""well, i dont really know which trainers are here right now, so i dont know."" and i was like ""nevermind"" -- no point in pressuring an obviously unmotivated employee.

although the skinny hispanic guy that looks like he thinks hip hop is super cool thats there in pre-6am hours is fabulous. he remembers your name, inquires as to why you are late, asks why your workout was so short today if you leave too early, etc. great guy. he's young, i dont know his name, but someone should notice that he's a great employee. hes the type of person that, at first glance, you would think he would be an idiot or lazy - but definitely not."
5,i LOVE ryans pet supply! they always have smiles when they greet you and have unbeatable prices!
1,If you are young and hot Miguel will move you to the front of line maybe even skip you a few more times just because he doesn't like the way you look.  I ended my service after 12 years of being a loyal customer.   This was not the only reason!  Just where I finally realized Verizon really does not appreciate its customers.
1,"Food is ok but not such a good value for the price.  Drinks are expensive.  Service is awful.  Slow, got the orders mixed up, the bills were mixed up,  the server was unprofessional (rude, calling women ""darlin"" - how tacky).  Watch out when they add 18% service on a big party - on our bill it said 18% but the math came out to more like 30%.  The decor is just awful.  There are lots better places to eat."
5,Yet another neighborhood convenience store that does it right!  Sunshine Market is pretty darn cool.  The employees are really nice too and that is what makes these neighborhood markets so great!  SUPPORT THE LOCAL MARKETS!!
5,Went to the Ultimate Science Fair held by Yelp. It was awesome. Tons of great people...walked out super toasty and full from yummy foods! Thanks Yelp!
1,"Wow. Just, wow. As a former employee of this location, I'm sorely disappointed. I used to be a hostess here and always LOVED the food. So I figured I'd take my boyfriend to grab a nice breakfast. Boy was I wrong. I ordered the huevos rancheros with chorizo (always been my favorite) and ended up with eggs and bland potatoes, with chunky sour cream (ew) and a light sprinkling of chorizo. Um, what? I paid almost 30 bucks for this? The food was bland and not good at all. I couldn't even finish my meal it was that bad. I'll never go back. How disappointing. Maybe you should stop recruiting your employees/chefs from McDonalds. The good egg has really let itself go."
1,"So this is heartbreaking.  I've been going to Havana cafe for years and over looked a lot as far as decor and service, but once the food goes... So do I.  A friend who used to live here, who was visiting, suggested Havana cafe for dinner since it was always great.  Our food was not good.  It was ok at BEST and our service was lack luster- snotty really.  Then they cleared our plates before we were done and started to vacuum while we were still eating. If we were the only people keeping them there late, which it was NOT LATE AT ALL (and we weren't the only patrons there)  I could understand, but overall the service was poor right out the gate and our food wasn't great, So we will not be going back, which breaks my heart. Since I've had many good experiences in the past. I always knew I was paying more, but I figured it was worth it, but I don't think $400 for 5 people was worth that kind of poor service.  ESPECIALLY since SO many places are closing up these days."
5,"A fantastic art museum occupying a network of beautiful, Spanish-style buildings, the Heard Museum enjoys a wide selection of Native American art, both traditional and contemporary. They feature an extensive Pueblo pottery collection, some very beautiful Navajo rugs, and a vast collection of Hopi kachinas. One of the contemporary exhibits is a glass sculpture that is created to mimic a traditional Southwestern fence made of ocotillo branches. The museum grounds are beautiful and rather extensive. In the courtyard, you can enjoy an excellent lunch at the museum's cafe while listening to the soothing sounds of the museum's main water feature. I do think that the Native American crafts on sale in the gift shop are a little overpriced, as I have seen similar items of the same high quality sold elsewhere for less. However, I would have no problem making a worthwhile purchase here, seeing that it would go to support a truly excellent art museum. The Heard Museum is a must-see."
5,"I received a rave recommendation from a friend, so I scheduled an appointment.  I was very happy with it.  Dr. Mauresetter, Amy and Robyn were all very professional and personable.  They were much more thorough than my previous optometrist."
1,"35 minutes. That's how long my four-year-old son and I waited from the time we sat down until we received our lunch. Granted, my son is more patient than most children his age, but after about 20 minutes, he started to ask about where his food was. This occurred on Good Friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm.

I guess I should have been alerted to this situation from the moment I walked in. No one greeted us, and it took about three minutes before we were even acknowledged. We wanted to sit outside, but after 60 seconds of debating with a colleague, the gentleman told us there were no outside seats - although we clearly saw two empty tables. Then, the shirts on the employees said, ""Unique like a Brooklyn accent."" I really should question a company that doesn't use proper grammar. (It should read, ""Unique, like a Brooklyn accent."")

The person who seated us also took our order moments after we sat down. I asked for apple juice for my son and was told they were out, so we switched to iced tea for him and water with lemon for me. We shortly received our drinks - sans lemon. 

After we were there about 10 minutes, a large party of 10 was seated near us. Half were small children my son's age and they received lemons with their beverages, so my thought that the restaurant was perhaps out of those too was erased. Unfortunately, our waiter never checked on us, and I actually had to flag him down as my son was whining for food to get a water refill and ask - again - for a lemon. It was then that he told me he'd check on our food.

FINALLY, 35 minutes in, our food arrived. I think we were so hungry at that point that dirt would have sufficed. My son doesn't usually like mac and cheese that is penne with cheese sauce, but he ate nearly all of it. My eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best I've had. Neither of our items was baked, so I'm still not sure what the holdup was. And, by the way, the table of 10 received their food before we did and came and left in the hour we were there. While I'm complaining, my son's ice cream was so frozen I almost needed a knife to cut it for him.

I would like to say the poor service was because the restaurant was understaffed. Although the place was full, I counted seven employees, including a manager. Other tables were receiving much better service, so I'd have to say the problem was more with our server (who never shared his name). My son and I eat out about once a week, and I always leave 20% for a tip, but this time I left $1 on a $16 bill. At first, I felt badly about it, but then I remembered, ""Oh yeah, it's not like I'm ever coming back here.""

*** On 4/5/10, Alana, a representative from NYPD Pizza sent me an e-mail when she came across my review and offered her sincere apologies, a follow-up call from customer service, and a coupon for a free pizza / meal. I was very appreciative of the response, and as I told her, I've been to other NYPD Pizza locations with much better results; I think this episode was the result of a new or poorly trained server."
5,We love this place!  This restaurant has excellent food!  It has been family owned for years and that is what makes the difference.  Love being regulars here!  Friday night fish fries are always good.  Scallops are really worth trying.  Salads are always fresh.  Chili is very thick and meaty. This place and staff are always welcoming even when you arrive by boat!  Highly recommend it.  Be sure to  check out their specials on their awesome website!  http://www.thegreenlanternrestaurant.com.
1,"Saw Eric Clapton 03-15-13 and had a terrible time. The reason was the sound system. US Airways Center has the worst sound system I've ever heard for the money spent. no bass, mids way too boomy. I could hardly tell it was music let alone actually hear anything. The sound was so bad that I feel they ripped me off. Had a terrible time."
1,I also would not suggest renting from this company.  This is the worst experience in terms of maintenance in my life.  Why would you leave a unit empty for four months and NOT paint it or fix it up.  It's obvious the unit was not painted as there are stains on the ceiling.
5,"ok, so I've been back to this place oh 3 or 4 more times. I love this place! The food is excellent and you can tell by how busy they are that they are obviously doing something right.

I recommend the chicken nachos as an appaitizer. I don't know how they make their chicken so flavorful, but it's amazing. It's like charbroilled or grilled, so tasty. The nachos are basically 4 or 5 tostada's cut in half.  You get a layer of beans, topped with jalapeno's, cheese and chicken. A side of guacamole and sour cream come with this plate.

The chicken chimi enchilada style with the red sauce is beyond words. It's the same chicken used in the nachos. I basically lick the plate clean. 

I have also tried the shrimp enchiladas - too shrimp tasting for my taste, but my sister -in-law, who's big into seafood really enjoyed them. Comes with a lot of shrimp.

The carne asada tacos - were fantastic.

If you want really well done Mexican food don't waste your money anywhere else. Just come here. The wait staff is excellent and attentive."
1,Rude customer service on the phone-like you are doing me a favor even answering my questions regarding bringing my vacuum in for repair=I am going somewhere else.
1,"Dry.  Bland.  Gristly.  Bad cuts of meat in sickly sweet sauce.  This place only makes me love my favorite BBQ places more (oh Fat Matt's Rib Shack, why do you have to be all the way in Atlanta??)

...and no greens on the menu?  For shame!"
1,"I'm only giving one star because I have too. I have been coming to this car wash for years and I've always thought highly of this place and the owner. I referred my good friend to this place for a mini detail, and payed for it myself to show him how good this place is. When he picked up his car they jammed his key in the ignition and could not get it out. They took no responsibility for it and the owner told us it's not her problem. Then when we took it to honda to get fixed, they informed us they got a sensor wet underneath the shifting council and now that needs to be replaced as well. I am definitely taking them to court."
5,"Excellent local sandwich shop, I've been going here for several years and the sandwiches are always good. Great prices an always fresh. Support your local business."
1,"My wife and I used to love Arriba's, til recently when we joined some friends at the end of their table for dinner. We arrived about an hour after they did, and they were finished when we got there.
 I ordered a stuffed poblano chili dish and it really was not good at all. Bad enough that the food was bad, but when we were ready to leave, we asked the waitress for our check, so she gives us a check for the whole table.
 My wife said, ""No-we want our check only"" and the waitress said that they do not do seperate checks, which is B.S. because we always have gotten seperate checks at the Arriba's in Arrowhead. This created a big hassle for us because we never carry cash, so my wife had to pay back one of her friends for our share of the bill the following week.
 This is no way to conduct a business, and I also sent the main office an email telling them about what had happened, but they never answered the email. I guess customer satisfaction means nothing to them, so we will NEVER go back! 

 Anyplace can roast chilis, so thats nothing special for Arriba's.

 Macayos is the place from now on, and the food there is superior to Arriba's."
1,My family of 5 went for dinner on a Saturday night. We had a reservation for 6:30 granted we went early to see if we could be seated earlier but no luck needless to say we did not get seated till almost 7. The hostess staff was rude and had to get the manager involved. My kids did not like to food at all and they love spaghetti and meatballs. Food did not come out hot at all. The food was also average nothing special about it. I would not recommend this place and will not be coming back.
5,"The BFD isn't Payton Curry. its not the food, either, its the floorshow. Payton and his wife manage to make this tiny space feel cavernous and fabulous. Their banter is hysterical, and Payton somehow manages to hear everything said on the floor from his outpost cooking. The words fly fast, but you'll laugh hysterically. 


And the food? Inventive, fresh, reasonable and fast."
1,"Against my better judgment, I went to Pat Murphy's again. I mean, it's right around the corner from my house and they have Smithwicks on tap. Plus, my friends were going for karaoke and I hadn't seen them in awhile.

Still a dump. Still lame. Still hate it."
1,"You might want to reconsider ordering the PHO.  Completely flavorless.  My guess would be the broth is made from a powered mix.  Add the fact that they charge $10 makes it even worse.  Meatballs were rubbery, sliced beef dry and chewy.  
Owners need to consider taking this off the menu.  Would have sent it back but a co-worker went on a lunch run and picked this up for me to go.  Gross, Gross Gross...."
1,"I should have went to the Safeway next door for sushi.

This was the first time I went to sushi joint, looked at the menu and decided that the best sounding thing was the steak. I opted for the grilled salmon and wasabi mash. While I am a huge sushi fan, the price of the rolls were a wee bit more expensive than some GOOD sushi places I went to. My friend opted for a bento box that had a crab nigiri (which was simply a half a stick of imitation Krab on top of rice). So sad. 

My plate arrived and looked like a garden threw up on my plate. The steamed veggies were scattered around my plate like the salad shooter malfunctioned. The grilled salmon was just okay, served on top of wasabi mash that was also just okay. 

The server was also very clueless. She brought over a bowl of miso soup and sat the soup between my friend and I. I wasn't sure who it belonged to so I asked for straws so we could share. =) She didn't think it was too funny. She said she wasn't sure whose meal it came with so she just left in the middle so we can figure it out. (THANKS!)

By the way, the waitresses were wearing traditional Chinese dresses. Shouldn't they be in a kimono or something? Who is the smart white guy that owns this place?!

I walked away from Zen 32 and I won't be back."
1,"Coffee is fine, foo foo coffees are fine, pastries are fine, teas are fine, ambiance is pretty good with wireless and a nice selection of books to choose from, even location is pretty good. The problem, and it is a persistent problem with these people, is the service is terrible. Indifferent counter help on their best days, downright surly on their bad days. It's to the point where we won't even go in there anymore. Such potential...... lost to a crabby attitude towards the customers. If you want to own or work in a coffee shop then be ready to screw a smile on your face and show some positive energy."
1,"Worst diner ever! The food is subpar, my wife got a blt and the lettuce was literally rotten, not a little discolored but ROTTEN! I ordered coffee and I dunno I expect my coffee at the beginning of the meal, the waitress didn't bother to bring it until she brought the food. Tried to her flag down for a refill I must have been invisible because she was ignoring us like a french waiter. So I had to go inside and get my own coffee. Dont waste your time at this shithole, they stay open on name recognition alone. I know many people will say best malts ever, good food but I will venture to say they are wrapped up in the nostalgia. Waste of money, waste of time, waste of space. Burn it down and build a parking lot, or a dennys at least I could get a cup of coffee. I will not go back, ever."
5,"Always a positive experience! My husband and I went to see the Fox on the Stairway a couple of weeks ago and thought it was great. It was funny, engaging and overall a great play. The acting was very good, wonderful character portrayal. Looking forward to seeing more plays from them soon! 

PS: This particular play is not suitable for kids."
1,"Run by college students for college students. Which is good if you are a UW student, bad for everyone else. I have seen fellow students get fat sandwiches and extras for no extra cost. While the rest of the world gets a skinny sandwich and crap service.
I only go here if I have no other choice. I suggest going down the road to University Station and hit the Subway there. Better service and sandwiches."
5,Thumbs up to an 8.95 sandwich platter that includes two sides and fills me up like no other. Seriously. The amount of food. The quality. That sauce! Go grab yourself a brisket sammie with corn and fries. You'll thank me tomorrow.
1,"Was craving sushi and decided to give this place a try. I was really reluctant since this restaurant serves Italian , Korean and Japanese. 

It took forever for the server to show up after we were seated, so an automatic minus one star for that. 

And then when the waiter decided to come by , he was in an extreme hurry. 

Ordered the sushi combo, added a miso soup and bowl of steamed rice. Also ordered the philly roll. 

Waited forever to get a refill for my drink forever. The only thing that they were fast at was giving us the bill, before we even finished eating!!!

The quality of the sushi was really bad, rice portion was lacking, the rolls were falling off and overstuffed with bland an unfresh generic seafood.

They forgot to get me my bowl of rice, this place is the worst sushi place ever. We also noticed that the people preparing the sushi were of Hispanic origin. That explains the sushi quality but it doesn't explain the jack of customer service."
1,"Totally boring, I am glad my trip there was free."
1,"It was time for me to update my business wardrobe.
When it's that time,there are 3 Houses I look to.
Hugo Boss
St.John
Ralph Lauren
Had never been in the Lauren store at Biltmore and decided to give it a whirl.
It was Sunday afternoon last week and it wasn't busy.Wasn't empty either,but not only was I not greeted by the 2 sales women at the front of the shop,in fact they both turned away from me!
As I meandered, I did see a skirt on a manniquen that I liked and wanted to try with a summer white crisp jacket also displayed on a different manniquen.
I passed by a few more salespeople who when I got near,managed to turn their backs to me or to quickly engage someone else in conversation.
Hell,I would have been happy if a security guard started paying attention to me..
I couldn't find the skirt or jacket anywhere on the racks,and went to seek out the help of the sales staff.
I walked back up to the front of the shop where the skirt was on the manniquen,in the hopes of purchasing it.You would think at this point someone would ask if they could help me.I was obviously looking for something and someone who could assist.
One of the women who turned her back to me when I walked in,saw me,I smiled,made eye contact and a bee line to her.
I started to say ""Hello"" and she again turned her back and simply walked to the back of the store!
I was a bit stunned.At first I figured I'd follow behind asking if she could help me forcing her to just deal,but I decided to not further embarrass myself.
Kind of a shame as I did want the jacket and skirt,the paring being around 700.00...
I walked over to Macy's,where they did try to assist,but only carry the casual sportswear line of Lauren,and informed me that what I was looking at could only be bought from a Lauren store.
I guess I saved some money that day,but still,it was a pretty shitty way to outright profile what you think can't afford to shop in your store...."
5,"five stars is simply not enough.

i was always scared to try this place. i don't even think i knew it was still a functioning restaurant. 

i'm glad i was wrong."
5,"This place is awesome! The food is amazing to say the least. The only time I have been disappointed is when I showed up on a Monday and found out they were closed. Best place for Italian in the area. Thumbs up to the owner and staff, keep it up!"
1,"Honey Bears is a place I'd heard fantastic things about for quite some time and so when I finally made it over there one weeknight with some friends and office-mates, I was surprised to find it so incredibly lackluster. 

More than that, it was simply not good. I'm not sure if the food was just old and done for the day, as we were there about an hour before closing time, or what, but the meat was basically sprayed with some sauce and they called it a day. The meat was devoid of flavor and overcooked. I had chicken but the ribs were absolutely nothing to sneeze at either. The corn on the cob was simply some frozen piece nuked up or boiled or what-have-you, with some chips thrown in for good measure and that was about it.

The insides aren't impressive in the slightest, either. I've been to plenty of dive places and had a great dining experience and considered it more the fun for it (Lolo's original location in Phoenix comes to mind, as it has a certain fun and well-managed charm inside) but this was dark, dingy, and unpleasant.

The sauce was perhaps a saving grace if the food wasn't served nearly lukewarm and was able to bring something to the table on its own. Sadly, no amount of sauce-drowning could save my meal. I left unhappy and unfulfilled. I've heard so many great things from people I trust, so I may have to try it once more, during the day, but for now, the one star stands, as there was simply nothing even a little redeeming about this food."
5,Good parking for a downtown venue. I love walking in the sculpture garden of the art museum during intermission. They always put on very professional productions.
1,"The McManager sucks.  (he wouldn't run his store Safeway card for me!)

The debit/credit card swipers suck! (they don't fit in their holders and they must use a freakin' dialup modem they are so God Damn slow)

They once completely ran out of MILK!

Their change machine was down for well over a week!

I swear to God, if  there were any alternative in the vicinity I'd GLADLY pay twice the price to shop there! 

Revamped store is nice to look at, shitty to shop at!  

Now with free Wi-Fi! 

EAT ME!"
1,"I would NOT reccomend taking your computer to Data Doctors! I hear there is a small privately owned computer shop on 24th St and indian School that gets great reviews. Data Doctors looked over my laptop for 20-30 mins in the store (20th/Camelback) and then the tech told me he would have to send it to the Tempe main lab for full assessment. $100 to take it in and figure out what the problem is. I got a call 3 days later from someone else stating they just recieved my laptop and were going to look at it the next morning, so apparently it takes them 3 days to send my laptop from downtown Phx to downtown Tempe. The next day I got a call saying they basically have no clue what the issue is but that they are going to reinstall windows and see if that takes care of the problem. That will cost me an additional $200 to reinstall windows!! At this point I feel like I am trapped because I have already spent $100 bucks and they have the computer. I reluctantly agree to basically pay $300 to have windows reinstalled in my 2 year old laptop. When will I get it back? How long could that possibly take, right? Well, 3-5 days he says. it will take 3-5 days to reinstall windows into my laptop and that is ""putting it ahead of 30 other computers for me."" The guy is now acting like I should feel lucky that he is putting mine ahead of others because otherwise it could take 2 WEEKS?! 2 days later I get a call that it is done and seems to be working just fine. It will be back in the Phoenix store for me to pick up 2 1/2 days later...
Finally, I get my computer back after 2 weeks and $300. Oh well, at least it is all fixed now, right? WRONG. Now my computer will not connect to my wireless network at home. So I call and talk to my wireless provider for 35 minutes trying this and that and she determines it is my computer that has a problem, not the service. I knew that because the other 4 laptops in the house work fine but I figured maybe it just needed to be reset-up or something. 
I called the Data Doctors store to ask them to help me over the phone with maybe a setting or two. The location I dropped it off at originally has NO RECORD of my laptop ever even coming thru that store and they refer me to call the Tempe lab. I call the Tempe lab and tell two different people my issue before someone decides to help me. They tap into my computer from the lab and look at a few things for 10 minutes and then tell me he thinks it is my wireless connection!! I explain that I have several other computers in the house and that I never had an issue with the wireless component until I got it back from them. He says he does not think it is the computer but I have to take it back to the store to have them try to connect it to their wireless network and go from there...but he does not think it is the computer itself. I have a brand new modem and router.
What a bad experience that still is not over. 
I will never take my computers in to data doctors in the future and I would certainly not reccomend them to anyone else."
5,"First time here, and I devoured the teriyaki chicken plate w/spring rolls! SO MUCH FOOD -- and I only ordered the lunch special! It could have easily fed two people, but if it is that good, why share? I love places like this. Simple restaurant specializing in something they do best, and this is the place to come for teriyaki. My food arrived at my patio table in less than 10 minutes. The salad had a delicious citrusy/sesame tasting dressing that mixed well with the rice and chicken. Chicken was so tender, and the teriyaki was neither too sweet or salty! Perfect taste. Since I like super spicy food, my only regret was not squirting Sriracha sauce all over it. However, I didn't realize that until AFTER I was half way done with my meal. It was so flavorful my spicy craving didn't even kick in I was way too full to continue on. 

Good for lunch or early dinner since this place closes early. Drive-up window if you are in a rush!"
1,"Was next door waiting for my girlfriends doctor appointment when I got hungry so I walked over to this place. Says doors open at 10:30 so I checked my phone and surprisingly it was exactly 10:30, so I reached for the door and it was locked. I decided to wait 5 minutes in the chair outside and watched an employee walk in and lock the door behind him so I left. Needless to say if your establishment opens at 10:30 then be prepared to open at 10:30. They lost my lunch business for today."
5,"I have been craving Wild Thaiger for a year now (last time I was in town they were closed). The flavors are perfectly blended, the food is artistic, and the food choices are unlike that I've seen at two other Thai restaurants I've eaten at recently. Their Thai Iced Tea has to be some of the best I've tasted thus far. Its typically quiet which was perfect for girl's day out and chatting."
5,"My 13 mo. old had to have surgery. Dr. Gleason was his surgeon, Mary was his nurse and a hand full of other smiling faces help us on our big day. They took such great care of my baby, gave him wagon rides, toys, bubble and hugs and tickles. Not a single complaint.  I hope I never have to go there again,  but I'll be glad if I do."
1,"This place sucks. The wait staff  took a long time to get to my table, which was weird as it was not particularly packed that day. Overall, I had to wait nearly an hour between time of order to time of serving. Don't go there unless you are very patient."
1,"Talk about weak sauce. This place has dry. Dri. Drei. Dryyyyyy Pulled pork!  And drowning it in their boring sauce does not help things. In fact, given that they use seemingly store bought hamburger buns, drowning it in sauce makes it nearly impossible to eat.  Very sad pulled pork sandwich."
1,"I went here on a Sunday afternoon at 1 PM to get a mani pedi before a trip.  I was promptly seated in a chair and then forgotten about for 30 minutes.  I am all about letting my feet soak but 30 minutes?  I was a prune by the time my nail tech got to me.  There were around 8 nail techs in the salon but they were all focused on 2 ladies and their 6 kids to wait on anyone else.  When my tech finally got to me, my pedicure lasted 15 minutes from start to final polish.  My tech didn't realize I wanted a manicure as well and took off to the next client.  I had to flag him back down and got a 5 min manicure.  He did do a great job on my buff but my cuticles were ragged and it was very haphazard.  They also only accept cash but have an ATM in the store incase all you have is a debit card.

The place was clean and had a lot of polish choices but definitely lacked on customer service.  If you are busy, take down my name and I will happily come back in an hour when you aren't as busy, don't let me sit with my feet in a bath for a half hour while you do polish changes on 5 yr olds."
5,"I am sure someday I will have a bad experience at this legendary Sports Bar, but not tonight.  I have made it a habit to come to Cooperstown prior to ball games and concerts for over 15 years. I anticipate keeping that tradition for years to come.

So many of the sports themed bars and restaurants in this area are lost to the culinary Sonoran graveyard.  Alice Cooperstown still stands for a reason.  The staff is friendly and fun loving, the menu diverse and in unison with the rocking roll and sports themed decor. 

I usually get the BBQ sampler or the incredibly stacked nachos, but tonight I went for the simplicity of the Tom Brady Burger.  It was ""Spot On."" 

The bacon was crisp and plentiful and the burger itself was perfectly cooked with a smoky charbroiled taste.  The fries were fresh, crisp and spiced perfectly. 

I opted for two Kiltlifter beers, from local microbrew Four Peaks Brewery.
The beer was available on draft served in nicely chilled her glass. 

Giant screen television monitors are strategically placed throughout the cavernous restaurant so every seat can view the game or games. 

The only negative remark actually is as a result of their popularity:  You may have to wait a while on big game or concert nights, plan for that contingency arrive early and enjoy the fun. 

""UNIT!"""
5,"This place is fantastic and cheap compared to big box stores.  Careful, though, of the Coscto effect: you walk in there with intention to buy one thing but end up with a whole cart of stuff for your pets. :) Very friendly staff.  We will be back for all of our needs.  Just went today to buy puppy post-surgery no chew collar.  They had a wide selection at greatly reduced prices."
5,"This restaurant was forced to close due to a greedy landlord that suddenly doubled their rent, probably because of the upgrades done with the new Walmart.  Does anyone know where this family went or if they opened in another location?  I would gladly go to the the one.  I haven't found any Chinese food as good."
1,"This place is a huge dissapoinment. You look at the menu and you get excited thinking. Oh this is going to be good!!!  Then the food comes and is wrong. Very wrong. 

The rice is wet and salty. Too much cilantro all over the place. This is not Mexican is Cuban. Yes we use cilantro on our food but not to that level. 

Rice should not be soup.  Bad cooking period."
5,"Easily one of my favorite local hangouts, Dexter's is a ""dive"" bar without the ""dive."" The beer selection is wonderful, bartenders and staff are knowledgeable and attentive, and the food is well above typical bar food standards. There are tables for dining, a long bar for sitting and watching the game, and volleyball courts out back for summer fun. If you're going for the food, I have to recommend the fish fry and/or nacho platter. If you're going for the beer, you won't be disappointed. And if you're looking for a fun place to watch a Badger victory with friends, you've got the right bar."
1,"The food was great and the waiter Patrick was very attentive. We were the last ones to leave on a Saturday night. My cell phone was left on the seat. After realizing while still in the car I called and there was no answer. The next day no one could find it. I strongly recommend not to bring anything of value to this restaurant, cause the employees will not turn it in to lost and found"
1,"My problem with Coup Des Tartes really is that the food is horribly overpriced...not moderately overpriced makes you feel like you're eating at a fancy place, but outrageously overpriced for the quality of the food. For their price points, the food should be a lot better and the tables shouldn't be so close to each other. Their food reminded me of the kind of food I can get from the Whole Foods deli. After Valentine's Day here, I felt taken advantage of by the restaurant. $100 PER PERSON for a measly set of 4 courses with the awful offering of cliched mushroom risotto as the sole vegetarian option, with no choice of anything else. Had the menu been priced at around $40 a person, I still think this place would still only be a 3 star quality but at least reasonably priced. 

- Brie Brulee: A name far more interesting than the dish itself. It's a warm slice of brie served with stale/boring crusty bread and fruit. There was the tiniest bit of fruit compote served with it, so at least someone in the kitchen did something that required effort with this otherwise simple dish. 
- Onion Tarte: Probably the tastiest thing all night, but again, not worth the money. It has a very strong caramelized onion taste with a nice flaky crust.
- Salad: Greens, fruit, nuts, and too much dressing. It was fine but not worth $25.
- Chestnut Soup: Didn't taste a thing like chestnuts. The taste is actually like an Indian lentil soup called Sambar. 
- Filet Mignon: My boyfriend seemed to like it. The mashed potatoes it was served with were very good. The other accompaniment were sugar snap peas drowning in butter/oil.
- Lamb Shank: The couscous & veggies served with the lamb were very boring tasting, like no one even took the time to season them.
- Cherry Tart: This was yummy, and fortunately didn't taste much like cherry. The shortbread crust was good and the combination of warm pie with cold ice cream is classic.
- Chocolate Ganache Tart: Pretty good. It, of course, tasted like chocolate. Nothing really remarkable.

I'm confused why everyone calls this place charming. It is not charming to be a foot away from the tables next to you. It is not charming to hear their conversation like you're having it with them, struggle to push out your chair to get up because there is another chair right behind you, and struggle to squeeze yourself between tables to leave. I cannot recommend Coup Des Tartes to anyone. The restaurant left a very bad taste in my mouth, figuratively. With so many other nice, moderately overpriced restaurants with much better food, I don't know why anyone would come here."
1,"First let me say i love Embassy Suites and hilton Hotels but my gripe is about the Hilton Honors Program. I booked several stays through Orbitz so i can book my flight and Hotel together and on those stays Hilton accpets my Honors number but when i review my account to see how many points i had i noticed on those 2 stays there were ZERO points. Come to find out that booking through another site Hilton won't honor those stays. This is crazy as most people don't ever reall book direct to a hotel when traveling on buisness. I had been a Marriott Rewards member for over 10 years and will be switching back because of this, Embassy Suites are nice and cost much more and for me to not get the points is a deal breaker for my dollars. Wish this policy would change and when i called she simply said sorry company policy and if you want the points you have to book seperately. Extremely dissappointed i must say!"
5,"Great sandwiches (that's all I've tried) - especially their honey-mustard and brie combinations (with Turkey, Ham, or Roast Beef). Yum. I also appreciate their convenient variety of snacks and candy, even Tylenol if you need it. They serve coffee too, although I haven't tried it yet.

Its a pretty basic sandwich shop, that caters to students and employees at ASU's Mercado buildings on Van Buren, and to a lesser extent the UA College of Medicine across the street, and Heritage Square. Its too bad the storefront is so hidden - you have to know exactly where you're walking or you'll miss it, and its not at all visible from the street.

I'm not sure what upsets everyone so much about the prices - this isn't Subway, their sandwiches are much more substantial, and you get chips (plain Lays potato chips) in the bag with your sandwich. Most of the sandwiches are between $6 - $7, but that's what you'd pay at Corner Bakery or really any non fast-food-chain or sandwich shop these days. Also, it's a local business for goodness sake, in downtown Phoenix no less, so consider the fact that they represent exactly the kind of economic activity this part of the city needs. There's some cheaper pre-made sandwiches and snacks for sale if you're really so concerned.

Despite having just compared it to generic fast food, the service really is quite fast. Unfortunately, there isn't room in the tiny shop for any tables, but you can order a sandwich and they'll have made it in 2-5 minutes while you wait.

The owner, Tom, is there almost every day, and most of the employees are very nice and will remember your order if you go there frequently.

Also, they just replaced their cash register with an iPad and use Square, so they will swipe your card on the iPad and sign with your fingertip, OR (even cooler) you can use the Pay with Square app and never have to take out your wallet at all."
5,"YOU.MUST.EAT.HERE! 
Everything is to delish but the burgers are to die for.
The blue cheese burger is by far my fave but on our last visit we found it had been removed from the menu because they rotate the burgers out. Hesitantly, I tried the peanut butter burger....and oh.my.god! The oddest concoction, but delicious! 

Ps....please bring back ol' blue!!"
1,"The owner commented, and is still rude and lying in her comments.  She invited me in her comment to try another salon.  Wow.  thank you.  I did.  And I LOVED it.  And they let me try the Invati products and helped me with all of that for FREE.  that's right.  What you actually did say is that for more money you will let me try the Invati.  No thanks."
1,Weak food for yuppies. Overpriced. Underwhelming.  And you're surrounded by West Siders who should really know better... but of course don't.
1,"If you want ""Italian food"" that has the look and feel of a Stouffer's t.v. dinner, Fazoli's gets it right.

Actually, I take that back.  If you are heating up a t.v. dinner, at least you are guaranteed it will be warm."
1,"Okay beside the fact that this is not real mexican food it was just sad to even call it food, on my first visit i made it my last the food is disgusting but i managed to eat something. . Then on my way out was the worst part i went to wash my hands and the bathroom was the worst thig i had ever seen there was vomit and shit everywhere seriously a health and safty violation please don't bother bringing ur family or friends here unless u want diarrhea!"
1,"I emailed this letter to the store;

Hello:

Yesterday afternoon I found myself in the unfortunate position of being 350 miles from my studio without a piece of equipment.  While I was driving into Phoenix from Los Angeles,I realized we had left a posing stool. We called ahead to your store and inquired if you had one. We were told yes. We then set a course to come to your store immediately.  Unfortunately, coming from CA we didn't realize you we're 1 hour aead of us.  We called once the realization hit. We had 75 minutes to travel 60 miles.  We made every effort to arrive by 6:00, as we were told rather rudely, that the store was closing at 6 sharp.  At 5:55, from about 4 blocks away, we called again and asked if they could ready our purchase, that we would run in and buy. We were told NO, that we better arrive before 6, that ""You have 4 minutes"".  I cannot begin to express the frustration and anger that your store couldn't accommodate a simple request, and was completely unsympathetic to the fact that we were driving straight from LA to you.  In fact, I arrived at 6:00 on the dot, as Randy I believe was locking the door.  He could have cared less. While part of me says, ""the people who run this store don't care about anything, why write this email"", as a business owner and potential customer, you deserve to know why I will make it my personal mission on every review site, website etc to let other potential customers know, just how much you value our business.

I have never been treated like that by any company or vendor, and as a fellow business owner, I'm appalled by the blatant attitude and disrespect. I don't know any other company who wouldn't have gladly tried to help us or offered a solution acceptable to both.

I wish your business luck for the future. If you continue to treat customers like you did me, you won't have much of a business left.

Respectfully!"
1,"This review is exclusively for the T Cook's (if it is part of T Cook's) lounge area only as we did not stay in the hotel. I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, however, we feel that people need to hear about the experience we had here. In summary, we would not return due to their poor customer service and have shared the following experience w/ our friends and family.  My husband thought it would be nice for us to go out and do something special before NYE to help us decide if we should spend NYE there. He did a whole lot of internet research and found that according to the website, the Lounge area of this hotel had flamenco entertainment once a month.  He called to verify and to see if we needed reservations, the woman who answered was quite nice, he said, and confirmed the start time of the entertainment. How fun, we thought! We dressed for the occasion and were very excited to go to this Lounge; we went wednesday december 28, 2011 and arrived at 6pm. The grounds are absolutely beautiful-we were even more excited as we were pointed towards the back area to The Lounge.  First off, we walked in, there was no hostess/host, no one to greet us- not knowing if we were in the right place, we looked around and at that time a waitress (or maybe the bus girl?) practically ran past us, clearly not wanting to be side tracked.  My husband asked her if this was the place where they had the flamenco entertainment and as she was walking away/running away, she said that there wasn't any flamenco there and pointed to the bar and told us to ask the ""bar supervisor"". My husband and I looked at each other wondering, huh? So we both walked over to the bar where there was a bartender and one of the waitresses, Kathryn and i think another bar person. We stood there waiting for them to agknowledge us, which they didn't, so after a few awkward seconds my  husband  asked them if this was the place, etc...Truly we felt like we were interrupting their conversation; we felt, at this point, very unwelcome and it hadn't even been 5 minutes since we arrived. We were pretty sure that we were in the wrong place and there's no flamenco entertainment here.  They all looked at each other to ask themselves, is there flamenco entertainment here? One said no, the other one had no idea and Kathryn the waitress said that they did but that it would be outside. All this while, no one was speaking to us, there were speaking amongst themselves. We found this to be extremely rude, impolite and uninviting. I think my husband asked if food was served there, Kathryn at this point said yes and informed us that there was also a restaurant down the hall (TCooks) that served food.  We felt pretty uninvited there, like she was shooing us away, actually now that i think about it, so we walked to TCooks and realized that we weren't in the mood for formal dining and returned grudgingly to The Lounge. We didn't get a 'welcome back' or any greeting that could turn the previous experience around but yet we decided to sit. The waitress Kathryn was dutifully pleasant while taking our order. The hors d'hoerves were good, but I have to mention this: when the ""bus girl'? I didn't get her name served us the food, not a word from her. My husband politely said, ""Thank you"" as she served us the food and still not a word back from her. She's the one that nearly ran us over -i noted her above. All in all,  I'm not sure what was going on w/ their service staff,  I really feel they just didn't want to be there and secondly,  they have been inadequately trained in providing excellent customer service.
Rude, impolite, unwelcoming and not knowledgeable about entertainment provided there. Definately not a place we will return to-that includes the resort.   We did not stay for the originally much anticipated flamenco entertainment which ended up being inside and not outside like were told-we felt too unwelcomed."
5,"If you are looking for a classic Catholic church in Phoenix, this is it. St. Mary's Basilica has a beautiful sounding choir, wonderful priests and a historically Catholic feel with architecture and structure. I think it has something to do with the fact that Pope John Paul II visited this basilica years ago for World Youth Day. 

I've been going to St. Mary's Basilica for years. Ironically enough, Father Vince, who is a priest at St. Mary's Basilica, used to be the priest at St Isidore's in Danville, California which was the church I went to when I was growing up. 

During the holidays, I make sure I attend mass at St. Mary's Basilica. There's something about the architecture, music, and Mass that makes this a perfect church for those times. However, it's also a great church for Sunday mass. 

Around 7 years ago, my sister married her husband at St Mary's Basilica  and I was lucky enough to be the Maid of Honor. The wedding was a full Mass and made it such a special day for my sister, her husband, myself and everyone who witnessed the ceremony. 

There isn't much more I can say about St. Mary's Basilica in this review, but I will end this by saying that each Mass is a different experience and it's based on the person attending, but be sure to visit this church and attend a Mass so see if it's right for you."
5,"This is the first review I am writing for Yelp and I am inspired to do so because of my great experience at Virginia Auto Service. 
(Although I didn't know it) My engine belt broke on my way to work while driving on the highway. I managed to get safely to work and I ended up calling Virginia Auto Service upon the recommendation of a friend. Within minutes of talking to Matt he had provided an initial assessment (which turned out to be correct) and advised me how to proceed. He encouraged me to get the car towed and was VERY clear that he would rather I bring my car to another shop if it was less expensive for me and/or safer. How refreshing! He also took the time to look at a similar car in his lot so as to better inform me of possible scenarios.... all before I had committed to utilizing his services. 
I towed it to Virginia Auto Service (thanks for instructing me to contact my insurance company- towing was free) where it was assessed, fixed, cleaned and ready in hours. 
I really really felt like Matt wanted to educate me about my car and ensure my safety before getting my business. 
I cannot compare their prices to another shop's but I would rather have caring, honest and thorough mechanics than a cheap bill. 
I fully recommend"
5,Fantastic pie! And food. And the servers were awesome. Now there's needs to be one in Indiana. And Ohio. In general they should just be everywhere.
1,"I went to Hard Rock Cafe for the first time with a coupon for a $4 meal. (Legenary burger, fries, and soft drink) The only positive is that the food was alright. It was good for the $4 I paid, but not the $15+tax and tip it was normally.

The cons:
- The customer service was laughable. Our waiter come up to my guest and I, who both had empty drinks at the time, and said ""Good? Good?"" with thumbs up. My guest asked for a refill and specified that I needed one, too. Later in the meal when both of our drinks were totally empty again, I asked for a refill. He only brought one for me, so my guest and I shared my drink. He clearly couldn't care less. 
- The burger was dry, like it was previously frozen. It definitely didn't taste fresh.
- The veggies on the side to put on the burger weren't crisp. I usually like lettuce on my burger, but not their wilted lettuce.
- The fries weren't seasoned and they weren't anything special. I'd compare them to Wendy's fries. 
- The music videos they play are awful. For being the Hard Rock Cafe you'd think that they'd play some well known rock stuff. ...nope... my guest and I were there for almost two hours and there was only one song we recognized. While I'm not a music expert, my guest is. To top it off, their bad music is so loud that you have to yell to talk to someone across the table. I expected loud music at the Hard Rock Cafe, but not bad loud music."
5,"The 5-star reviews are true!

I took my car in to have my passenger side door panel repaired. I swiped a concrete column and made a huge dent on the side. New skin and new paint was needed. The owner, Steve, showed me the new door skin the day I dropped it off to assure the correct one was going to be installed. It took three full business days to repair, just as promised. When the work was complete, I looked at the car from every conceivable angle and found ZERO imperfections! 

Choose Ultra Collision. Fair price for perfect work. Ask for Steve. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,"What a nice little place for lunch.  20 years ago my daughter used to eat lunch here when she was in high school and she loved it.  I took a business associate in the other day and it was exactly the same as we left it - a lunch cafe offering some very fresh, very tasty asian-american fare.  Nothing fancy, just good food served with a big fat smile.  And served fast!  Everything here is made from scratch from the finest meats and veggies.  The only thing I don't like are the cheap paper plates and utensils, but at these prices, no wonder!"
1,Ordered a specialty roll that was $14 dollars called the mayflower and it didn't live up to my expectations. It had more cucumber then tuna and forgot the cream cheese and avocado. It should have been called the cucumber roll with a slab of tuna on top. The following day my friend and I became violently ill with food poisoning!  I will never go anywhere near MOTO again after this experience.
5,"The Lantern doesn't profess to be anything more than it is. Good American, wisco supper club fare. Prices are very good, and they know how to cook a steak to temperature. Bloody Mary's are great as they allow you to add your own seasonings to taste.  Decent wine selection by the glass.  They even have sambuca. 
Try the surf n turf. Very good at a great price. 
Also fried chicken. 
Solid choice, and nicest place on lake waubesa."
5,"It's been over a month & I can not remember the servers name unfortunately. We arrived late on a Sunday evening on our way home from Minneapolis.  After checking into our hotel we were pleasantly surprised the restaurant was still seating.

We walked in and while there was no hostess a really great brunette server welcomed us and sat us in her section that was immediately left of the bar area & first booth on the left. 

We ordered the salad which is pretty much a given drenched with dressing.  We asked if we could just get a piece of grilled chicken and al dente veggies our waitress said she would check. We never ask for special orders unless its clear that similar options are on the menu. She brought out a chef to hear what we wanted. We were blown away. She cared so much about getting the order right she got a chef out there. To his credit he rocked it. YUM! Grilled chicken & lightly cooked veggies were perfect. We asked our waitress to please let him know how much we appreciated his efforts & how good they were."
1,"My first review of China Chili was 4 stars. After today's experience I am down to 1 star. I had Kung Pao Chicken and my wife had Lemon Chicken. I like it spicey but this was just sour. I had to leave it. My wife enjoyed her Lemon Chicken but 1 1/2 hours later became sick to her stomach. I wonder if anyone else had a similar experience there today. We have been there several times and were always pleased with everything. This was the first time we had this type of experience. Service was good, food was not."
5,The crew at this store couldn't be more friendly and helpful.  They were very honest and straight forward with what needed to be done with my car and what really was optional.  The pricing was fair and they explained all charges before doing the work.
5,"Mouthwatering food.

I have been here a few times, as it is walking distance from my office. 

The first time I ordered the vegetarian panang curry. Delicious and spicy. My only issue is I was sweating profusely on the walk back to the office. 

The last couple times I ordered the veggie pad thai. So scrumptious! They plate it beautifully. They use a good variety of fresh veggies... not just the standard broccoli and carrots. Lots of zucchini and cauliflower. Yum. The sauce has a lot of fresh garlic. It is so delectable. May be the best pad thai I have had in Phoenix.

Service is prompt and friendly. For lunch I am in and out under 40 minutes. They keep the fresh iced tea flowing...

I can't help but growl when co-workers ask me where I ate for lunch. ""Wild Thaiger... rowl!"""
1,"My friends and I went to the Wrigley Mansion for a luch and tour special yesterday.   We ordered our food and the first course was really good.  It was a spinach & bleu cheese salad.   The second course was Croque Madame.   It looked wonderful, but on my first taste I almost hurled!  I am not a picky eater at all, but the ham was completely rancid.  I spit it into my napkin and my 4 friends were shocked because I never send food back and I'm the opposite of  a drama queen.  That's why they were so shocked.  The waiter asked if I wanted anything else and I politely declined.   I'd lost my appetite, of course.  My friends fish was almost raw, too.    So we decided to take the tour and have coffee & dessert afterwards.  The mansion was beautiful and the guide, Ashley,  was fabulous.  I was sad to see every single room was set up as a dining room.  There were no beds or dressers anywhere.  But the art, (They have a Renoir) , the chandeliers, the view and the grounds were stunning.  We went back to eat our creme brulee's and our old watered down ice teas, waters and crumbs were still sitting there.  The waiter didn't freshen up anything while we were on the hour tour.  And there were only 2 other tables of 2 there!    So we got our desserts and coffee.   It was good so far.   Then I asked for a coffee refill and I put in my cream & sugar and took a sip and the coffee was cold!!  I was so surprised that it was so cold that I spit it in my creme brulee' cup.  Again, I'm not a drama queen.  This was just so bad.  We told the waiter the coffee was cold & he was so surprised.  DUH!  He was nice but so inept.   We'll never go back, especially to eat!   I was the worst dining experience  that I've had.   They should at least give everybody a pack of Juicy Fruit for the road.  Anyway, it was such a disappointment, and I've wanted to go there since high school."
5,"This place rocks.  I wish we had something half as good in Charlotte.  We first walked through the grocery and vendor area and were shocked at the selection, amount, price, and freshness of everything we saw.  We ate lunch at the attached restaurant...the best carne asada I have had.  Its been about a year and I still miss it."
5,"If you're looking for a super fancy place, keep looking...this is your typical neighborhood tavern and it made me feel like I was back home in the Milwaukee area.  The best burgers in Madison...hands down!  Good fries and cheese curds too...they had a number of other dishes that sounded yummy too.  Super friendly staff.  We will definitely be back!"
1,"On 4/21/14 at around 7:43PM i tried to order two 99 cent burritos and add cheese. The cashier rung up the charge to a total of $7.  :(   The cashier is a moron who can't add math.    I informed him that it is Monday and on Monday there is 99 cent special for bean burritos.   He told me no, we no longer offer that.  Then i said"" Just for today or for now on?   He said"" Yes, no longer offer that for now on"".    I looked at the table nearby and the 99 cent special is still on the coupon.    I walked out before i could start cussing him out.

 Description of cashier: Hispanic man Wearing a apron, hat and reading glasses hanging from his neck. No name tag on his shirt.

  Very bad customer service..  This same Cashier 4 weeks ago overcharged me by $3. i asked for the correct change and he gave me $2 more back.  I was so pissed at this point i just left. 


 I'm calling the manager of this restaurant to complain about this man. The manager should tell the man to change his ways or get fired.  Simple as that.

 As long as that cashier is still working at this restaurant i will not buy anything from them."
1,"I've gone to this salon several times, but this last time was a real cluster*$%^. I went in for my usual mani-pedi. TWO women worked on my hands and feet at the same time!!!!!! I was uncomfortable stretching across the giant pedicure chair so that the lady on my left could paint my fingernails over the side of the arm rest. Based on my previous encounters at this salon, and the fact that the woman doing my manicure had done a great job many times before, I let the weird tag-team of my nails go on. I smiled and acted nice, but the nail polish was old, clumpy and had hair in it... Worst manicure of my life, and the pedicure wasn't much better. This happened on a rainy Friday afternoon a couple of weeks ago and I was one of four clients at the time. Basically, those ladies shared me like I was a sandwich, each getting a somewhat small tip instead of one of them receiving the usual 20%. Moral of this story is that I won't ever be going back and I will not recommend them to anyone!"
1,"Maybe I am the most ""uncool"" person on Yelp, but I HATED this place.  A friend and I decided to meet here thinking it sounded like a chill place to have a drink, relax, go down memory lane, etc.

We drove separately and I arrived before him.  I paid a $10 cover to get inside, only to discover that ""inside"" was so dark I could not see, so packed I could not move, and playing the most INSANELY loud I-don't-even-know-what-to-call-it music I have ever heard.

Trying not to be a diva, I went to the bar and ordered a Jack on the rocks.  It took me screaming at the bartender to accomplish this feat, likely through no fault of his own.

Anyway, my buddy showed up and miraculously recognized my silhouette in the dark.  (I am a perfectly normal size 10/12 so I didn't stand out at all.)  

He ordered a drink and we stood in awkward, pitch-black, booming silence until we decided to just slam our drinks and leave.

That was the most interesting $15+ dollar Jack (including cover) I have ever had.

I don't see the appeal.  Maybe on a weekday?"
1,Disgusting!  I'd rather eat McDonald's over this place!
5,"By my calculations, it's cheaper to move long distances using an Enterprise van vs a Uhaul van.  The people at this Enterprise were incredibly helpful and friendly. My van had 200 miles on it and still smelled of new vehicle. Moving still sucks but at least my moving van did not."
5,"I was looking for good comfort food in downtown Phoenix and that is exactly what you'll find at Welcome Diner. The staff was friendly, the environment was cozy and the food was too good to not finish! I can't wait to come back with a crowd to share such an experience!"
5,This place is the best. Americano is ridiculously good.
1,"RUN!!! Not only am I being charged 4X what I was told... he hit a nerve and I cannot feel part of my face. I was told.. oooh no big deal, it will come back in 6 weeks. It has now been 4 months and I still do not have full feeling restored. I was sent to collections without even getting my last bill in the mail. Please save your FACE and yourself major aggravation."
5,Great service! in and out very plessant service.  wish i lived closer to this store.. the people in this store were wonderful...
5,Their red bean and rice are fabulous and the portion is super generous!  I also had the Kentucky Thoroughbred cocktail and it was amazing.  There's something about sitting knee to knee with strangers at a nine-person diner counter talking about food and life and watching the chef's work in the teensy-tiny kitchen.  But don't worry - if you need some space and want to enjoy the amazing AZ weather there's a HUGE patio and fun little order window... something for everyone!  For dessert I got the homemade biscuit with goat cheese and apple butter.  The biscuit was warm but the cheese was cold and that was a weird combination.  But overall everything was delicious and I will totally be back!!!
5,"OK I cannot speak for all their food, but their Adam RIchmond Big Unit hot dog was the best hot dog I have EVER had. It is really that good. 100% beef, goodness. 

Great place for a beer  before heading to Chase field too."
1,"The sales people in this place are the rudest I have ever seen! I walked in there and I was ready to purchase a RDX after doing research online; all I needed was a test drive to make my decision. First I was waiting for 30min so somebody would help me, and then when they did they treated me very badly and were hesitant to let me do a test drive. Then once we finally went to test the car, the sales man that was helping me made a comment like - this car was fully redesigned and Acura wants to target young and successful people - as if we weren't successful enough or good enough to buy the car. EXCUSE ME? So because I look young you assume I don't have enough to buy the car? I was very offended and disgusted, since I was very interested in that car. In the end I went to another zimbrick in town and purchased another car. On fish hatchery road they treated me very well, and aided me with all my needs.
I am very offended and was never mistreated in such way in my entire life."
1,"Says it's Kosher, but apparently only sometimes.   I Googled ""kosher bakery phoenix"" and Karsh's popped up. So I made the visit to the shop, preparing to find something suitable for passover. I arrived and was met at the door by the sign, ""Sorry. Our products are not suitable for passover. Everything is made with flour, bla bla bla"" I'm paraphrasing. So I went inside, wondering if it was an April Fool's joke. Although the store was COMPLETELY empty, I mean, barren of all lifeforms, the surly girl behind the counter took her time asking if she could help me. Our exchange proved that it was no joke. They could not help me. No yummy kosher flourless chocolate cake would be in my immediate future. They were kosher - just not for Passover. Lovely. I should've Googled ""kosher bakery Scottsdale."""
1,"So, this is a long story, but I'll do my best. Brought the girlfriend's Passat in to have the service light checked, a/c checked, and it was making a strange noise. Wheel bearings, ac leak fixed, oil changed and tires rotated. Pickup car, service light still on, and makes a different funny noise. Call up, they have us bring it back, apologizing for the light, and thinking they just need to balance the tires. I thought that was automatically done after a rotation, but hey, I'm no mechanic! Offered a free oil change on her truck as compensation, and since she had brought it in anyway for its own a/c issue, she was happy with that. 

This ordeal lasted over a week, dealing with multiple employees and manager. The first guy that worked on the Passat apparently quit that day, the next guy had to leave because his wife had a baby, etc. 

Eduardo told her that all her hoses needed replaced and several other things, before he gave her a diagnosis of the problem we brought it in for in the first place. At this point, we just want to pick it up. So we do, and now the airbag light is blinking. Manager (Seth) refused to speak to us and then we were hung up on. 

Pretty ridiculous. Not sure if this is because we are women or what, but us being female shouldn't have anything to do with the fact they don't seem capable of fixing a problem without causing a new one. Francisco was the only person there worth talking to. He was great, but sadly there were too many other things wrong."
1,Nice Staff but that's about all. Would never stay here again
1,"Tried this because it's local.  Terrible, bland Chinese food.  Not much else to say.  Will never return.  My wife wanted me to mention her sweet and sour chicken, which was battered fried chicken pieces with a side of sauce in a bowl.  When she asked where the vegetables were (like the picture), she was told there is a piece of pineapple in the sauce and that is what comes with it.  As promised, we looked hard into the sauce and found one very small piece of pineapple.  Bon Appetite."
5,"""Ummm Good. Yummy. Tasty. What is this delicious piece? Do you wanna try this? It's good.""

Those are pretty much what my bf and I said to each other during our Valentine's day dinner. No footsies or romantic hand holding but just shuffling forks with an extreme eager to try each other's plate. Vin Santo is THAT good. 

I got seafood Ravioli with pine nuts, which completely blew me away. It is by far the best Italian food I've ever had. They made their own bread: crisp and tender. Their Tiramisu will brighten up all of your taste bulbs. Appetizers and desserts are made for sharing, so be friendly to each other, less conservative and share. Go make a reservation now. You'll love this place."
1,"I was quoted $75 to clean a household dryer vent, plus $10 trip fee, plus tax.  When the tech arrived, I was told that it would be another $50 for him to go on the roof to blow the stand pipe clean.  I agreed to overcharge, but he did not have a ladder. I went and fetched a ladder, and he said the flex hose on the back of the dryer was too long.  I asked him to cut it to the proper length after he blew it clear.  He did not have any duct tape!  End cost using my equipment. $147 plus.  100% over the advertized price."
5,"Dr. Austin is an amazing physician.  She is compassionate, caring and thorough.  She is the only physician in her office, which means when she needs to provide more time to patients before you, you will wait.  But guess what, one day that may be you--you may need that extra time.  So I have never once been upset if my appointment wasn't started at the exact minute it was scheduled.  She has been my primary doctor for over seven years and unless she retires, she will be my primary physician for the foreseeable future.  If your treatment requires more specialized treatment, she knows who and where to send you.  As a middle aged man I purposely chose Dr. Austin because she is smart, compassionate, listens, thorough and has never once said ""fully booked"" when I've asked to see her for ANY reason that day.

If you are looking for a great doctor, Dr. Austin is it 100%."
5,"I am not really reviewing Taco Bell am I. Yup, I am. After coming here 2-3 times a week for about 7 years - I think i have the lay of the land...

I get food fast, food is good enough, always cheap, never had a problem, very well managed.

I could eat bean burritos pretty much every day - and some weeks, I do."
1,Bar is okay and the atmosphere is nice.  Food is below average and pricey. Our food was cold and when we commented on that the sever didn't seem to care.
5,"Ever since moving out to Milwaukee I've had a craving for this place. I wish I could get back to Madison a little bit more often just to make another trip to Smoky Jon's.

Walking in it's clear what your in for. Jon has rib credentials! The walls are covered in awards and certificates the guy has won. Best sauce, best ribs,  best this, best that. You don't get the awards this place has without knowing what you're doing.

I almost always get the ribs (because how can you not?). The sauce has just enough heat to really compliment the ribs. I've tried a few of the sandwiches, but I always end up coming back to the ribs because that's where this place really shines. 

The sides are also very good. The potato salad and coleslaw are my favorites. I'm also big fan of the BBQ Baked Beans. The french fries are good enough if you get takeout from Smoky's (just because they travel a bit better than something like cole slaw), but with so much other great stuff to try you are really ripping yourself off if you stick to them.

This is definitely one of my favorite places in Madtown."
1,"Ordered Chicken Fried Steak for my free birthday meal. That probably shows my foodie ignorance, as who knows what meat is tucked in that fried, breaded coating with gravy. The whole plate was worse than I remember chow hall food when I was in the military. I sent the iced tea (probably another poor choice) back.

""How was everything?"" the cashier asked when I left. 

""Free,"" I said.

""Oh good, glad you enjoyed it."" 

I let it go."
5,My boyfriend and I made a trip to Wisconsin Dells for my birthday and stopped here on the way back to Chicago to get some cheese. All of the employees here were extremely helpful and friendly. Cheese was decent priced and delicious. I'd recommend it.
5,"The Heard Museum is probably one of the best we have ever been in!

The history of the indigenous First Nation people in North America is both sad and very compelling.  And, the collection the Heard family has assembled and the museum has added to is incredible.  Yet, it's the little exhibits that move me the most.  I am still brought to tears whenever at the end of touring, I come to the hand crafted dolls of the US Marine WWII Navajo code talkers raising the American flag (See photos).

On our most recent trip here, we enjoyed the Barry Goldwater Bolo Tie exhibit, and  listening to the tour guide of First Nation peoples in Arizona.

BTW, the best deal is becoming a Member of the Heard by showing your AAA card.  It's a small discount but you get their magazine and newsletter.

Enjoy!"
5,"Went to Welcome Diner for the first time this past Saturday. They had a veggie burger on special that I really wanted to try, but sadly they ran out before we got there. Instead I got the vegan po-boy sandwich with a side of fries (which i'm so happy I chose). It was so yummy, and super filling! The menu has lots of great comfort food items, including some vegetarian/vegan options. 

The staff was awesome and super friendly. The place has such a neat vibe as well. There's truly nothing like it!"
1,"I have been to practically every spa and salon in the valley searching for a great nail salon.  My friend worked at the Village as a camp counselor and he suggested I check their salon out.  I was sadly disappointed.

When I originally called to make an appointment the receptionist was rather rushed and sounded inconvenienced by my call.  I am an understanding person so I didn't really think much of it.  My friend and I went in on the day of our appointment and were still asked to wait for about 20 minutes because the nail tech hadn't come back.  Again, I am not really impatient or unreasonable so it didn't really bothered me.

The thing that pushed me over the edge was the nail tech.  My friend was getting a pricier manicure and the tech was very personable and friendly to her.  Because I had gotten my nails done only a week earlier I asked for an express manicure instead.  She rushed through and was extremely rude to me.  I definitely walked out with a bad taste in my mouth about the whole experience and was not happy when I still was paying a relatively high price for my manicure.

Maybe I caught everyone on a bad day but I would suggest looking somewhere else unless you absolutely have to get your nails done um, at a health club?"
1,"Three things you should know before you go. 1) They will call you a month before surgery and tell you that the price has gone up, mine went up $5000.The eventually honored the original quote after being convinced by my orthodontist and only after I said I would find another surgeon.  2) They have no concern about your ""health"" only their portfolio, I went in after surgery several times regarding being extremely congested, I told him something was wrong. He prescribed me an antibiotic, when I went to pick it up, he prescribed me something which is the equivalent of penicillin, it is noted on all records in his office not to do so, as I am HIGHLY allergic to penicillin. Had I not read the label and taken it I would have ended up in the hospital. (Point three will circle back to number two)   3) They will call you non stop for ""final photos"" I agreed to finally go in only because I still have no feeling on my bottom teeth and I am still congested.  I wanted to discuss it with him, I told this to the receptionist when I called (she sounded concerned, she wasn't) to schedule the appointment. The moment I walked in, they rushed to take the photos he walked in, I began to tell him my ""concerns"" he said, ""well the feeling may never come back, you look great"" tapped me on the back said good luck and left, I didn't even have a chance to tell him about my congestion. I left there feeling like such a fool, I paid over 20K and he couldn't give me 5 minutes.  The next day I found a specialist, I received two shots in each nostril and was sent for a CAT scan. I received the results today.  They are so infected that I am scheduled for surgery on Wednesday. They can no longer be treated with antibiotics. I never had any issues before jaw surgery, if Dr. Day would have listened to the countless times I told him I was congested, my infection could have been treated prior to me now needing surgery. Side bar. As far as the results from the surgery (upper and lower jaw) I have no complaints for the actual work, I just wish I would have had selected a Dr. based on the whole package, client care, follow up etc. not someone who does great work to build his portfolio. Well done, Dr. Day!"
5,"Quick, friendly, and thorough. I was in and out in less than 15 minutes and baby Wyatt looked (almost) brand spankin' new again. :P They really do stand by their promise of having your car out of there in under 14 minutes! 

$20 for the most inclusive package is not a bad deal at all - especially if you think you'll be back within 3-5 days for another wash because you get a HUGE discount ($2.99/wash if you bring your car back in 3 days or less). I figure I'll pay for the whole $20 shebang a few times a year, and use the basic package in between these washes just to maintain the shine. Seriously, you cannot beat these prices!

Remember to leave a few extra bucks as tip, they deserve it. (:"
1,"I've never seen so many fat, ugly people working in one place and all of them doing nothing.  Yet another store that claims to carry PC games but couldn't tell me when or if ever they would carry a major-market PC game expansion.  This is my 2nd trip there, the last time they tried to sell me a laptop with Vista despite a quick explanation that we were just trying to see if they had any XP inventory.  

Ug."
1,"This place was recommended by a soon to be non-friend. 

Portions were small, prices were big, taste was average, server was uninterested borderline annoyed, nothing to write home about. I won't be back. Nuf said!"
1,"So you're with a bunch of people who like chicken fried steak, and they say, hey theres this steak house you should try with us. This should be your first warning. If a steak house is known for its chicken fried steak, something is not right.

Maybe you're different, maybe you think, sure, they like chicken fried steak, and I like fried asshole. Then this is your place!

Now, you go in, and ahh the ambiance, shit on the walls as far as the eye can see, oh and not just the walls, the ceiling as well! Its jam packed, you can't hear the person in front of you, you're thinking, when's the last time they dusted all this crap? How much falls in my food from the lazy ceiling fans. 

Its hot and a bit humid to, maybe to recreate that true texas experience?

So you order your tbone, medium rare, side of mashed potatoes and hell, some okra while you're at it. Good okra is hard to find in these parts.

The okra, crispy, soft inside (once its done being molten lava), perfect. Don't bother with the sauce unless your garnish for okra is tartar sauce.

Hey, a side salad come with it! Oh, the tiny diced tomatoes, ice burg lettuce, and what an interesting mix, diced green olives all over the top, in giant piles.

Now your entree comes, but the waitress, if you're lucky, has worked there 4 years! Shes got a blond dye job, too much eye makeup, and a perm. She makes sure to leave every single dish on the table, just in case you missed one delicious crumb. At some point she might drop by one basket of rolls, for a table of 8. The buttermilk ones taste homemade, not bad!

Oh yes, the entree, a tbone, super thin, in what is that? Its pooling everywhere, oh god the grease. You did order your steak with a large slathering of grease right? Well those mashed potatoes, which are thick and standard, are drenched in heavy white gravy, and all the blandness of the gravy helps soak up all that grease!

So you're almost done with your food, omg, your giant glass is empty? Where was that waitress? Oh don't worry, just grab her by the arm and she'll try to remember to refill your drink. And those extra plates, well if they're really bothering you you can ask a bus person to take them, though you might as well be asking them to lick your shoe (or eat what you just did). 

Now you're full, you've paid, and because of its ""prime"" location, you get to cross a busy intersection to get to the car you had to park across the street. 

Might as well just wait to get home to pee too, its sweltering in there, more crap on the walls and ceiling, and you pretty much have to stand on the toilet to get the stall door closed."
5,Had a wonderful lunch.  Excellent.
5,"Stumbled across Zoes on our way out of town, we're touring musicians so fresh, fast, inexpensive food is super important to us on the road. We got excited as soon as we walked in the door. You could smell the freshness!

We had a hard time deciding, but I had the spinach wrap with chicken and Greg had the turkey reuben. Both were fabulous, and the fresh slaw with feta side was fantastic as well. We so wish we had a place like this at home!"
1,"The food is absolutely dreadful. I ordered a cheeseburger and it was undoubtedly not only the worst cheeseburger but probably the worst meal I have ever eaten in my entire life. The place has this really strange odor when you walk in, and I should have left when it hit my nostrils. However, I thought I would give it a chance. Big mistake. The service was good."
1,"This place is cheesy, cheesy ""Daryl's O.K. used cars"" type of feel. They have about 67 sketchy characters trying to wash your car at once, and the end result is a car with water spots? I was very upset with how poorly they handled the simple task of washing my car. The worst part of the whole thing: THEY STOLE 6 QUARTERS I HAD IN MY CUP-HOLDER!! If you are a recently paroled felon, or person who has no hope for a decent shot at a career- get a job at Danny's on E Highland Ave. I tried this because my regular car wash is closed on Sundays.. I would recommend everyone go to Hot Shots on 16th street. The management there has some integrity requirements when they hire employees."
1,"I will never deal with these people again. In a town like Madison, where are so many decent bike shops, why would I?

I went because I got a flat.

Trip #1. My boyfriend drops off my bike on a Monday. They say they can't have it ready until the NEXT Thursday (11 days). The also say they're going to lube the brake lines. 

Trip #2. My boyfriend comes by to pick up the bike, as stated, a week and a half later. They haven't even touched it yet. They say, ""Did we call you? We'll call you."" They had never told him to wait until they called. He says that they seem to have totally forgotten about the bike. 

A few hours later, they call.

Trip #3. He gets the bike. My flat is fixed. $43 dollars.

I get on the bike to ride it to work. The front brake is rubbing. There were no problems with the brakes when we gave the bike to them.

Trip #4. I have to go back to have them adjust the brakes. The guy running the show takes about 20 seconds. Hands it back to me. ""There you go."" He says. By the time I get home, the brake is rubbing again, now worse than before. 

I call and say, ""Can you tell me how to adjust this? I cannot come to the bike store for a 5th time."" He says, ""Well, there must be something seriously wrong with your brakes if we adjusted them and they're still rubbing."" There was nothing wrong with my brakes before I handed the bike over to them. At this point, I am so angry I can barely see straight. 

Trip #5. I take the bike in. They take it aside, work on it for 2 minutes, and viola! the brakes work. There's nothing wrong with them. They were just incorrectly adjusted twice. 

I'm sorry to have to give a bad review to my local bike shop, but our experience was that they were disorganized and took three times to get something right."
5,"Have to add my voice to the chorus of MBP lovers.  I somehow missed this place in the many times I've been to Madison until a few years ago.

Great food, lots of vegetarian and vegan options.  They have breakfast all day and quite a few hot veggie sandwiches.   I finished my meal with banana cream pie, but they have vegan fruit pies and ice cream treats."
5,"I just learned that they are now open on Saturday's. YEAH! My Mom and I stopped there for lunch today (Saturday), and it was empty. As we ate, a few more people stopped in. I don't think everyone knows they are open on Saturday's yet, but hopefully the business will pick up. 

I discovered this place thanks to some friends at work. Since my first visit, I've never been disappointed. I always order the Chicken Picado Pita and it is always so delicious! Just the right chicken to pepper and onion ratio. The pitas are fresh, the tzatziki sauce superb and their french fries are magnificent -- crispy outside and melt-in-your-mouth buttery inside. Although I've yet to venture outside my own menu choices, they have plenty of items to choose from and I'm sure just as delicious.

The staff is friendly and accommodating. The parking is limited if you get there on a busy day, but otherwise it isn't too hard to find a spot. Like others have mentioned, it is right on the light-rail route so the location is great too.  They even have a small patio out front where you can enjoy your food and the Phoenix weather (when permitting). 

If you are out and about in the downtown area during the week or Saturday, definitely give Athenian Express a try. It is one of those affordable, quality food gems that you shouldn't miss out on."
1,"Dear Miracle Mile,

This is the last time you will ever sucker another $15 bucks from me for bland, over-salted cafeteria food. I hate to be the rabid cur of dissent in this love fest, but I can no longer fake it and go with the flow. I despise everything about you, Miracle Mile.

Unless someone had cued me into the fact, I never would have guessed that you were trying so hard to duplicate NY deli-style fare. Why so? Because every NY staple I've tried from your fetid excuse for a deli has sucked so effing hard it just about pulls grey matter out through my ears. 

Stale and mealy defrosted cheesecake that was as unappetizing to look at as to consume. Matzo ball soup so bland I had to keep looking down to assure myself I was indeed consuming something other than hot air. Wilted salads guaranteed to deflate my hopes upon first bite. Vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent. Are you trying that hard to fade into the background, you wallflower? It's no wonder the median age of a patron in your restaurant is pushing 80. The near total annihilation of my taste buds is the only way I would ever step foot through your doors again.

And then there's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich, Mile. Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches piled (not so) high with bland, fatty meat that's been slopped with reckless abandon atop your choice of bread, guaranteed to disintegrate in five seconds flat. All topped off with a slice of sweaty Swiss cheese that adds zero flavor and flops listlessly atop a piteous excuse for a sandwich. If it weren't for the spicy mustard at each table, I'd hardly have tasted anything at all! Bravo! You surely deserve an award for the most poorly constructed sandwich in all of Phoenix! 

Although I guess that dubious honor should clearly be bestowed upon your brusque, monosyllabic cafeteria line workers. ""Next? Bread?"" Unappetizing slop of meat, slid down the line to the next guy. ""Fries?"" Heap of fried garbage, liberally applied, slid down the line. That is, unless you're asking for something outside of the crap-sandwich-and-fries box. At that point your request will be wordlessly acquiesced to with a scowl and a slop. ""Drink?"" No! Please! NO! Just get me out of this slovenly pit of cafeteria hell. What do you want, I'll pay anything! Anything!

Wait a tic. That's your whole ploy all along, isn't it Miracle Mile? Brainwash the masses with mediocre food and overcharge for everything to make it seem like it's a privilege to be dining upon such slop.

Well I'm on to you. I've given you plenty of chances, Mile. Your Reuben was the only sandwich that didn't make me want to violently upend tacky cafeteria tables on the way to my car. 

Wishing you the bland, inoffensive dreams of an automaton,
Erica"
5,I've been using this salon exclusively for the past six or seven years because of how Rose the owner and her staff treat me. I've never had to redo a single nail - and over the years I've tried everything! Don't let the poor reviewers stop you from visiting this shop. Just expect to wait because she's busy with repeat customers. And new ones.
5,"I'm not sure how many times I've been here, but it's a lot.
I've always had an interest and an appreciation for history. Being a Phoenix native I've been curious about the area's history.  I have two boys (12 and 9) who also like going here there's plenty to keep a child interested especially if you take the time to explain the exhibits in their terms.

Heard never fails to satisfy my history itch.  There are a number of permanent exhibits and they change things up a bit every so often to give you a good reason to return. Visit their website to see what's going on.  I don't know how many artifacts and pieces of Native American and Southwest art they have in their collection, but it's certainly in the thousands.  As you stroll through the museum to see the displays and read a bit about the history you can't help but put yourself in the time period and imagine what life must have been like.

If you're visiting the Phoenix area from a location that doesn't have something like the Heard and you want to go home with some knowledge of Native American and Southwest art I highly recommend a visit to Heard."
5,"Clean, nice rooms, great breakfast cafe in lobby, nice looking pool and gym. About 15 minutes from downtown Madison."
5,"I can't believe that there are ANY negative reviews of Honey Bear's!  I've been a customer for decades, having started when the owners and founders were smoking meat in a converted 50-gal. drum outside the original East Phoenix location.

I now frequent the Central Ave. location and the food is still as good as it's always been.  

If all that matters to you is ambiance, this is probably not the place for you. Honey Bear's is all about the food.

Someone complained that the pork was too soggy.  Another that the pork was too dry.  HOW can it be both??  The pulled pork IS ""soggy"" because it's JUICY!  Honey Bear's pulled pork is to DIE for!

Someone actually dissed the barbecue sauce!  I've been hitting barbecue joints from the Mississippi to all points west, and HB's sauce is hands-down the best I've ever found.  

The only complaint I have is that when I tried to order the baby back ribs (the best thing that has ever been in my mouth), I was told that they are no longer carrying them but are now offering spare ribs.  So, I tried the spare ribs and, while they are good, they just don't compare to the baby backs.

I had never tasted ""collard greens"", so I decided to try them.  Now I'm hooked.  Since I liked them so much at HB's, I ordered them when I went to Notorious P.I.G., another barbecue restaurant. I had to throw those away...they were loaded with vinegar.

I will continue to buy the mouth watering pulled pork, pulled chicken, and collard greens from Honey Bear's even though I now live miles away (and right between two other BBQ restaurants).  And, for other HB's fans, ""Deal Chicken"" frequently offers coupons for Honey Bear's which cost $15 for $30 worth of food.  Beat THAT!"
5,"I love the Capital Brewery because I think it encompasses everything that is quintessentially Wisconsin. Capital Brewery makes consistently high-quality German lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for good measure), and provides a low-key, no-frills environment that can be whatever you want it to be. The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table. And if the weather's not so nice, you can visit the Bier Stube, Capital's indoor bar, which is full of dark, rich wood and nice people. I highly recommend the Capital Brewery. And don't forget to take the short tour!"
1,"Had a cracked line on my ac unit - got charged $100 to find it, and then the quote was for $1150 and was told to replace my entire AC system instead of fixing it.  Got a second opinion from another place and they said it was just a $400 fix including a recharge.  All Comfort Services quoted me $500 in refrigerant alone."
1,"I'd hate to waste a star on this place!

I lived right outside of The French Quarter in New Orleans for 8 months. I remember the best of Cajun food and this place was far from what I remember. I'm not big on seafood but everyone at our table ordered a seafood dish and all were not happy with their entree.

What did I order? I ordered a simple Chicken Po'boy sandwich. How can a Cajun restaurant get this wrong? This place did. The chicken was placed on bread that was hard. I expected the chicken to be smothered in BBQ sauce. Wrong! The sauce was on the side. The lettuce on the side of dish that was to be used in the sandwich was a bit on the brown side. The fries were cold. Yuck!

Waitress was great. She was the best part of this dining experience. Never again."
1,"Um.  No.  

I can't bring myself to give any more than one star:  It had air conditioning and chairs to sit on.  The chairs didn't break when we sat on them.  The air conditioning worked.  

Wait staff was absolutely horrible (made us wait very long time before we even got menus, then got distracted when it came time to pay the check).  

I swear this kitchen belongs on kitchen nightmares.  The salad was downright scary (I didn't eat it because I didn't want to get sick), the water glasses had COFFEE STAINS ON THEM (how does that even happen?!), and what edible food there was was simply average.

Manager solicited our feedback then CUT US OFF after we got 3 words out.  (Us: ""Well, we kinda ... "" Him (interrupting): ""Thank you for your business"")

Yeah.  If you see this place, don't walk -- RUN to a different restaurant."
1,"In my opinion, Charter Communications is just terrible.  They have been unreliable, unhelpful, rude and incapable of providing an acceptable level of service.  The customer service representatives are like talking to pre-programed robots, even in the midst of a prolonged service outage, their main goal is to sell more worthless services. Avoid this company like the plague."
1,"The worst car wash in town.  Please do not give them your business.  I have had two major issues the past two times I have visited, followed up with customer service afterward, only to be passed off with a generic response and no attempt at rescuing our business.  The first experience was a few years back - we bought a detailing package, they did a terrible job, and when I contacted them afterward, they basically said ""sorry, but there's nothing we can do about it"".  I didn't return until today as they had a coupon for an oil change & car wash online & I was in the area - I figured I would give them another chance.  I was overcharged for the services, the wash was very poor, and again I reached out with my feedback and received a very similar message from the exact same customer service rep from a few years back, stating basically ""sorry it was a bad experience, but hopefully next time we'll do a better job"".  I will NEVER return here - terrible customer service, terrible service, terrible signage (who knows where to go when you get to this place?) -- there are a ton of better options in the area, no need to give them a third chance (or first if you've never been)."
5,"If I could give them ten stars, I would. BEAUTIFUL. And, FREE!!! 
When I got there, the tram was waiting and available. I asked if I should take it, or walk.. The driver was super helpful-telling me it isn't a long walk, and pointing out things on the map I could see that the tram doesn't go to (some of the paths are more foot paths). 
The gardens are all so pretty. Just wonderful and peaceful. The Thai garden, with the golden pavilion and fountains, was definitely my favorite. 
There was also a mallard duck mama who was sitting on her nest in the rose garden. I was in heaven. 
I also paid the $2 fee to go to the conservatory, where I saw tiny baby quail! So cute! The tropical plants were beautiful. However, I only saw the butterflies recent hatched in the case-not one in the conservatory itself. 
Two small drawbacks: maps cost $0.25. I am not complaining about the cost, per se. But I only had a $5, and they seemed annoyed by this. Also, none of the items in the gift shop had the Olbrich name on it. I collect Christmas ornaments from everywhere I go (just the city, not every single place), and I would have loved to have had something from there, since this was above and beyond my favorite place in Madison. They had some generic things, but like I said, I like a memento."
1,"I went here once with a friend.

We had the lunch buffet which was average. 

Until, I saw two cockroaches crawling around. Not, even your normal cockroaches but, gigantic cockroaches.

I couldn't eat anymore but, for some odd reason my other friend did."
5,"What a great little spot, and certainly helps that it's free admission. Very enjoyable place, esp the beautiful rose garden, and the Thai Pavilion, reportedly the only one in North America. It is quite gleaming."
5,"I have been to plenty of spaghetti factory restaurants in Cali, but none were as good as this place. The service was excellent, and the food was delicious. The prices are superb as well."
5,"Amazing. 
a. If you impress me with a chicken breast you are doing a DAMN good job. 
b. Spanish plate with Manchego, Serrano, date-bread and all types of other goodness = epic.
c Basil and gin martini, wtf so odd but awesome... and i hate gin!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hU6sN5r6vayqm_RMgvPGOQ?select=1641PJE2BHJbwTD1t6z2PA
d. Todd and the nice manager lady, both good peoples. 
c. Did i mention AMAZING chicken breast, yes i am actually raving about CHICKEN... granted chicken with lemon piccata, capers, arugula, and home made 'gnocchi' which were more like a pretzel bread than a gnocchi but none the less amazing.
d. OH and pumpkin bread pudding... wow.. effing wow. 

Go for the page-long cheese menu and affordable yet varied wine selection.  I can not believe this place has been here for five years and i just now visited it. The Spanish plate, two cocktails, two glasses of wine, two entrees and a desert was only a bill... cant get that in LA."
5,"Love it. Hole-in-the-wall with Peking duck on demand. Try the greens and the snapper sauteed with ginger and scallions. Great noodles, too."
5,"Just visited for the first time. Dan is fantastic!! Great service and great price. I'll be back...you should go, too."
5,"Really extensive Native American Indian museum in Phoenix.  The cover all aspects of history, culture, and just about anything else.  Went here with my Australian friend because he was interested in it.  A lot of the material will be familiar for anyone who's grown up with it as part of history class, but even so, the exhibits are very well done and you'll learn a lot.  Definitely recommend the museum if you're in the area.  The student discount was also pretty sweet."
1,"One of the worse places to get your Caddy serviced.  Been a buying customer of Coulter's since 1968, but service sucks!  Only used them because of vehicle warranties.  Their 17-point inspection is a joke.  Every time we've gotten back our Caddy, we find our fluids are low or empty.  Even our wiper blades needed replacing & they said nothing.  They replaced our front brakes resulting a horrific noise & vibration as soon as we drove out.  We took it back & they said nothing was wrong with them.  We took it to a AAA location & they fixed the problem.  Coulter needs to fix ""their problem"" because we are changing Caddy dealerships."
1,"I stopped in one day when I first moved here and sampled a couple of things, the chicken teriyaki, the fried gyoza, and some kind of drink. Nothing was fresh, everything tasted like old fryer grease or freezerburn (except my drink). To their credit, the service was immaculate. The women who helped me was super friendly and made suggestions of things I should try on my next visit (when pigs fly). I am really amazed by the positive reviews here. Unfortunately, this place is just a couple blocks from my house so I have to deal with the nasty stench from their deep fryer when I walk to the lightrail on my way to work."
5,"I am a semi-regular customer here, as I live in the neighborhood. Other than the typical music as background noise, the place is relatively quiet and, for me, an ideal study spot on Sundays. Just enough sunlight comes through the rear doors. Past those doors is the popular outdoor seating. There are a few ""Little Free Libraries."" Bikers can appreciate the location, as it lies adjacent to the Capital City Trail. Electrical outlets are usually easy to access except during the busy hours when the seating along the wall is taken."
1,"I consider myself a good fan of Panda Express, but at this location in not going again, I order like always my regular rice  with teriyaki chicken n cream cheese, but this time, the chicken wasn't ready so they told me I had to wait n that was fine for me I wasn't on a hurry, but I guess they tough I didn't want to wait, by the time I started eating I find out my chicken wasn't good it was acceptable but far away from the regular quality I can expect from them, but to make worst my rice didn't had any trace of salt. I went to the counter n I let the lady know about my findings, but she tried n said ""you're right Sir. it's unsalted but that's the way it is."" I definitely didn't expect that answer, my meal cost me around $8 n I was really hungry, so I didn't want the situation to escalate for that amount, but for sure my last visit to this location..."
5,"This is the best selection of Mexican and Latin American goods that I could find around Dane County. Not only do they have all the frijoles and hot sauces I could need, but the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. When I lived downtown, I'd head all the way out to Monona so that I could be guaranteed a fine selection of ripe avocados. 

As far as cost is concerned, I suppose it all depends on how hungry you are. It is, after all, a grocery store."
5,"MHoly crap this place is amazing!  Best meat selection in Madison. Tons of brats! Awesome service too!
Weekly he has a 10 for $10 burger special, which is amazing, and our first time, we only bought 2 burgers (yummy pizza ones) and he gave us 2 buns!  Today we got jalapeno/cheddar burgers, brat patties, and chipotle burgers, plus 4 Hawaiian brats (they have pineapple in them)! All of that was $16!
We also put an order in for an upcoming special they are having--12 sirloins for $20 and 10 lbs of jalapeno/cheddar brats for $3.99/lb.
I am so glad that my man and I found this gem... If you love both traditional cuts and innovative hybrids, check out Jims!
Ps, Jim is a super nice guy too, who loves his business and does it well!"
5,"The price is right, the food is all excellent.  The Panko white fish is what I had today, and had the Chicken Terryaki bowl in the past.  The women who work here are so so sweet, they are always so sweet to my son, which is worth 2 stars to me.  Every time you leave, they thank you for your business, and that just makes the food you burp up taste even better.    Plus when you are done eating you can walk across the street to the library and get your learn on.

I think what you will gather by my reviews is I like simple places that are cheap.  I like the fou fou stuff on occasion as well, but I like working class type people to make me my food, because they usually do it with love and passion.   Unless you're talking about Filibertos, where I found a rusty staple in my food once."
1,"NOT reputable business. Keep playboys around as reading material for guests. Charged me for services I didn't ask for and didn't know I was paying for.

I went in for a haircut, during my visit the gal trimming my hair also trimmed my beard and eye brows; she didn't ask so I assumed it was included. The haircut was good; no better or worse than camelback barbershop near bestbuy or a&d near 7th st and camelback. 

While paying I was charged extra for the beard and brow trim services. She WAS going to get a better tip, but changed my mind when I found that I was charged for that service.

I don't plan to return here and one star only due to this shady practice. Otherwise it's an ok place for a cut, just be sure and tell them you don't want extra stuff if you're not planning to pay for it.

My wife was waiting for me while I was getting my haircut and after we left, I found out that most of the magazines available for reading while you wait were playboys. In my opinion, a reputable business should NOT keep this type of material around. Then again, I wouldnt really consider this a reputable business."
1,"The most horrible pedi ever and it cost me $45 because I sat in the"" special massage chair"" wtf why didn't they inform me when I sat it their f^*&% special piece of crap chair. The pedei lasted 15 minutes and it looked horrible......very sloppy looking. I had my nails done there a couple of years ago and they were yellow! I should have known better but I was right by there so I went. My suggestion is to never step foot in this rat hole of a"" business"" the people and service suck. I give it negative 5 stars. Go to andys down the street, I've been going for years and they aren't expensive."
1,"The food sucks. Everything has a sickly sweet taste, mostly due to the cheap BBQ sauce they use. The ribs were mostly bone and gristle, hardly enough to feed a starving dog."
5,"I came here because of the other positive reviews, and I'm so glad that I did. I was in a bad situation with my taxes and felt incredibly anxious and not up to dealing with the problem. Duane Beckett and the others in the office made me feel better right away. They were completely nonjudgmental about the many mistakes I'd made in dealing with my situation, resolved my problem 100% (including dropping off my state taxes themselves!), and charged me what I thought was an incredibly low rate. 

(They charge significantly less, and were *significantly* more professional, than another accountant I'd seen earlier.)

Thanks to their help, I'm not sure whether I will actually even need an accountant again in the forseeable future, but if I do I have absolutely no question about where I'll go."
5,"Walking into Red is a serious problem for most: you're confronted with what is easily the most beautiful selection of vintage furniture in Phoenix... and the prices are astronomical. I used to complain about this until I became aware of what the going prices are for the same exact items in coastal cities. Phoenix: we got it good; stop complaining.

We recently showed our home for the first time on a historic home tour. A Tudor Revival built in 1931, we've always struggled to find the right furniture, accents and fixtures to fit the antique style with our modern tastes. We went to Red hoping just to find some inspiration, but after explaining to the owner what we were doing, he offered to send someone to review our space.

We ended up with a suede 60's era danish couch and two leather chairs that made the rest of our interior look downright stupid. We ended up redecorating, paint and all, to better suit the new furniture. It was a lot of work but well worth it.

We now are on the verge of a full-blown vintage furniture addiction that is only being held back by our income. I've actually considered putting off plans to travel the world and raise a family in order to get the perfect coffee table."
5,"I began coming here in 2005 because it was the closest gym to where I was living at the time.  But even after I moved out of the area, I knew I had found ""my gym"" and I've never gone anywhere else since. Even after I moved to Chicago, when I come back to AZ for lengthy visits, I get a month to month membership here every time. 

I highly recommend giving CPSAC a try, especially if you're tired of the ""mainstream"" gyms or just want a better overall gym experience.  Plus they have a Cold Plunge which is getting harder and harder to find in a gym nowadays.  These people actually KNOW what they are doing and what muscle building and muscle building recovery is all about.  For my money, this is the best gym in town."
1,"As a loyal (former) patron of Harvey's Wineburger for over 40 years, I can now announce that the change of ownership in the past year or so has murdered the magnet that kept customers coming back - their hamburgers.  A good friend was in Harvey's in the past month, and ask me to go there with him today.  He said on his previous visit, he got a lousy hamburger and suspected something had changed.  His assessment was quite accurate.

The first thing you notice when the burger is delivered is that the bun has shrunk and that the burger patty has become perfectly round, as compared to its 'jagged' predecessor, and flattened - maybe pre-formed and frozen?  The first bite discloses the sad news:  the meat is tasteless, rubbery, and absolutely nothing like the burger that has kept the joint in business 40-plus years.  Astonishingly, you can no longer taste any hint of wine in the burger.  My guess is that the rubbery consistency of the meat (they OBVIOUSLY have changed their supplier and/or grade) rejects the wine poured on it like water on Bullfrog sunscreen.    

We had heard about the ownership change several months ago with someone commenting that ""oriental owners"" had taken over.  The smaller microwaved-tasting bun and the Birkenstock meat are clear signs the new ownership has resorted to use of cheap ingredients - specifically the meat - the landmark's staple - to squeeze more profits while raising prices that are unrecognizable to Harvey's regulars.  

It's quite sad.  This was one of my favorite places in Phoenix - a wineburger and a game of pool - never crowded - that old dive charm...and hands down in the top 5 best burgers in town.  Apparently the new owner(s) believe all they need is a 40-year reputation.  Good luck with that, I won't be back."
1,"Seriously Danny's. I just left, you washed my car just fine but why in the world can you not open the back hatch and vacuum!  This is the second time it's happened. Shame on me for going back. I will be calling management to complain as well. This is crazy that you have to inspect everything before you leave. 
I'd rather go to Francis and Sons on 7th St even though it takes twice as long. As least I know everything will be cleaned"
1,"Came here because Cooperstown was closed. Got a seat quick, sat for 20 minutes and not 1 damn waitress, with 2 or 3 walking around, came to our table. We just got up and left. For a place supposedly owned by a former Phoenix Sun, it lacks to impress... would rate it no stars if I could."
5,"Ci!

Comedor Guadalajara is a place that seems to always come up when discussing Phoenix Mexican food.  I finally found myself in the area and dropped by for early lunch and was not disappointed.

To the tourists and over cautious it may not look like the best area to be but have no worries.  This part of town is just old and run down.  You won't be knifed in the parking lot and there's even a security guard keeping an eye on the lot.  Have no fears.

As per usual when I hit a Mexican place I ordered the enchilada's.  The appetizer was the standard free house chips and salsa.  Oh, boy!  The salsa!  I always complain that the salsa in not hot enough (even at Mexican places) but one bite here and there was a temporary spice assault upon my eyes and nose.  Both started to run and I loved every minute.  When your body reacts, you know you're eating good salsa.  My Pepsi came soon after wards and it was the largest drink I've ever been served save for a liter of beer I had at a German tavern in New York City.

My food arrived soon after wards and it was served on a scorching hot plate.  Everything was delicious and I think they make their own refried beans.  Possibly the best beans I've had at a Mexican place.

The dining area is larger than a fast food joint but smaller than your typical restaurant.  Not long after I arrived it started to fill up quickly.  Expect to wait a few minutes at peak times.

Sadly this structure was an impenetrable fortress for my phone and I was unable to officially do a Yelp check in but, eh, I cannot hold that against the Comedor.

I'd like to note that quite a few of the patrons were Hispanic and that, to me, is always a good sign when eating at a Mexican joint.

I have been waiting to find a Mexican restaurant that I can officially dub as the best I've had.  I am confident I can dub thee, Comedor Guadalajara, as the best I have had.  Can't wait to take any visitors I have here."
1,"Went to Macayo's on Central last night for dinner. HUGE mistake. We sat in the dining area and our waiter asked us our drinks (pink lemonade and raspberry iced tea) and then we get chips and salsa with watered down salsa  then the waiter comes about 10 mins later brings drinks (sprite/almost clear watered down raspberry iced tea) then he was helping the table next to us so after I call him and he kept on walking (maybe he didn't hear me) until the second time he came back and I got his attention then I order a coke instead and he takes our order. I ordered the mini chimies. 15 mins later I was greeted with dark brown on a plate and looked like they were fried in 10 day old dirty cooking oil or even possibly ""refried"" (wouldn't surprise me with all the watered down stuff) so because i had other stuff to do I decided not to complain and attempt to eat what they had given me and there are 6 which I ate 3 and I was tapped out on burnt grease...so he gives ME the bill which he watches me pull out my card and pay but when he comes back he hands my card and receipt to my guest.

Well I thought last night was a mistake but it didn't end there. Today I STILL have an after taste of grease. I have tried drinking a bubbly soda and chewing gum, popped an anti-acid and nothing...I literally had to leave work early and now laying here in my bed feeling nautious  as hell and staying close to a toilet as I write this review."
1,"Today, I had a terrible experience at Monona's Village Pedaler. i arrived at 10am as the shop opened. I needed to simply pump up a tire on my nephew's bike. I had trouble getting to the air value due to a spoke that was a little to snug to the value. Very simple issue....

I walked in and there was a white lady getting her bike fixed. Another white lady and a white gentleman came in after me. 

The first lady bike was serviced. I was clearly next. The guy working there looked past me and serviced the white lady before me! It was clear that I was next, but he didn't serve me. 

I patiently waiting thinking something was strange. He then asked me what I needed. I explained and we walked to the pump. He started to pump the air into the value, stopped 1/2 way through, and went to help the white gentleman. He just left me standing there. ??????

He got a set of tires for the man and left me wondering what I had done. I walked back in the shop wondering what was going on. I stood next to the gentleman. As the worker charged the man's credit card in the front of the store, the customer looked at me and apologized for the man working. He thanked me for my patience and went along. 

Again, we went to the pump and the worker finished pumping up the front tire. I proceeded to ask him if he would squeeze the back tire to see if it needed air too. He refused to do it, telling me that I 'should know how to do it.' He told me that 'this is a simply life skill that I should already know how to do'. Huh? 

I said, 'In your professional opinion, would you suggest that I add more air to the tire?'. He replied with a short, crisp, snotty attitude, ""you feel the front tire and it (the back tire) needs air, do it"". Wow!!!!!

...and he walked back in the store, leaving me by myself. 

I'm serious, I stood there shocked and wondering what was happening.

I am an African American professional who wanted to take my nephew on his first Monona-lake bike ride. I didn't deserve service like this. 

If you don't support discriminatory business, stay away from this shop! He didn't need to treat me with such disregard. They don't deserve your money. Stay away and tell your friends to not support this shop."
5,"The first thing I think about when I think about Fraboni's is the smell when you first open up the door.  It is totally delicious, and you really can't put your finger on exactly what it is.  I assume it's a combination of the cooking porkettas and meatballs, the various spices they sell, and pizza sauce.  Whatever the smell is, I wish I could order a plateful of it!  

If I am going into Fraboni's, you know I'm not coming out empty handed."
5,"Lately, I've been very fortunate to visit little gems that Yelpers love!  This my friend's, is one of the gems.

Bar Bianco is quaint, cool, hip, suave, and authentic.  We had just left a charity event at Alice Cooperstown, it was Friday night, there was a Sun's game ending and we decided on Bianco to have 1 last drink.  Chuck was tending the small bar and accommodated our group of 6 perfectly.  Ordered a couple of cheese plates, a drink and proceeded to converse with our bar mates.

From what I've read on other reviews, people wait 3 hours for a table next door at Pizzeria Bianco, while sipping libations here.  Seriously?  Wait 3 hours for Pizza?  Yep.  Thankfully, the dinner crowd had dispersed and Bar Bianco was not packed and service was excellent.  I will definitely be back soon."
1,"It was a terrible experience in every possible way. The wait time in the drive thru lane was excessive, the order was incorrect, and the chicken was slimy and smelled like it was rotting. I haven't eaten McDonald in over a year before trying it again and I found it to be just as disgusting as the last time."
5,"Only been there once and been wanting go back again soon. We used to go to that side of town once a month and I would wonder about this place with my husband's name. So one day, stopped there to see if they have anything quick to eat. Fresh sandwiches were great....made the way we wanted. The place was clean and very friendly. Too bad,found it after I no longer live on that side of town."
5,"I took my wedding dress to Darlene for alterations and she did a terrific job. She was very up front about what the dress needed and what she could do (she added boning, cups, took in the waist, and took up a very complicated hem). She was also very communicative about the entire process, which helped to calm my nerves about the work. Her prices are reasonable and she worked quickly and within my timeline. The results were beautiful. I can't recommend her enough and I'll definitely be taking things there in the future."
5,"great average $40 wigs.


I wore it to ""big party""."
1,"Don't buy deals for this business. Bought a living social for 4 blow drys. I have called 5 times to make appointments and they have been ""booked"" every time, even when I call with multiple weeks notice. I'm getting a refund and going to dry bar instead. Whoever answers the phone here is pretty rude, as well."
5,"This place makes me wish it was mine! The best home made biscuits, juicy off the bone fried chicken, great collard greens, and amazing catfish po boy."
1,"So now I know my worth to Ace.   

I have always used this store as a super convenient Hardware store...,NEVER AGAIN!!!  I was returning air condition filters for a different size ... Simple right--- WRONG.   This exchange was not in their policy so they could not do it.  Sometimes a business manager needs to look past a store policy to retain a great client.  The filters probably cost them 2 bucks: compared to the hundreds of dollars that I have spent and  the hundreds that I would have spent in the future... I am glad to know that your appreciation of local clients is not worth 2 bucks.... ACE I am disappointed in you."
5,"wasn't sure what to expect, but the food was EXCELLENT.  personal service from the husband & wife owners make you feel right at home.  the tabouleh and hommos definitely rival anyplace i've ever tried.  they actually make the tabouleh to order!!!  incredibly fresh and delicious.  delicious baklava!  and, although i didn't try any, the donuts also looked amazing.  might have to stop back and pick up a dozen, for the road."
1,"I was excited to get a group of 5 great friends together for a light brunch and several rounds of bloody Mary's. My excitement did not last long. The bloody Mary was so bland, it tasted like plain tomato juice with black pepper... However, this was not the worst part, that was they way my crepe tasted. I'm a lover of crepes. I learned how to make them as a child and they're my Go-To brunch indulgence. Now when you eat something that you love and you're confidant that you have healthy taste buds, you get very disappointed when your food tastes bad. Where I was hoping to find a delicious nutella and banana flavor, I was taken aback by the overwhelming taste of oil. Not delicious. 

Chefs can have an off day and food can turn, I get it. I don't get how a Server can then attempt to make a customer feel guilty or stupid if they send the plate back. I've worked in the service industry for many years and sending food back, gives the restaurant a chance to turn your experience around. If you messed up once, it's totally forgivable, however if you then give a crappy response to the customer, you're officially a sucky server. 

Bummed that I had such a poor experience at this cute little neighborhood eatery and even more bummed that I didn't get to enjoy a tasty crepe. 

Crepe-lessly yours,

Joan"
1,"Waitstaff suck... Unless you have testicles. I love Hooters wings, I won't be back to this Hooters."
5,"This place is DEFINITELY NOT CLOSED. I loved it when Sloane Mcfarland was cooking there after getting it back to [almost] original condition and was ecstatic to find out this weekend that it's now a pop up restaurant.

Thank you Marshall Shore for letting us know about this place!  We were a party of nine for Easter dinner last night - we filled the diner itself and ordered 1 of everything on the menu [2 of certain items].  There were 10 dinner items and 4 dessert items.  We passed the dishes down the counter to each other.

The menu is strictly vegetarian, but Payton keeps a few meat items available for hard core meaties - like my daughter and I who shared a heavenly fettuccine bolognese.

Each dish was superb.  I have a really hard time deciding on a favorite, but I think I'll go with the Fava and Steuben beans served in agave nectar with a walnut pesto.  My wife and daughter are going with the Beluga lentils, parsley and celery leaf.

We had a tasting menu [no pairing] I would have been happy to pay $75 for and we got away with $20.

Unbelievable."
5,Best green chicken enchiladas I've ever had in my life!! The side of guacamole can get a bit pricey but it better be award winning because the flavor is unmatched by any other guacamole I've tasted. Have a mango margarita with a chile rim to go with your meal and basque in some if the finest Mexican food this state can offer!
1,Food was ok. Service was poor. Saw a roach near our table. Not my choice for a lunch companion!
1,"Hi there!  I'll be right with you!  That's what you should say, any of the 10 times you walk right past the customer who is clearly and patiently waiting.  Not avoid eye contact and say nothing.  Then, when you finally have time,  let the customer finish talking before you stomp off to get what you think they need.  What is with the elitist attitude of bike shop dudes around here?  You're a bike mechanic...not an astronaut who cured cancer while drinking and say the alphabet backwards."
5,This place deserves more than 5 stars. This is how homemade Mexican food is suppose to taste like. My mom told me about this place and ever since then we go there every time there's a special occasion. We would go every weekend if this place was a lil closer than home. I always order their shredded beef enchilada plate that includes bean and rice. Absolutely amazing. The sauce was the perfect hint of spicy to it. The meat was fresh as well. Bean and rice is my favorite. Also! This place has a great price for how much food you get. It's delicious and I will recommend anyone there for Mexican food. Love it!
1,"I just left this Walgreens where the pharmacist on duty discriminated against me and publicly humiliated me. 

This is what happened. I'll try to be as detailed as possible, as this review may be used in court one day. First, let me say I have a chronic condition and I am a polite and easy-to-get-along-with ""regular"" of this pharmacy. I've never had an issue before tonight. Efran, who I normally deal with in the pharmacy, is a great guy- super friendly and always smiling. Monica, the manager, was very responsive and polite when I called her tonight. Hopefully, she will resolve the pharmacist's problem.

However:

I badly injured my finger and it became infected. It is swollen to triple size and a doctor had to slice it open today to drain the puss. The doctor used zero anesthetic, but he had good reason. That's another story.

So he gave me a prescription for 15 Vicodin and 20 antibiotics. I wasn't picking up 200 Oxycontin tablets or doing anything weird. It was a small amount of pain pills and antibiotics to match. My injury was also very visible on my right hand.

I was asked for ID, which is understandable, because I was picking up a regulated narcotic. I get that.

So I hand the pharmacist a government issued photo ID. The government ID had a matching address to my prescription. In addition to that, I had an ASU student ID, a credit card (that I was paying for the prescriptions with), and my insurance card ...and I also had a visible injury. A visibly infected injury on my hand, and I was picking up the exact prescription that would match the physical evidence.

What I'm trying to say is that it was crystal clear that I was who I claimed to be.

However, the photo ID that I showed was unique. Only certain people get to carry it. I am not saying my ID was a green card (and I'm not saying it wasn't), but a green card would be an example of a government photo ID that is not commonly shown.

But if you are visiting from a foreign country, for example, and you are here legally, you should be able to get prescriptions that you need. I know that Arizonans aren't fond of illegal aliens, but people that are here legally should be able to get medication if they are sick.

Not at this Walgreens. The pharmacist declared, in front of witnesses, that they won't serve everyone. If you are visiting this country, go elsewhere. The pharmacist at this Walgreens will not help you.

Upon inspecting my government issued, legal photo ID (that the bank accepts by the way), the pharmacist said, ""I'll take it this time, but next time, you'll need an ID from the DMV.""

From the DMV! Can you believe it? She actually said ""from the DMV."" 

I said: ""That's a legal government-issued photo ID. You can't deny me.""

She then arrogantly proclaimed: ""I am the pharmacist and that is our policy! We need an ID from the DMV!""

I protested, because, since I don't drive, just going to the DMV is a tremendous pain in the butt. And what law says that you need DMV ID? Who says that you are required to visit the DMV ever? As far as I know, you just need to be able to prove that you are here legally. My ID proved I was here legally. And again, it was government issued photo ID.

Upon me protesting, she snatched my prescriptions from the cashier (all on videotape) and said, ""Then I won't give them to you if you want to argue!""

Okay, so this girl has a power-struggle issue. I get it. 

I'm in agony, and I know when I am dealing with a nut-job, so I satisfied her narcissism and agreed that yes, she was the pharmacist and no, my ID wasn't good enough. And she handed me my prescriptions. Thank God. You see, it was never about the ID. Otherwise, I wouldn't have my Vicodin right now. It was about exerting control over a customer. A regular customer that has spent over a thousand dollars in that store, in 2012.

She actually held pain medication over my head, until I agreed to her illegal, discriminatory policy.

So, in a state of duress, desperate, I relented. I said, ""Okay. I agree."" (clenching my teeth in agony)

As I was walking out, I turned to her and said, ""I am now going to write a review online.""

She replied: ""Good! Go ahead. And now we will never serve you again."" She went over to the computer and publicly announced that she will make a note on my account and that I can't get prescriptions from there anymore. Again, humiliating me in public.

And what did I do? Absolutely nothing. I did nothing wrong. I never even swore or called her a bad name. All on videotape.

I am contacting an attorney first thing Monday morning. Good luck Walgreens."
1,"Is it possible to give ""zero"" stars?

I've been in there twice and the employees were rude, both times.  I'm not the ""Scottsdale Elite"", but seriously... I'm a paying customer too.  The little boy who said he was the manager was rude too."
5,"i love grocery stores.  a decent place to shop for food is the mark of a town's liveability.  (believe me, i know--i lived in florida with nowhere to shop but publix.)  upon settling in the jenny spaight area, the search for groceries began.
 i have two rules:  i want to shop in my neighborhood--preferably locally owned, and i want to be able to do 90% of my food/beer buying in one place.  now certainly, being the good isthmus dweller that i am, i cherish the co-op.  problem is, i have a serious diet coke addiction, as well as a lust for some other salty, fat-laden goodies, which means that the co-op doesn't satisfy rule number 2.  
then, i discover jenny street market.  it is love at first sight.  a small, locally owned grocery store full of friendly faces and nifty food finds.  what more could i want?  decent array of produce? check. fine selection of cheeses?  it's wisconsin.  fage yogurts?  um-huh.  more ice cream than you can shake a stick at?  got it.  fancy crackers (i am a sucker)?  yep.  a walk-in beer cooler, complete with jackets for comfort? oh yeah.  nonni's biscotti?  yes ma'am.  and of course, diet cokes.
i love the neighborhood grocery.  makes me feel at home.  prices are a bit higher (so i hear) than woodmans (never been) or some of the other bigger stores, but i feel good supporting local markets.  selection may not be as vast as the biggies, but the bottom line is if i can't find it at jenny's, i don't need it."
5,"I have been coming here for years. And the service is consistently friendly; servers remember me and always have a smile. I love their new menu items: tonight I tried their Turtle Crab appetizer, which was very refreshing with fresh crabmeat and avocado. You must have their dragon eggz crispy...very tasty. I have yet to try their new entrees, but I will certainly be back again soon. Their Holy Basil chicken dish is hands downs the best, and at the best price. This restaurant is the best value in town and I have tried other Thai restaurants. All you need to see is their dedicated chef in their open kitchen to understand why this place rules!"
1,"Like their competitor Sprinkles, Tammie Coe is just way to sweet for me. Their frosting is heavier and their is just something in their cupcakes that makes me wonder what is that? As much as my coworkers enjoy both Tammie Coe and Sprinkles, I pass everytime someone brings them in as I am just not a fan. For those that enjoy them, by all means I am not mad at ya. Just don't understand what all the fuss is about."
5,"Some part of me recognizes that the Village Green might be a bit of a hole in the wall, but I've been going there since before I could walk so I have to love it.  It's where ""the locals"" go for a burger and cheese curds.  Whether you graduated from MHS in 2004 or in 1969, you'll probably run into someone you know from high school.

I love this place because it hasn't changed a bit - the food is still awesome, they still don't take credit cards, and they still play nothing but football on the big screen tv up front."
1,"I've spending a lot of time with a friend who is a pretty serious coffee drinker.  A couple nights ago, we stopped in at Hava Java for a caffeinated beverage before enjoying some gelato next door.  Being the afternoon of July 4th, the place was empty, save for the barista and a guy who was in there chatting her up.  I ordered a cafe au lait, he an iced coffee of some sort.  After asking me if I preferred skim milk or 2%, the barista handed me my cup of milk and foam and told me the coffee was self-serve and pointed me in the direction of the three coffee dispensers on the other side of the bar.  Really?  $3.75 for a cafe au lait and I have to pour the coffee myself?  I suppose that wouldn't have been entirely terrible if it had been any good.  It's amazing how much difference whole milk makes, but even beyond that, the coffee was weak and flavorless, and since it had to be pumped over the weak foam and milk, my drink tasted like little more than a drip coffee with milk.  Lame.  Sorry, Hava Java - a repeat customer I will not become.

P.S. - A $0.25 ""service fee"" is charged to all credit/debit transactions.  Again, lame."
5,I absolutely love the staff at AllPets. They do an extraordinary job of taking care of my dog. I am impressed by their knowledge as well as their patience and clarity in explaining care options.
1,Ew. Each bite was pure fatty nastiness.
1,Slow. Wrong order and didn't ask if i wanted cream and sugar. Saw one guy walking around aimlessly looking at the register. Wont be coming back.
1,"I don't normally order Domino's, but when I do, it's because I'm feeling extra lazy.  I ordered online, and got 10 of the 14 wings I ordered; I asked for them to be well done (which means send half way through the oven again), but they were squishy and boxed up before my 2nd pizza came out of the oven.  Pizzas weren't ""hot"", they were barely warm, which means the oven temp wasn't correct.  I ordered regular cheese and there was more red sauce than cheese (which means they're short on cheese for the week).  I live 2 blocks from here, but will gladly drive right past it to go somewhere else.  You can redecorate the lobby all you want, it's just lipstick on a dead pig.

They used to care and send you a survey after you ordered online, now there isn't any option to send feedback.

You guessed it, I used to work at Domino's, so I know how this works.  Ever since Mittens bought the franchise they've gone to sh*t."
1,"This location is terrible. They did nothing but screw up multiple cars of mine. Now it's two years later, and the compressor they broke and replaced is broken again. 

DO NOT GO THERE!"
5,"If you are a fan of the old tried and true meal of teriyaki chicken bowls, you will absolutely love this family own restaurant. Even though the food is spectacular, the thing that always stands out the most about The Blue Fin is the unbelievable customer service. I cannot think of a time I have been here where the owner was not behind the counter giving me her heart-felt thanks for being a customer. 

The place may not look like much from the outside but just know that you will be taken care of once you are there and will have some incredible food for dine in or take out."
5,"Well, I'm a little biased being that I'm one of the members here; but seriously Eye Lounge exhibits some of the better up and coming artists in town.  A little plug for myself, come see my show there in November (it's in the west gallery Omer!)  If any of you want a card, email me your address and I will send one right out to ya!"
1,"In our house this store is known as ""Ghetto Target"". My wife and I feel subservient to this store for geographic purposes. We have come to know and, ultimately, endure our frequent shopping trips with continually lowered expectations of anything positive coming our way. The checkout staff is, to a person, rude, unprofessional and often seem just really, really dumb. 

My favorite story from Ghetto Target is a few months ago when I purchased some laundry detergent, paper towels and a birthday card. Upon my exit , a security guard followed me out of the store and asked to see my receipt for the purchase. Surprised, I replied kindly, ""no you can't but thanks for asking"". I kept walking to my car as the security guard ""ordered"" me to stop, threatening to call police. I calmly told him I was okay with his plan to call the cops, got in my car and drove away with him standing in my rear view mirror, looking like a complete idiot. 

Of course, it's Target, so I still go back. Often. Maybe I'll  get a t-shirt that reads ""I survived Ghetto Target""."
1,Don't even bother. This place is a ghost town with less than bright servers.
5,"As someone who LOVES Thai food, I can really appreciate a good Pad Thai, and Wild Thaiger's is my favorite hands down!

Just like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors, to the point where every bite is unique.  If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.

Their other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.

Their Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.

The service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.

One day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet, but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place.  Highly recommended!"
5,"Professional, friendly and fast. Very customer oriented. I was running late, and they kept the doors open for me top pick up my order after hours. I will use them again and again."
1,"Been their once and would never return.  First it is not a buffet.  It should be named ""Pancho's Mexican Kitchen Line.""  This place makes Taco Bell seem gourmet!  Everything is low grade and perpetuates the stereotype that Mexican food is of low quality.  I am Mexican-American and used to changing peoples view of Mexican food because I am a good cook.  But this has to be of the lowest quality I have come across.  All the Filibertos, Ramiros and Armando's are extremely better than this place."
5,Rachel is the best ever and I love staying here.  It is on my company but they are worth every dime.  The breakfast was wonderful everyday and the shuttle service is always on time.  The drivers are so awesome and they love taking care of us.  It is always wonderful to get great customer service and this place sets the bar.
5,"I love the Ranch Market!  The atmosphere is great, the produce prices are very reasonable, and the civiche is excellent! I never go down the center isles, as they appear to be filled with typical grocery store packaged foods  What makes Ranch Market special are the fantastic offerings all around the center isles.  

Here is my advice:  First, make your way to the fresca bar to get a fresh fruit drink, it's just past the bakery at the front door.  After you pick up your favorite fruit drink head over to the grill for some carne asada street tacos, but only order two because you'll want to save room for the seafood bar where you will find a deliciouso shrimp ceviche at a very reasonably price.  I usually order a half pound of the regular shrimp civiche and a half pound of the civiche ensalda; eat a little at the bar on a tostada and take the rest home for lunch the next day.  Yummy!  After you have filled your belly with the tasty carne asada and civiche, stop by the tortilla factory to get some fresh tortillas to go and don't forget to hit up the bakery for hot cream filled churro for desert."
1,"I'm 20 years old.  The last exam I had was when I was 17-18 at planned parenthood.  When you go into their offices for birth control they basically make you do an exam when you go in.  Well, I needed a new gynecologist and my boyfriend's mom recommended Central Phoenix OB/Gyn.  Since I hadn't gone to a professional before (besides planned parenthood) I thought I would give it a try.  The receptionist is VERY rude.  When we first got there we had to stand at the counter for 15 mins before she came out to give me my paperwork.  Her attitude isn't very welcoming, which is what pushed me away in the beginning.  First impressions are very important.  I had set an appointment with the Doctor, but come to find out that she wasn't in the office and they would have to schedule it with the NP (Nurse Practitioner).  I didn't get an exam like I was told, but she consulted me on my birth control and they took a STD test just so I could feel certain that I didn't have any.  They gave me a small discount for not being able to see the doctor ($185 Without insurance) and told me that they would contact me with the results from my test on Monday (a week from when I went).  Monday came and I got no calls.  I had another appointment scheduled not too far from then, so I decided to wait until I went back to the office.

The second visit I was scheduled with a doctor (that I did see that time) and was greeted by the oh so friendly receptionist.  I was told that they didn't have my test results (They LOST them) and that I would have to do another and they would take care of it.  They DIDN'T do any exam (AGAIN!) even though I was scheduled for it (I haven't had an exam for about 3 years now).  She just consulted me on the birth control and sent me on my way.  I had many questions, I have been having a lot of pain in my lower abdomen which is why I needed to be checked, and she just seemed to be rushing through all of them with no care.  I told her I was frequently urinating and I haven't been drinking a lot of water.  Her solution was that I was drinking a lot of water (I thought I just told her I didn't drink a lot) and that everything was fine.  I was a little frustrated, but that's fine.  I got to the front desk and I had to pay $250 for a consultation and no exam!  They called me a week later and I assumed it was for my results... NOPE.  They had ""forgotten"" to charge me, even though they told me since they screwed up the first time they would take care of it, and I had to pay another $250 for the lab!  That's ridiculous.

There are too many mistakes in this office for anyone to just overpass.
I don't know if it's because I didn't have insurance, but they made me feel very unwelcome and like I couldn't afford anything in the office.

Planned Parenthood seems a lot more professional and welcoming... At least they give me an exam every time I go."
1,"Bag was stolen by a store employee while I sat and listened to my iPad eating lunch. Caught on video, store manager and owner covering up the situation. Police are now involved and detective investigating the video. Store employee never reported anything to a manager and cleaned out my bag in a cleaning closet in the store. 

Homeless use this location as a sanitation station. Be prepared to be asked several times for money. 

Homeless change clothes right in the store."
1,"I have been to this restaurant three times for lunch while at work, and I must say that the first time I was there, the service was slow and the food mediocre.  The last two times I went there, it was not by my choice but by group consensus.  The food is also mediocre at best, having a friend whose mother is from El Salvador, this food was terrible, absolutely terrible in comparison.  The beans and cheese and pork inside my pupusa had the consistency of water, and the hot sauce seemed like it was 3 parts water, 1 part hot sauce.  Each time I went there I called ahead and placed my order, and I had to wait at least 15 minutes for my drink and at a minimum of 30 - 45 min. to wait for my food (after ordering ahead!!).  I brought this up with the family that owns the restaurant, and they told me, in their exact words, it's not their problem, and if I had brought more people then we would have had better service and they don't need to worry about one customer because they have been there for so long if they lose one customer, they have many more waiting.  I don't understand how a place with one or two waitresses can even expect to adequately service their customers correctly.  I have been overcharged and never received items that I have ordered that were still on my check and I had to argue with the owner.  It is by far the worst service I have ever received in this city.  About 5 people I work with have all sworn to never return to this store."
5,"I have purchased several items from Mike and Gary over the years to include hockey gear, Oakley's, baseball gear, and now as of recent; Bikes. I used to be heavily involved in bike racing about 20 years ago, but becuase of the sport changing so much to this date, I once again went to the Village Peddler to ask the experienced and knowledgeable staff at VP. Having two boys changing from BMX style to Mountain bikes, I had no idea what to look for size wise. Gary showed both boys the different bikes and took the time to explain the differences. When each of them picked out the style of bike that they liked the most, Gary measured each of them and suggested the correct size knowing that they will need room to grow. In comparing two other bikes stores, their sale prices were still more than Village Peddler everday prices, can you say mark-up!

Each of the boys were taught how to assemble and dissasemble their tires making sure to check the brakes to allow them for a seamless ride.Gary went over this a couple times to make sure the boys were comfortable to do it on there own, then asked them both to do it by themselves. After about two times, they are pros! I was impressed as I sat back and watched the interaction between the boys, Gary, and newly joining in on the conversation; Mike. It was impressive to see that both of the boys fealt comfortable and were totally ingaged with Gary and Mike like they had known them for years. It was obvious that both the men have kids and could relate specifically on a personal level before professional. Both Gary and Mike spent about 25 minutes with them, which in this day and age doesn't happen in the big corporate run stores. I have been in customer service myself for over 20 years, so it definitely takes a lot to impress me! 

I have visited other bike stores where we were just treated like a number, when finally asked if we needed help it was if the clerk was being timed to make sure he could get back to the next person in line. When I am considering spending a large amount of money, if I am not impressed with your customer service, you have definitely lost the sale. In this case, we as a family were treated excellent, and coming from a guy in his 40's, I don't find many places that are willing to make a good personal experience great, but in the case it most definitely was. 

We added several accessories to our purchase and all together spent far less than we would have elsewhere. Once we were done, both guys wheeled the bikes out and helped us secure them in the truck conveinently out a side door of their shop. While in the store, I picked out a couple of bikes that I am intersted in, and soon as have time, you can bet that I am going to head back and buy the one that makes the most sense. When I have a good experince shopping, I tend to tell everyone I know, and this time will be no different. Thanks for a pleasent experience guys, I really appreciate it!

1,Was there 11/27 with a groupon. Ordered the Philly Cheese Steak. It was unremarkable. The meat was salty and tasteless. The cheese ended up adhered to the paper wrap. A good cook knowing his business would be aware of this issue. The bread was average. If it was not for the groupon they would have gotten the sandwhch back. I took most of it home and fed it to my dogs. In the world of food its real hard to screw things up when others do it right. For this reason I give it two thumbs down and a no to return dining.
1,"AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!food is awful, place smells.  Would not recommend this place at all.
Food is made with this lime juice and all food is covered with onions, and the black beans and rice is GROSS."
5,This place is awesome when you want good food and dont have much time. When I am in a pinch I will order the falafel to go. It is filling and yummy!  I have also had the gyro and side salad on previous visits. Highly recommended!!
1,"Staying as airline crew at the Sheraton hotel across the street, I asked the front desk person to recommend me a good Mexican restaurant.  He recommended the ""Canyon Café"" which is in the same exact mall/movie complex as this place, ""Mi Amigo's "" .  I reviewed the Canyon Café's menu and didn't care for it since it's more of a Fusion restaurant, not real Mexican food.  I told the hostess that I wanted more authentic food and she told me to try ""Mi Amigo's"" . I walked 100 feet to this place.  I have to say the server was a sweetheart...very friendly, welcoming - THAT's the ONLY thing I liked about this place, aside from the Cadillac Margarita for $5.75.  I ordered the tortilla soup.  OKish; free chips and salsa - the chips were awesome, the salsa mediocre.  The worst disappointment was my main course - I ordered the Red Beef Tamales.  These are the worst tamales that I remember eating.  I can make them better myself at home!! And I am an awful cook!  I was joined by one of our flight attendants and he joined me at my table.  He pretty much reached the same concensus as I.  Sorry, but I really, really was looking forward to a nice, hot tasty Mexican meal.  I was in Arizona for crying out loud, not in North Dakota or Maine, where Mexican food may not be as widespread.   PLEASE get your menu and most importantly your ingredients in order!  My colleagues at my airline stay across the street at the Sheraton and would appreciate a nice Mexican meal on our work trips.   Thanks !!"
1,"All I know is that this place smells like old tuna. The cheap kind. There's a bunch of old bald dudes giving me the eyeball at the bar, and the waitresses are less than stellar, even for a dive establishment. I don't care if it's inconsistent, but just be nice. I also question the projector screen that is twice as big as the actual picture. 

As for the drinks, there's a fine line between strong and just disproportionate. If you're mixing drinks, just follow basic principles. That's all I ask."
5,"$5 martinis and $5 manicures on Mondays!!!

The manicurist teaches at a school, so - needless to say - the manicure was great.

The drinks were good.  The bartender stayed on top of us, but also out of our way.  

The atmosphere is just lovely - chill/quiet - and the staff (including the perfectly charming (and handsome!) Owner) were really pleasant to be around.

I think Cheuvront may be losing some of its steam to the newer restaurants downtown and, granted, I've yet to try this out for dinner and wine, but it's really a very lovely place and I'd really like to see this neighborhood staple thrive!"
5,"Ah, Chicago Pizza! It's been four months and this was a slice of heaven. You people from Chicago know what I'm talking about. We ran into this by accident and we just had lunch, but we had to go in and order a pizza anyways. Yes, we ate the whole thing. The crust was a little different but I'm not complaining one bit. Loved it!"
1,"Used Charter for a couple of years. Just ditched them and I couldn't be happier. Shortly after we first started with Charter our connection went out, took them days to send someone out and it turned out they'd disconnected us for no reason at all. Thanks Charter. Fast forward to the recent past when our bill went up, I called up to try and get a new promotional rate because I'm no paying $60 for internet that bombs out briefly a couple times a day. They said they couldn't do anything better than their listed rate. 
After that I decided to downgrade to their lowest speed for the time being in order to save some money. When I called up to do so they transferred me to retentions and magically they offered me a better rate. Turned out they were lying and there was an additional charge on top of that because I wasn't bundling serviced (I have no interest in rotting my brain out watching cable TV or having a phone that I can't take with me in my pocket), when I complained and asked for the original rate the supervisor did not apologize and said the last person I talked to must have assumed I knew about the extra fee. When I told her I wanted the original rate she said there was nothing she could do, what is the point of having a retentions department if the best they can do is what is listed on the website?
Finally I organized DSL with AT&T which was simple and easy and did not require a visit for installation. I just plugged the DSL modem in and called customer service who guided me through the set up. When I called to cancel with Charter they offered me the original rate but I'm pretty sure it would have been the same thing again. After calling to disconnect I got several calls from Charter trying to get my business back if perhaps they offered me a really good rate but by that point they'd managed to blow whatever shred of credibility they had left in my mind. Since I don't trust their billing practices I had no interest in continuing business with them any longer and am now much happier for it!"
5,"The Herberger Theater in Phoenix is always the best for performances. This weekend, October 5th, they are also having a Festival of the Arts event where they will be having events inside and flowing out into the streets as well. It's from noon to 5pm and you will see Live Music, Food Vendors, Wine Tastings, Film Shorts,  Children's Activities and my favorite, Pet Adoptions.  I hope to see you all out there. This is the best way to experience the Herberger Theater for the first time if you have never been there before.

1,"Well let me tell up front:  We never got to eat.  We changed our table from a Two top to a three at 5:20pm on a Tuesday Night in the dead of summer and that put us into the 3+ hour-wait stratosphere of seating, so we left after two hours.

This is NOT sour Grapes because of that.  I said I was going to review the Bar and I am:  The Bar was terrible.  I despise a bartender who is so --whats the word?--spoiled, that she only has to serve whoever is standing in front of her, because business is so good.  

Any bartender wither their salt monitors the bar's comings and goings, keeps tabs on some rough order of service, and is rewarded with generous tips by seasoned diners who appreciate having their ""turn"" honored.  They didn't have one of those bartenders.  

The red wine Special they offered at $9.00 a glass had begun to turn, so that could be a reason they were pouring it off on the yokels, they had two tap beers--both bitter--and we had a $52 bar tab, which I know is nothing, but that's also what we got.

Let me tell you something All Yelpsters and Bar Owners of the World:  The Bartender is the Ambassador to your business.  That's all you need to know for training and service.  AMBASSADOR to your business.  Wake up, earn money.  

A good bartender could have cajoled us to stay."
1,"I'm giving one star and that's being generous considering the horrible service my coworkers and I just experienced, it was appalling! I have never dealt with such a rude person while trying to get simple take out! From the phone call placing our order to walking out, food in hand, every moment we felt like we were not welcome. I understand gathering four separate orders can be a pain but you're a restaurant, I can't imagine we were the first group with this request!  I'm not saying I will never eat here again because that is not the case but I can say I will never get take out for more then one person from here, what a mess!! VERY disappointed!"
5,"Monona Motors (and John...is it?) makes my '96 Geo Metro happy -  and has so for the past 8 years. They do great work, are incredibly honest, and always treat you like a valuable customer. You do pay for it - in the long run though, it is TOTALLY worth every cent."
5,This is my favorite Subway in town! I often go with my little boy and they are so friendly and patient while he practices ordering. The service is the best at his Subway and i will drive by several others just to go here for the awesome service!
1,"Local business caters to corporate cafeterias; unfortunately training is lacking and food prep is eek! Food has improper storage and easy attraction for varmints. Repetitive menus focus on carbs and starch, not flavor.  A soggy precooked breakfast burrito is hard to swallow in our awesome foodie city. 

Disappointing Turnover with grill chefs. There does not appear to be loyal followers here..."
5,"This place is as good as it gets for Mexican food in Arizona! I love the traditional feel of the restaurant (although not in the best neighborhood but not to worry they always have security on site to watch your cars while you eat lol) The food here is amazing, the past two times I have been there I have ordered the ground beef and potato tacos and the green chile stew, both are delicious. I have also tried the enchiladas and the albondigas soup which were also very tasty...If you enjoy Mexican food and are willing to drive to the area its definitely worth checking out!"
5,"So I checked around yelp for a new place to try for tacos and i came across Tacos De Jaurez. I was downtown so I decided to check it out with my sister.... I ordered the #5 carne asada soft tacos off the lunch menu and a large horchata ($5.99 and $1.99) and my sister order just one chicken soft taco............probably because I brought her to a place she's never been before, plus there were a few guys outside working on a vehicle and it sat in an open lot between two odd buildings... haha. So we got our food within 8 mins, not bad at all... she opened her bag and took one bite then scarffed the rest. I gave her a look as I was opening my food, as if to say your not touching mine because I had enough faith to order alot and i'm going to eat it all look.... It came with very delicious pico de gallo and red and green salsa. All three combined in my taco was awesome:).... full of flavor! The tacos came with rice and beans, both cooked perfectly... We didnt dine-in so i can't comment much about the service, but cashier lady was helpful and nice. 

So yeah I enjoyed it very much, although I didnt get to finish it all myself because I decided to share with my sister...yeah I know..snooze you loose, but I did.  I can tell she enjoyed the unexpected stop at Taco De Juarez, so we will be back:)"
5,"One of madison's best restaurants. Casual, come as you are atmosphere.  Best meatloaf and other comfort foods on the planet."
5,"We met another couple here for dinner.  Love the ambiance, the smell, the courtesy of the staff.  It's all good.  But the food was especially excellent.  I ordered the Pecan Catfish.  Wow!!!  It was baked to perfection with darkened spices making it the perfect spiciness!!!  I loved it!  Veggies were fresh and crisp.  We had an excellent Pinot Grigio off the list.  The others ordered tenderloin cordon bleu, which was raved about.  There was a shrimp and pork loins special.  That got thumbs up and then another shrimp dish that came on a bed of fresh spinach, which I think she wished she had rice or pasta instead, but she did like it.  Love coming here and always recommend it to friends!"
1,"We went here to pick out fabrics for a quilt. We used a few tables to pick out color schemes and see what we were working with. The worker walking by actually said to us, ""You ARE going to put that away, right?"" I was so apauled. Then when we went to get all the fabric cut the lady was also very unfriendly and just had poor customer service in general."
5,"Biscuits,  pbr tall boys, craft beers on draft... need I say more? I always end up here as an attempt to sober up after hitting up the bars off of Roosevelt. Long story short it never happens because they sell beer and I just end up getting extra wasted. But, it's okay! Their food is a great hangover cure, so I just come back the next morning and stuff myself with the best biscuits EVER. Hangover situation averted."
5,"I love it!  The Jerk chicken is fantastic, with authentic flavor.  The veggies are amazing, I love the spicey kick to them, personally I always get the potato salad cause I am not a fan of beans and rice but they usually are out of the potato salad, so I just get extra veggies!  The food is great."
5,Cannot find better BBQ.
5,This is the best place to watch theater in the Valley. No such thing as a bad seat. Acoustics are excellent. Small enough to feel intimate but big enough to not be confused with your neighbor's basement. I've enjoyed every performance I've seen here.
5,"Simply the best! I was there for the yelp event but could have spent the night I just couldnt get enough.

There is so much to explore and learn! I enjoyed laying on the bed of nails, and moving the ball with my mind. I have recommened this for people that live here and people from out of town on vacation.

Staff is incredably fun and happy to help and assist you.

I just cant say enough but , Ill simply say GO!!.. thats all I feel I can say wthout rambing about how amazing this place is."
5,I now know what you get when you pray to baby Jesus... these ribs. SO GOOD!!!!!!!
1,"Unless you have a few hours of your life you don't mind wasting, DO NOT COME HERE! 

My wife and a few friends decided to grab some happy hour food and beverages somewhere. when we arrived and sat down we asked about specials, the waiter replys with ""oh,  um.... $3 draft and wells"". we proceed to ask about food and margarita specials (that the sign behind us clearly states). he tells us ""no"". I then ask him ""Are you Sure? Because that sign over there says differently"". He then says ""i'll check"". 

I was right. 

strike 1..

After we order a drink we decided on some food. About 
15 minutes after we order a group of about 12 or 13 business type people walked in......Well i'm not really sure what happen after this point but everything seemed to go down hill really fast. 

Ok..... so i then ask the bartender to change the tv station from CBS News to the football game. (we are the only ones in there besides a person at the bar and the business types in the other room). He does this about 20 minutes after i asked as he obviously forgot until he saw me staring at him. Not too big of a deal.

25 minutes after ordering our appetizers we still have not seen our waiter or any sign of our food. He finally comes over to our table and says ""you're food will be out shortly, our cooks are slacking"" It's completely obvious to us that this guy forgot to put in our order. 

Finally our food arrives! It was brought out by another gentlemen who exclaimed ""Sorry about the wait folks, that big party over there (the business types) caught our cooks by suprise! 

1. We ordered long before they even came in. 
2. Your cooks got caught by surprise??!!!  So, they're not used to cooking when they go to work as a cook!

They got one order completely wrong. our friend who is a vegetarian, ordered the harvest sampler (the veggie sampler). They brought her the regular sampler consisting of beef chimi's burro's and other things. Now we have to wait another 20 minutes for her food. 

After comping her meal we received our check. We asked the waiter again if he can split it up 3 ways (we had told him we would be doing this prior to ordering) ""Sure, No problem he says"". He returns 10 mins later only to tell us he can't split the check and we'll have to ""figure it out"" 

 My wife and the rest of our party except one, proceed to leave and wait for us outside while we ""figure out"" the check.  After deciding we would leave a poor and undeserved tip just to be nice, our waiter brings back our change.. no $1's. before we can open our mouth to remedy this he is gone. 

At this point i'm tempted to walk out without leaving a tip but im a nice guy. So i stroll up to the bar to make change. The new bartender makes eye contact with me,  but doesn't say a word, turns around and proceeds to shuffle around the bar as he tries desperately to open a bottle of seagrams with no luck. After 5 minutes and not even a"" i'll be right with you"" or anything i walked out without leaving a tip. i have never done that before. EVER"
1,"If you've been to any Oregano's anywhere, you know what the food here is like. If you like the food, you like it. I find it much too salty and not really worth the long wait.

This particular joint is always busy to the point of overcrowding for lunch and dinner. Service is good and they have outdoor seating. Despite decent servers you will have a wait, either to sit down at all, or quite a wait for your pizza. Takeout is a good option. 

Parking is a problem because the restaurant doesn't have enough, so there is spillover into the local neighborhood. BE CAREFUL: People who have been drinking tend to drive out of there without even looking. Do not leave any valuables visible in your car, not even a CD. The area around 10th St and Camelback experiences a lot of smash and grab theft and even assault, so be aware of your surroundings. It's a good neighborhood, but buzzed, well-fed people are easy marks.

The negative review is because I think you can do a LOT better while supporting a locally owned place instead of a chain. And because I live in this neighborhood, and we have found Oregano's most unreceptive to working with the neighborhood residents to overcome parking and litter problems, and an increase in crime associated with these problems."
1,"I was helped right away in being seated, but it took forever for the food once seated.  The food was HORRIBLE and actually was sent back by my colleage.  I wanted to send mine back, but did not want to make it worse.  There were hardly any people in the restaurant, what took so long?  No wonder the taco was burnt.  But the black slimy stuff on the red pepper, what was that?!  Also, no specials at happy hour time (4:30 on a weekday).  Never again."
5,"Buying a new bike can be a big decision.  Buying a gimmicky electric bike could be a bad decision.  Buying electronics from a produce market could be questionable decision. And lastly buying anything over $500 from a place that is located south of downtown, cash only, and offers no warranties/returns... seems to put the nail in the coffin for logical decisions.  But some how myself and dozens of other logical people have had a excellent to OK experience when doing all of the above.

Phoenix Produce is selling Fujiton E-Bikes straight off the boat from China.  And we're not talking ""Made in China"" hidden in some innocuous spot; this is legitimately Chinese...from the oddly sized tires (which makes it a little difficult to find tubes for) to the Mandarin/Cantonese (not actually sure which) that fills the instrument panel and indicator lights.

Phoenix Produce carries two models 36v and 48v both have max speed of 20 MPH.  While they differ in range 22 miles and 30 miles, respectively, on a single charge.  The motor definitely has good torque for a little electric motor...I've heard the 48v is even better than my 36v.  Both plug directly into a 110V (normal) outlet.  The 36v costs a little more than 3 CENTS per charge. These are bikes, so you can ride them on sidewalks or other bike designated paths.  No license/registration/insurance/helmet required (legally per ARS 28-2516)...though the helmet is recommended.

As for the no warranties and returns part...I can only say what I've experienced.  Sam, the owner of Phoenix Produce, has been very good to me in all my dealings.  I had some initial problems with the battery and charger of the bike, making the first week of ownership less than stellar.  Fortunately, I talked to Sam about those issues and he corrected the problems no charge...sure seemed like a warranty; but Jenny, one of his employees, said ""He is just really fair.""  And I have to agree.  For the price you cannot beat them approximately $500 a little higher or lower depending on the model of your choice."
1,I would never go there again. I walked it there and the guy looked at me like I was bothering him. I guess my money will bother him too.
1,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Took my cat to get groomed with Mandy. She told me because there was a small knot in my cats hair that she would have to lion shave  my cars entire body! Obviously I said no and took my cat to petsmart where they brushed out the knots and returned my cat with a gorgeous coat... DON'T EVER TAKE YOUR CAT TO MANDY!
1,"Oh geeze I loathe this place. It smells like a sweaty swamp full of mold, yeast, day old balls and other unidentified bodily odors. The fluorescent lights blare while the instructors yawn and fan themselves with the list of asanas they repeat session after session ad nauseum. Did I mention it's also 100 degrees and 95 percent humidity in there? You will also huddle together as there is always a groupon bringing in the hordes. Don't worry, you will be able to see every inch of everyone's nearly naked body for only a few minutes as the mirrors quickly fog up with your collective sweat."
5,"I couldn't possibly think about standing around outside waiting for a table at Pizzeria Bianco. So why not make the best of it and come next door to Bar Bianco. 

A great wine list and an awesome selection of craft beers all reasonably priced! But the big allure for me is the old house that Bar Bianco is housed. Its just an amazing old house that has been lovingly cared for. All the details are still there and you can tell this place had a lot of love in it. The second you walk through the door the place has a just walked into grandma's house, make yourself at home kind of feel. 

You cant go wrong here.."
5,"The Jet Room is a must when in Madison. Watching planes take off and land while eating the best diner breakfast or lunch in Madison is a huge hit with adults and kids. If you go in the early morning you can also watch the Truax Fire Department Trucks circle the air field on their morning rounds. I'd highly recommend the Scramble for breakfast and the Wing Walker for lunch. I wish they were open past 2:00pm, but understand they are tailoring to a specific food type.

GO TO THE JET ROOM! That is all."
5,"i love their $6.99 pie sale and love that they are introducing new healthy salad options.

their prime rib is not bad!"
5,"It's a lovely store, with high quality products, and reasonable prices for what you get. I wouldn't go there for my weekly shopping, as it is a bit spendy, but once I have my staples, I will go there for different ingredients I can't get elsewhere, sustainable fish, great baked goods, stellar produce, high quality meats. If I want something special, they're one of the first places I go to.

Their policy of highlighting local goods is fantastic. There are little yellow signs in every aisle to point out products made within 150 miles or so, each sign showing where the product was made and how far way it is.  When given a choice between a few products, if I know something supports my community, I will favor it.

It's a very relaxing atmosphere to shop, too. I normally hate food shopping, but it is a pleasant experience, and I feel better when I am in there.

That all goes away, though, in the parking lot, which is too small, and too crowded. I plan my trips for the middle of the day in the hopes to avoid too many people. It is the only bad part about shopping there."
1,"What happened to this place. I have not been here like a year, and everything went down the hill. No more banana bread

First, Bad Service. We stood up for 5 minutes in front of main door while inside was not crowded. Waiter did not bring us a bread. i had to ask twice. Order was slow. I saw our food waited in the counter at least 10 minutes. I was ready to go and pick it up.

Sushi quality was bad. Yakisoba noodle was burned.

Well, I used to go this place alot, but I will never go back again. What happened to Japanese culture - Being fast , efficent and respectful ?

I will never come back, there are lots of nice places in nort phoenix. just go check it out like Tokyo lobby, yen sushi. It will worth a drive, and 

SAYANORA Cherry Blossom"
5,Best chinese I've found so far. Hot and sour soup and their won ton soup are fantastic. Sometimes I'll go and just get the soup.
1,"I was a Honey Bears fan for 20 years.  No more.  Will never visit again.

Stopped off at the Central Ave. location after a Sunday D'bax game.  Not that crowded.  Ordered, paid, and waited.  And waited.  Noticed most other customers were waiting too.  They finally brought out an order - #131 - I had #143.  Another 10 minutes before #132 came out.  People started coming up to the counter wondering what was going on.  The cashier was dismissive - no explanation, no apology, nothing.

50 (50!) minutes later my order finally arrived.  I didn't bother to complain knowing YELP is my best revenge.

Maybe there was a managment change, but Honey Bears will never see me again."
1,"They just phone it in.  On top of that, they bother the heck out of you to spend more money there, and then they take so long to finish that you're in too big of a hurry to notice just what a lousy job they have actually done.

This review is especially for their Scottsdale location at Shea/Scottsdale Road, but it really applies to all of their locations as I have used many of them over the years.

I lived in the Phoenix Area for more than 40 years before my current job took me to Southern California.  During that time I drove vintage cars and always wanted them to be looking nice.  In the mid-nineties, the car wash that I had frequented 2-3 times per week for years changed hands and the quality just fell apart.  I had noticed Danny's all over town, and decided to give them a try.

They were spectacular in those early years.  I got great service, everyone was friendly, and you didn't have those annoying ""how about a detail, oil change, upgrade to first class"" upselling as you drove up.  You chose, you paid, you hung out in a nice place while they really cleaned your car up nice.

Then somebody got greedy...  At first, there was this attack of the upsell elves coming up to your car and asking you if you wanted to buy more stuff, sometimes two-to-three times.  I fended them off at first, but they became so persistent that I complained, and well, I got a bewildered ""it's our right to make money"" attitude from them, so I basically started looking elsewhere and just used them when I was desperate.

Cut to the present.  I came back this last weekend to visit family, and my volvo wagon was a mess.  Kid, dogs and busy wives lead to a critical mass where the car just needs to get washed once a month.  I had some time so I took it to Danny's which was close by.  Bought the ""Royal"" wash which set me back nearly 30 bux.  I was sure my car would be clean enough to build a satellite in when I got it out the other side.

Well, after being chased around the exterior waiting area by bees for 45 minutes, I finally saw the attendant waving his rag at me that my car was done.  Or at least to their standards.

But not mine, oh heaven's no.  There was still bird poo on the roof.  When I pointed this out, the guy sheepishly griinned and made a half-hearted attempt to rub a few of them off with a rag.  When I scratched at a couple with my nail and they just came away, he just shrugged his shoulders.

We were in  a hurry at this point, so we just got in and sped off.  But wait, there's more.  While we were driving back to the house, we noticed that they hadn't vaccuumed around the inside of the car in any ""not so hard to reach"" areas like the center console or under the front of the seats.  I can sometimes forgive not getting in the nooks and crannies, but there was still TRASH in some of the places.  

Looking around more, I noticed that the car's interior handn't really been ""protected"" with the goo they use -- the tops of the doors, the dash top, and that's about it.  The center armrest was filthy and definitely not clean, and the back seats were still dry as a bone.  I noticed that the workers there obsess over new cars and cars with lots of chrome.  As I was dodging the killer bees I watched in amazement as the chrome bumper of a very large Ford pickup was polished like the mirror of the Hubble Telescope.

But they are totally phoning in the work on the family car.  My 8-year-old Volvo is far from a beater, but it doesn't compare to some of the exotic French and Italian stuff I used to have.  I still feel it should get the same attention, especially at $30."
5,"It was decided that the culmination of our Southwest trip would involve a ""grand finale"" for Mexican dining, so the burden was on the Yelp iPhone App as we sped toward Phoenix looking for a solid lunch place near the airport. Given that Yelp never fails, the deceptively named La Tolteca Mexican Foods was presented before us as an attractive option. Hesitant as to whether it was actually just a Mexican grocery store, we hustled in to see what the buzz was about. Now, I know I live in the Northeast (veritable Mexican food desert), but ""Oh. My. Gahhhhhhhhhhhhh..."" This place is amazing. 

One of the most appealing things to me about La Tolteca was its no-nonsense approach to everything. Food is ordered from a board menu above a counter and prepared in a small kitchen area in front of you. Slightly further back lies the grocery store component which does have an interesting (Maybe typical for Phoenix, but what do I know?) variety of Mexican groceries and specialties to recommend it. Back to the food though... that really was the main event. I ordered a chicken burrito which came out quickly and was f---ing enormous. Imagine the beams of light shining down from above when I turned around a spotted the salsa bar! I was able to taste all of their salsas including the piquant green chili pepper one which I am still thinking about. There's a vast dining area to the back where you can bring your food and beverage to gorge and take in this amazing experience. Maybe I just love Mexican food too much... Who knows, but I was really a happy camper here. 

We looked over and spotted some people eating burritos that were literally the size of loaves of Wonder Bread, so consider that as one more reason to go (though even I, self-proclaimed food eater extraordinaire could not fathom eating one of those). The prices are ridiculously cheap, and the food was amazing, flavorful and truly memorable. Overall, another highly recommended and worthwhile stop in Phoenix if you're nearby."
5,"I loved this place.  I've only been to one event here, but it was awesome.  I love how it's a historical house, and how they support local artists and events.  The staff was all very nice, the decorations were unbelievable, and the yard was beautiful

It looked like parking could be difficult, but we took a taxi which worked out perfectly.  Just be aware of parking issues if you drive."
1,The food wasn't very tasty. The bathrooms will make you leave and not even ask for your money back.
1,"Horrible service! 
A few friends and I walked into hooters ready to enjoy some wings and beer after a long day of work. We sat down and waited for some service. After about 10 minutes still no attention to our table. Joking around we raised our hands and asked for some attention to a group of hooter girls just hanging out at the bar and still nothing. After another 15 minutes we decided to walk up and go eat at tilted kilt down the street at city scape where the service was the complete opposite. I will never give that hooters my money and it sucks because I love their wings."
5,best bbq in madison
1,"I am really shocked at all of the decent reviews for this place.  The only reason I am giving it one star is because the service was fast and friendly.  I ordered the Seafood Bento box and my husband got the chicken teriyaki and a beef bowl. 

Midway through, we discussed going through the Wendy's drive through.  It just seemed like the lowest quality of everything was used- gross rice, fish with a weird texture, even the chicken seemed of a lower quality then you get at the Asian food places in the mall.

Tokyo Express actually was recommended to us, unfortunately, we wish we would have stayed home and cooked.

I would not recommend."
5,"Seriously the BEST Pad Thai I have ever had!  It was so fresh and had awesome veggies in it! I even tried my sons Curry and the chicken fried rice! Impressive! 
I can not wait to to go back! I was bummed it took so long but then I realized it was worth the wait!"
5,"Ryan's Pet supplies has it all, and is essentially the canine version of Disneyland.

When I first got my four-legged BFF, I was given a tip that there was a place that had dog gear nearly thirty percent less than the typical stores.

The store is centrally located on McDowell Road, and while the area is not exactly DC Ranch, you are not in the ghetto, and you will be perfectly safe even if you don't own an AR-15.

It is really important to note that Ryan's is set up as an internet order place, NOT as a retail store. This explains why the business does a few things differently than regular retail. Purses/bags either need to be left in your car, or the store will lock them up in the front. I recommend you bring your purse/bag inside, the staff is cool, and they will lock it up for you. While this may be an inconvenience , the price difference will easily make up for any hiccups.

The second tip that will save you time/energy is to know what you wish to purchase, and know how much it will cost. As mentioned before, it is a warehouse, and items are not labeled with price, it's a huge warehouse setup. They have catalogs all over the place to check prices, but my recommendation is to bring your catalog with pages marked of the stuff you want. The staff is super friendly, and will help you with where things are at. It's not always easy to know who works there, but you will figure it out, they're usually pushing metal carts, basically fulfilling online orders by pulling merchandise from the bins.

While you're here, you will find toys, brushes, shampoos, snacks, you name it! The prices are very very good, and you will be happily surprised at the difference between the other guys and Ryan's. Don't miss the kong squeaky toy line, they have fun squeaky toys that are hard to break. Also, the fleecy rope toys are great for dogs teeth, and keep them fresh and so clean clean. Avoid any rope toys, they can break down and when dogs eat them, they can do big time damage to stomach, GI etc.

Happy shopping, and lastly you CAN bring in your dog and have a helper while you shop."
1,"Took my phone for a screen repair and was told they needed to order the part, the repair would cost $200, the part would be in by Friday and the repair could be done while I waited.  The part didn't arrive when they predicted.  I was then told that the part would be in on Saturday and they would call me as soon as it arrived.  They didn't.  I called several times and was ultimately told that the part had ""just arrived.""  I said that I would come down immediately.  I arrived at 3:45 and was told they were closing in 15 minutes and had four repairs ahead of mine.  I decided to leave and work with a repair shop that would not waste my time.

I was initially hesitant to have the repair done at Sun Cellular because their shop area had parts and phones strewn everywhere in the repair area and I wondered if their business practices were as haphazard as their store.  In light of the fact that they quoted $200 for a screen repair and Yelp reviewers have them rated as ""inexpensive,"" you may want to question who is writing the reviews."
5,"The first time I went to Karamba's it was for Pride. I went for after hours and it was amazing! I paid my $5 cover fee and went into what looked like an industrial style bar. There were tables being hung from the celing and there were also a backdoor to the outside patio as well as a the ladies restroom. When we went deeper into the club, the blue hued bar gave way to the deep red dance floor. There were tables for dancing on as well as a plush looking chill section. 

The dance floor was PACKED with men grinding up on men, with women griding up on women and the ocassional straight couple peppered into the crowd as well as a few large groups of women dancing together. Oddly enough there's often a lot of straight women who go there with their bffs so they can dance in peace. There's some chairs and more hanging tables surrounding the dance floor. 

Then there's the outside patio... there's a few water foutains and a ton of patio chairs, benches and tables. Sometimes it feels like the patio is where the real party is at! 

Since that weekend, I've been a regular there. I'm sure if you venture there for afterhours some Friday or Saturday night you'll see yours truely tearing it up on the dance floor to some of the hottest hip-hop and reggeton around! If you do, pull me away from my friends and say hi! Hope to see ya'll there!"
1,"ZERO stars if I could.  Good Lord, has this place gone downhill.  First off, to the Jerry Garcia wannabe with all of the fake jewelry, do the owner a favor and just quit.  You are single-handedly killing his business.  You're rude, lazy and a downright tool.  He doesn't acknowledge you or say a word to you, and when he pay, he throws your card or change back at you like he's doing you a favor.  If you look up ""douche"" in the dictionary, it will be a picture of him.  The bread was stale, the beef was rubber, and the giardiniera was so oily it was ridiculous.  The bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks.  The toilet had a fresh floater staring back.  I will definitely never be back.  Easy to see now why the other two locations have closed.  I'll spend my 12 bucks where I'm appreciated."
1,My name is Matthew and i Ordered 2 cheese pizzas w/extra sauce. Was excited I received an email couponcoupon for a $10 pizza. Went to pick it up on way from work...and after I had a discussion with some of the employees about the coupon and number of pizzas I was  allowed by the manager James to have it honored. The staff before him said I could only have one pizza. So James settles it which was cool of him. Then I get home find out I have 2 pizzas w/o pizza sauce and only cheese. So I guess the lady that took down my order over the phone was confused. Why would anyone want only xtra cheese and  no pizza sauce?So I call James back to let him know what happen and he agreed to credit my ATM card. So least to say dinner was ruined for my kids/family. Now we are off to my son's baseball game starving. I now will wait patiently for my refund to post on my bank account. Oh what fun!
1,"I believe her name is Shannon or Sharon not quite sure but if you can avoid her do so by all means she extremely rude. I should of known that by the way she checked me in typically you walk in they check you in ASAP I come in and wait at the counter for 2 minutes or so after she greets me waiting for her to check me in once checked in she tells me it'll be a moment or two so take a seat. After she cleans her area I'm called up next during the haircut she ask me what I do after telling her I work for a financial firm I can see her roll her eyes in the mirror. After a few minutes into the haircut I request she doesn't shave my beard jokingly I say for insulation purposes she follows up by asking if I want the hair in my ear shaved or should she leave it for insulation purposes. I also requested to not trim the hair on top of just the back and sides, did she listen? Of course not. 

The absolute worse haircut I've had at this establishment."
5,OMG!!!! WOW I'm so amazed with my brazilian blow out.  Anna did an amazing job I'm so excited that I did it and will continue to do it.  It use to take an hour from wash to blow dry and straighten my hair.  It now takes 30minutes with a15 minute blow dry no straightener but I have the look like I used a straightener....I love this salon been coming for years and I enjoy all the staff.  They make you feel comfortable and they spoil u. Alma is my hairstylist and she is incredible as they all are....I love my perry salon thanks for helping me look amazing......
1,"Went to Zen for lunch today with a friend....waited at the hostess station for a server to seat us....no one came....finally the chef said we could sit anywhere...we sat down...waited ten minutes for a server to come to our table to just even bring us water and menus...never happened...we got up and left without ever seeing anyone. They only had about 10 customers on the patio and NO ONE inside but us....this was sad....we saw servers walking in and out and a few even made eye contact with us, but none approached us. Very sad....plus the place smelled like bad fish....this place has gone way down hill...sad! Worse service ever!!!!!"
1,"My cab was 30 minutes late -  I didn't receive a heads up from dispatch,  and they were reluctant to give me an  estimated arrival time. I almost missed my flight and will not be taking Union cab again."
5,"Rosita's Place is a Phoenix institution. Everyone who's anyone eats here, from former governor Bruce Babbitt to nobodies like me. My father used to tease me that I was ""born with a spoon of Rosita's refried beans in my mouth;"" I have been eating here for 40 years, and the waitress I remember from my childhood still works here.

From their humble beginnings on Buckeye road to their ""new"" (they've been here quite awhile) location on McDowell Rd near 24th street, the owners of this restaurant have won more accolades for delicious home-cooked Mexican food than anywhere else in the Valley of the Sun. The huge portions of food are cheap and consistently delicious, based on family recipes. You're likely to encounter a live mariachi band on weekends. 

The red sauce is hotter than the green, but not by much - they'll both smoke your brains out of your skull. Everything is good. Keep returning until you've tried all of it. My favorites: chile relleno with rice, beans & flour tortilla, albondigas soup, carnitas plate, and the refried beans in general.

Maybe it's because I've been dining at Rosita's Place regularly for my whole life, and they know me, but I never get slow service as has been mentioned in other reviews. Also, if you think this place is in the ghetto, and you don't like that you have to park in back where you can't see your car while you eat, you're too sheltered - in case you didn't notice, there is always a paid attendant keeping an eye on the parking lot!"
5,The portabella ravioli is sooo delicious.  My friends had lasagna and primavera and they raved about them as well.  Really great place for italian.
1,"First time here and from out of state, so of course we saw it on man vs food and wanted to check it out. Place is pretty cool as far as decoration but the food was awful. We had barbecue, nachos, hot wings, and the chipotle pasta (with cut up hot dog in it). Worst barbecue ever. Seemed like it was made a week ago and microwaved. Nice place to have a drink and watch a game, but avoid the food."
1,"I had been planning on getting a complete car detail, somewhere, and was still reading reviews on where to go, but needed a quick wash in the meantime, so I stopped by Dannys. The Dannys salesperson, Jorge, presented the complete detail package and although I explained I didn't have time to do it then the hard sale included ""we'll give you 3 free quick washes you can use 1 now, and come back for the detail when you have time. The price started high, then kept rapidly dropping and including more features the more I declined. Finally came down to the ""I give you good deal if you do it now, includes complete interior and exterior wash, engine clean, and more things just kept getting circled on the paperwork"". Out of exhaustion, sympathy for the people waiting in line behind me, vacuum people waiting ahead of me, and really needing the detail anyway, I gave in, signed the form, gave them my credit card, used my ""free"" quick wash and was on my way. (average job on the wash then, btw.) 
Part 2- 
Finally scheduled and went in for my detail. Upon arrival the ""greeter"" promptly looked in my window, read the damn ""need oil change"" service reminder that's been glaring at me for a few hundred miles, and suckered me in to that service too. (whatever- convenience to me). I explained I was there for my detail, They popped the hood, Jorge (again) said I he had given me a good deal but didn't I want the engine cleaned too? I tried to remind him he had included that in the deal, but apparently since he hadn't circled it, it wasn't really included. Jorge says ""I can't give that for free, you'd have to talk to the manager"". When I asked for the managers name, he seemed surprised that I would actually do it, so I did. The manager ""Alex"", was actually quite nice, gave me the engine detail, apologized and said he told Jorge to not push the sale so hard in the future. I was told 2.5- 3 hrs and I would get a call when it was done. So 4 hrs later, I call, find out it's done. Pay for the oil change, hunt down my car and someone w/ the keys. So-overall results, looked all bright and shiny at first, but they just gooped on extra armorall on my leather seats, still had finger smudges on the interior of the sun roof, white spots where the wax had not been rubbed off, small scratches that I'm pretty sure would have come out anywhere else. The kicker was on the inside of the windshield there were 2 spots where parking permits had left a residue (one with part of the paper liner still attached) and they didn't do ANYTHING to try to remove ANY of it. I drove away, again exhausted and vowing to write my first ever negative yelp review. Sorry for the long review, but I hope it helps someone save the time, money and energy. Good Luck!"
5,"Time for an update, as it's been 6 months since my initial review, and I've revisited at least 15 times since then.

+ The atmosphere can't be beat. Love the space.
- Still quite noisy; certain voices (and annoying laughs) seem to really carry here

+ The staff is excellent; honest, helpful, friendly, courteous - truly professional

+ Beer list remains nearly identical to what it was 6 months ago, and that's OK by me
+ Several taps on nitrogen - yummmmmmm

+ Now has outdoor patio behind the bar

+ The food is superb
+ Fried pickles - get them. (oh, and you're welcome)
+ Sandwiches - all are outstanding
+ Fish fry is very, very solid

+ Onsite ATM with reasonable service fee
- Cash only

Remains one of my very favorite places to visit."
1,Too expensive for a haircut.  Shoe shine?  I am wearing flip flops.  Everyone wanted tips.
5,"Man I cannot wait to go back!! The bullet wrap is delicious as is the asian chicken salad and wings! Awesomely fun atmosphere ""where rock meets jock"" all the novelty of the great Alice Cooper (WE'RE NOT WORTHYY!) alongside ginormous flat screens everywhere, perfect place to enjoy watching a game or bring friends!"
5,"Great food, . fast.  We carry out from there at least once a month, sometimes more."
1,"Ajo Als on 16th Street es no bueno, my girlfriend and her brother got food poisoning from here yesterday! that's just gross!"
5,"NOTE:  I only just got my car back so I cannot yet comment on the long-term resilience of the paint job.

My wife bought a new VW Passat in December and was hit by a dump truck in January. There was body damage to the driver-side front door, back door and rear quarter panel. Our insurance is with Geico who has an agent that works right out of ABRA's office. So I took it there for an assessment.

Everyone was extremely kind and helpful. The process of getting the estimate both by Geico and by ABRA was very quick and easy. Also, ABRA was nice enough to provide me with a rental car on their dime. Enterprise came out to ABRA's location and we took care of the rental there.  All I paid for was the insurance which was like $12-13/day.

ABRA sent daily updates via text message letting me know their progress and as soon as they had an estimated completion time, the let me know that as well.

I dropped it off on Tuesday, January 21 and they completed all the repairs and paint on Friday however I couldn't pick it up until Monday, January 27 as the paint needed to dry.  The car looks excellent!"
5,"Beer selection, meat market and convenience surpassed only by friendly and helpful staff. Produce section vastly proved over the last few years. The anti-Woodman's."
5,"Top quality furnture - if you are looking for the best of the best, shop at Red.  Also, the owner is very nice, and is always willing to help.  It's worth a visit even if you aren't considering making an actual purchase.  There are things there that you won't see anywhere else in this state."
5,"i travel a lot and no matter what city i find myself in, i make sure to hit up a bbq spot at least once during the trip. each and every one of those visits are compared to my bbq gold standard, fat jack's in monona. 

i'm actually leaving on sunday for yet another trip and i can say, without fail, on bbq night, one of my travel buddies at the table will ask, ""so... how'd it compare to fat jack's?""

chances are my response will be something like, ""it's good... but it ain't fat jack's!"""
5,This is where I was born! 28 years later I'm back to support my mother through surgery. I thought hospitals were dark and depressing but Banner Good Samaritan changed all that. The hospital is bright and sunny and the staff is genuinely nice and helpful. I would recommend this hospital to anyone.
5,"Sigh. I am in love.

What can be better than brunch/lunch in a quaint historic home adorned with kitschy antiques? Nothing! The answer is nothing.

We went here for a late lunch one Saturday, and it hit the spot. It was perfect. We all fell in love with the adorable house and its wooden floors, unique furniture and abundance of natural daylight. Our server was quite friendly and pleasant, and she let us take our time while also suggesting menu options.

We started with 3 sticky buns - a little rich for me, but very indulgent and sinful. Yum. My husband then moved on to a cheeseburger, which was very tasty. My friend ordered the turkey sandwich, which was bigger than big. I ordered a cup of soup and a half chicken salad sandwich. All of it was very satisfying and super filling. Of course, we couldn't pass on dessert, so we tried the bread pudding. Simply fabulous.

I am dying to go back for brunch...I'd love to try an omelet and mimosa here. I've heard the wait is bad, but we were seated immediately at 1:30pm on a Saturday. After living among the land of the strip mall in North Scottsdale, Coronado Cafe was a much needed and welcome change!

Any place that makes me feel like I am back in New Orleans will win my heart, and Coronado Cafe did just that."
1,"After making a dinner reservation for two, arrived to find several people waiting.  We waited 15 mins past our reservation time and with no other choice, were seated at an after-thought, tv tray-sized table crammed into the corner behind the frosted glass partition at the front door.  On top of that lovely description, every time someone went in or out the door, it slammed against the glass and sounded like a gunshot.  This was enjoyed during our one drink and appetizer before leaving.  So if you're a party of two, be forewarned."
1,"Yes, the food is good - some things, like the Brie appetizer are even great. I wanted to try the lamb, the house speciality, but they were out. My date's pork was good - the risotto it came with was delicious. My sea bass was slightly overcooked and I didn't care for the relish it came with. I like the ambiance, my date disagreed - he thought it was loud - it's true we could hear all the conversations around us; but food and ambiance aside, my gripe is with CST's customer service.

I purchased a $25 gift certificate for CDT on restaurants.com a month ago. When we went to redeem it, we were told, ""oh, i'm sorry, we don't honor those anymore...you should be able to contact restaurants.com and get a refund."" End of story. No visit from the manager, no complimentary desert. Nothing.

We were not the only people that came in that night trying to use our certificate, the table next to us also had one. We went in that night because of the certificate - some people get them to try a new place - i got it cause i needed a little extra incentive to go back to CDT - I remembered the food being good but a bit pricy - $25 off seemed like a nice discount. Whatever, the reason, restaurants count on sites such as restaurants.com to bring in people to their establishments. We upheld our end of the agreement - we went in, ordered more  than just the 2 entree min (app, salad, corakge fee) but CDT did not uphold their end of the agreement - and in my opnion, that is horrible customer service. The certificate was supposed  to be good for a year - it's not like we tried  to use it close to the expiration date, I tried using it one month after purchasing it. Even worse is that CDT has not contacted restaurants.com to let them know that they are no longer honoring it.

Luring customers with a gift certificate and not honoring it is a bad business practice."
1,"This place is deceptive. The lobby is recently renovated, kind warm receptionist, free parking, but OH MAN are the rooms disgusting. 

I don't know if they are currently under renovations but my room was old and dirty. 

Some points of concern:
Trash was still in the trash bins.
Kitchenette looked like it hadn't been used in years and the fridge had a strange smell
Weird spare day bed in room with sheets that looked like they hadn't been changed in a while
Wallpaper peeling off the wall
Strange locked closet in my room. 
Creepy dudes hanging out in the parking lot ALL DAY 
Paper thin walls 

This place will do if your traveling through for 1 night but these rooms are set up for extended stays - I wouldn't want to spend any length of time in there"
5,"Thank God! When I was an undergrad in Madison back in 96, we scoured the city in search of decent bbq to no avail. I'm moving back in August and now know at least 3 places where I will be dining in that first week. This is one of them and I look forward to it. It just unfortunate that it's on a street named after the Packers... boo. Go Bears ;)"
5,"This little off shoot of Pizza Bianco is quaint and a nice place to stop for one amazing antipasto!! Wow it had fabulous marinated grilled veggies a la broccoli, asparagus, tomatoes, and squash... The bartender was amazing!!  The beer selection is good, both drafts and bottles.  The wine list looked good too!

I had wanted to order from pizza bianco, but they don't do to go orders... So that's not good?!!  

Parking is... Well pretty non-existent but the valet is awesome, he saved my day!"
5,"The ribs were the best I have ever had. The BBQ sauce is probably the best I have had. And everything is very smokey flavored, which, for me, is a very good thing. I had a chance to also try the chicken (awesome) and brisket (decent, but not amazing). 

For the sides, I got corn and the French fries. This was surprising for me but the fries were average and the corn was unbelievable. I pretty much assume corn is corn, but not here. 

Finally, I liked the style of the place. It is a hole in the wall without man tables. I like that and recommend everyone to head there."
5,Purchased a groupon for this place.  The service was excellent and the deluxe prime rib sandwich and the chipolte burger were fantastic.  You can bet we will visit again wifalsethout
1,"OVERPRICED AND OVERRATED!!!!

I cannot believe how much money I spent here for two sandwiches and two sodas.  $25.46

The mozzerlla panini had tasteless tomatoes, the thinnest slice of procutto that had a large peice of fat in it causing me to nearly gag.  Plesto sauce was okay.

The roast beef sandwhich was a huge dissappointement.  Two thick slices of overdone beef, two thick slices of cheese and a tasteless tomatoe with the top hard vine connector still attached (who wants to eat that?).  When I say thick, I mean, 1/6 thick but did not cover from side to side of the bread.  

These sandwhiches were $9.50 each!!!!

We got one with pasta salad (corkscrew pasta and a dressing, no veggies or color) and a green salad (lettuce and dressing, nothing else).

We also got two diet cokes.  In a can!!!!  For $2.25 each!!  They did'nt offer a glass, ice and straw which in my oppinion might account for the upcharge, but no, nothing, niet.

This place might be okay if you are in the area, at the building working or visiting someone, but we drove from Ahwatukee.  So not worth it.  Do not drive to this place.  Do not go out of your way for this place."
5,"The lunch buffet from 11:30 to 3pm is crazy delicious!  Weekend buffet is 10 dollars a person.  Try a little bit of this and that, take what you want, leave what you don't.  Great food, good service.  I recently went to their Odana Rd location on the West side for dinner and the food was still very, very good, but the price was nuts!  So stick with the lunch buffet and you will have happy belly and happy wallet."
5,I have been coming to Serenity Salon and Day Spa since Darcy opened in 2002.  Darcy is my stylist but I have seen Andrea and Casey as well and they are just as great.   The service has always been exceptional and very professional.  I have experienced most services there and have never been disappointed.  The atmosphere is so calming and friendly.  I recommend Serenity Salon to everyone I know. In fact even my Mom and daughters go there. The owner Darcy takes pride in her business and her attention to detail helps to make the experience fantastic!  You won't be disappointed!
5,Best Chinese food madison! I've tried them all and make the 15 minute drive every week :-)
1,They charge more than the services they provide are worth.  Since they currently have a monopoly on cable tv in the madison area there is nothing anyone can do about it.
5,"Crandalls has moved to state street, and is now serving authentic Peruvian food! We went there for dinner tonight, and it was fabulous. I highly recommend the cheese empanadas, solterito (fava bean and corn salad), and the chaufa de quinoa (like fried rice but with quinoa)! They make chicha morada, which is a drink made from purple corn, and is super refreshing.

Crandalls is owned by a very sweet family from Peru, and I'm so happy to see that they are now showcasing their roots with their new restaurant!!

They do still have their famous fish fry, and it looked like the lunch menu has cheese curds and sandwiches as well as ceviche."
1,"Horrible service, old flowers.  Tons of swearing and screaming coming from the back room, very unprofessional."
5,Wow my friend found them on yelp what amazing food had welcome burger excellent.   Also had the corn dog appetizers wow the ladies I was with said it's the best hurricane they have ever had.  Great job guys a definite go to location for everyone. ..
1,"Service here is awful.  Came in to a not so busy restaurant and was never seated, even after 3 groups of people came in after us.  They seemed to have a lot of people doing nothing.  I wouldn't recommend this place at all."
5,"Love this place. Had the two tacos, rice and beans. I'm so happy right now, haven't had Mexican food like that in a long time. I'll be back probably way too often. Highly recommended."
5,"I am a huge Teriyaki chicken fan, so I tried this place based on Yelp reviews.  My fellow yelp'ers weren't far off the mark.  I ordered the white meat Teriyaki Chicken bowl with brown rice, along with a pork egg roll and a large drink.  The meal arrived at my table quickly.  Upon first bite, I was taken aback because the teriyaki sauces I've tried are really, really sweet.  This sauce is not as sweet, but much more flavorful.  The egg roll was good, but the sweet/sour sauce it came with was better than I've ever had.  Simple, sweet, and not gooey or gloopy.  

One of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.  

Everyone seemed to be hurrying around, but they were all doing a great job keeping the customers happy by refilling drinks, delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop.

All in all, a great experience.  I told the owner I would be back with my son by the end of the week, and I plan to keep my promise!  Great job, Blue Fin!"
1,"Eight of us went to Manuel's today for lunch, and I can say that the service was the WORST I have ever seen in any restaurant.  

Six of us got our meals at the same time, while the other two (who ordered the daily special) got theirs  EIGHT MINUTES AFTER the rest of us.  

We didn't see the server again until he brought our bill.  We had asked him for separate tickets...and only got one.  We never got a single refill on the iced teas that four of us paid $2.50 each for...ten bucks would buy a LOT of tea bags.

An 84-year-old woman in our party asked for her water in a styrofoam cup with a straw, which the server said he would bring her but he never did.

The food was unimpressive...greasy and fried.  I would go to Taco Bell before I went back to Manuel's, which is overpriced.  I wouldn't have minded the mediocre food, but the service sucks like an Electrolux."
5,"Went to Cooperstown for lunch today. It was amazing!!! The Big Unit was huge and I had the whole works on it. I'm really not a big fan of sauerkraut, tomatoes, and onions but I went for it cuz it had bacon...and you know...bacon makes everything better. =o) The Big Unit is 22 inches long that was covered with chili, bacon, cheese, onions, tomatoes, sauerkraut, and relish. Hmmm...maybe I left off some toppings and it came with side of fries. This is definitely a meal that you can share with someone. It's just under 20 bucks. Oh...when they come out to serve the food the bell rings and they scream ""BIG UNIT!!!"" 

By the way...please remember to bring quarters when you come to this place. A minute away from the place we realized we forgot to check if we had quarters. Luckily, I had quarters otherwise we would have had to detour for some quarters. 

The service was great and quick. The place was clean and the staff was friendly."
1,"They no longer have a flower shop.  I went in looking for a BIG ""vase"" to hold a big bunch of flowers.  After poking around for a couple minutes I asked an employee for such.  He walked me over to another woman who repeated my request a couple times (a vase?  a VASE?).  Ok, wft woman, I have a bunch of flowers for my dad's memorial service, I've got 10 minutes to find something to put them in before I shove them up your a$$.  Yes, I was a little stressed.  She went in to this long thing about how they didn't have a flower shop any more and they might have a few in the back but they weren't priced to sell.  I interrupted her and said, ""So the answer is no?""  I asked twice.  She wouldn't give me an answer.  I started walking out.  There were a bunch of, forgive me, ""Hurricane glasses"" which would suit my needs just marvy.  I picked one up and started looking around for something better.  Bitch woman saw me and said, ""Oh, well, we DO have CANDLEHOLDERS"".  Didn't offer to help me anymore.  I made a point of picking up just about every single one I could find.  Apparently, ""vase"" is a technical term reserved for something very special.
Anyway, I bought something and ended up returning it the next day because the same thing at Cost Plus was $9 rather than $27.
Poor service, high prices, crappy selection.  Fail."
5,"Our family of four dined at Vin Santo the Monday after the new year.  We expected it to be quiet but it was a happy busy place.  The lone chef in the kitchen kept food coming at a steady pace, quicker then anticipated.  The two wait staff was attentive, friendly and very professional.  
  
We had a white pizza appetizer, loved the dried tomato pesto.  We each ordered an entree which were all very good.  The  fine sauces, ingredients and preparation was far superior/delicious compared to the usual Italian restaurant!!  Portions were very large so three of us enjoyed them again the next day.  We enjoyed tastes of two desserts, tirimisu and bread pudding.  Again treats for the next day.

Great food, great service and a casual friendly atmosphere, a restaurant  to return to again and again!!"
5,"After moving from Chicago to Madison, I thought that I would be safely tucking my Lebanese palate into the furthest recesses of my tongue, saving it only for the occasional trips back to Kedzie Avenue.  That was, until my wife and I discovered People's bakery.  

Upon walking in, I was thrown back into the likes of such wonderful restaurants as Salam and Semiramis...but with Donuts!  We were genuinely welcomed in and I knew People's Bakery was gonna be one of my new spots, having not even tried a single thing in the store.  

We ordered a lunch ""to-go.""  I got a Shish Taouk (commonly known as a Chicken Shawarma) and my wife got a falafel sandwich and we split a side of Hummus.  Well, my Shish Tauok was plump with heavily marinated, tender chicken slices, tomatoes, tahina, and lettuce.  In short, it was outstanding.  Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur.  The hummus was really good, and the spike of sumac was a nice touch, although it was tad bit to lemony for me.  

Nonetheless, this is an AWESOME Madtown ethnic eats spot...and oh yeah...how can  completely dismiss the incredible homemade donut selection?  They looked stunningly good, but we both left that for another day.  Lebanese food and donuts....a winning combination, in my book."
5,"Man but this place kicks ass.  Incredible, inventive, decadent food.  BITCHING cocktails (try one and you'll see).  Open til 12 on Sunday night.  (Yes!)  Totally savvy musical selections, always. Straight up & personable folks making and serving everything.  The real locals deal.  Feel like I need to go here as much as possible, before it totally blows up and there's no getting a seat.  Big love."
1,"I had the red beans and white rice with cornbread, dirty rice, fries. Not quite what my granny used to make. But the dirty rice was spicy and I added it to the bland white rice and beans to add flavor to it. It was ok buy upset my stomach. Cornbread was dense and moist? Flavorless though. I wanted some warm buttery cornbread goodness. Nope. The fries and bbq sauce was all I liked in my order."
5,"Do you love good food?
Duh.
Do you love good drinks?
Of course.
Do you love good people?
Who doesn't?!
If you've answered yes to any of these questions (and we both know you did), you need to get down to The Welcome Diner. The cozy quarters and kitchy decor make it easy to fall in love with, and the staff makes you comfortable enough to stay for hours.
AND THE FOOD! I have yet to try something that didn't make me smile. It's hard to pick a favorite dish but personally, I love the Kiltlifter braised pork biscuit. The carolina mustard sauce that's made in house, is probably the best thing I've ever tasted. And the made from scratch biscuit it comes with, is too good for words. 
Beyond a fantastic, locally driven food concept, they also make one of the greatest cocktails I've ever enjoyed; the Hurricane. And even though you clearly hear the bell dinging from the kitchen and everyone inside scream, ""HURRICANE!"" each time you order one, you just can't seem to figure out how you got so tipsy; they're sneaky little guys. 
So, next time you're out and about downtown Phoenix on a weekend, you should go say hi, and then eat your face off. You'll be glad you did."
1,Not good. Sorry. I can get pass the decor if the food was good. Keep going. Big warehouse style with table and chairs at the end. Some good reviews???? Must be the workers.  No Flavor unless you add the sauce (a lot)! The server was very kind. So close to Mexico we thought it would be a no brainer.
1,"Come on, Safeway.  You are pretty much the only game in town for downtown right now.  You would think your corporate office would recognize this and remodel and class this place up a bit.  You have people who have money to spend living all over downtown Phoenix now.  The store needs to clean up its act, improve its customer service and cater to a new demographic emerging downtown.  If I had a new better choice downtown, I would never step back in this rundown location."
1,"Only reason I come here is because I get $5 off the total before 9am on Sunday. This recent experience, they forgot to clean the dashboard (dust, dust and more dust) and I almost drove off with the marker of my wash on my windshield?! Those are the two most important parts to clean after a car wash!!!!

If I didn't need to come here, I wouldn't. Plain and simple."
5,"After walking around & viewing their huge selection of goodies, I had to look  up to avoid temptations hahaha.... they offer free samples of current goodies & coffee... had every flavor you could think of for cookies, cupcakes, muffins, breads, some candies..... I WILL RETURN...."
1,"I'm giving one star, because there is no negative star. If you like the food the serve in institutions this is the place for you. No flavor and it tasted like it came right out of the box or bag. The one thing that did have flavor was the coffee, unfortunately the flavor was bad. It's 2013, time update your menu & restaurant. 

We want be going back anytime soon, unless I have a craving for 1970's school cafeteria food."
5,"I have no idea what kind of Michelin 4-star restaurant some of these reviewers are used to, but their poor ratings of this Madison staple are not to be taken seriously. 

Coming from someone who's worked professionally in the food industry for the better part of the past decade, in bars, cafes, diners, organic kitchens, and hotels, this diner-style family eatery will always remain one of my absolute favorite places to go, for any meal of the day. This, more than any other restaurant in Madison, is what I missed when we moved away. 

Let's review:
1. One of the most creative, delicious, varied, and comprehensive vegetarian and vegan menus I've ever seen, especially for a place that specializes in heartwarming diner-style dishes. I'm a dedicated omnivore, and my favorite things to order off the menu were the Heathen Vegan Shoplifter's Delight, and the Zucchini Potato Pancakes (both vegan).
2. The person who complained about the terrible service...I have no idea what she was talking about. In the 4 years I lived in Madison, I ate there on an average of once a month, and my servers were always friendly, responsive, and as prompt as could be expected during varied levels of busy-ness. 
3. The cook regularly comes out to chit-chat and joke with the customers. It's always a treat. :)
4. They work hard to support local farmers, with dedicated local and organic specials featuring produce, meats and dairy from area growers. 
5. Their homemade biscuits are to DIE for.
6. Try the pies. And the cakes. Do it. If you can't eat another bite, take a slice home. I promise, you won't regret it!

I've never had a disappointing meal there. I miss it like a long-lost lover."
1,"Remember when East Towne mall was nothing?  A big building full of emptiness, speckled with a few pathetic stores here and there?  Ten to 15 years later, and now its been completely revamped and is all dolled up with white twinkly lights, and cheesy holiday decorations.  Hell, even Santa shows up there now.  

But guess what?  You can't just walk around the mall without some dipstick wanting you to try on their lotion or straighten your hair for you!!!  Isn't that exciting?  It's like being harassed by a car salesperson, only these people want to let you know how ugly you are, and how they can improve you with their shit products.  

Do you want to try this wonderful lotion?  Can I straighten your hair for you?  Can I ask you a question about your skin??!  Can I ruin this trip to the mall for you by refusing to leave you alone every time you walk by?!?!  

YES!!!!  It's like getting a root canal and then asking for a do over.  Because, even if you politely say no thank you, they persist, and harass, and then as you are walking away, you hear them say snide little things about you.    

I hate those pushy bastards.  They ruin every, single trip to the mall."
5,"So I've been here twice.  Both times, I thought the food was excellent.  Sam's enchiladas, while non-traditional, are admittedly my favorite in town; they are significantly better than Barrio Café.  The portions are huge; the prices, very reasonable; and the atmosphere, especially the beautiful outdoor patio near the fountain, is fantastic on nice Phoenix days.  

And this is all before you consider the chips.  Good gracious, the chips and salsa!  Five star worthy chips and salsa."
5,"Grew up eating this! We walk right through the back door. Dont come here if your looking for atmosphere.Its all about the hot, fresh crispy food. Looove the pork fried rice, sesame chicken, ice tea and those big ass deliciously fried egg rolls! The oldies playing in the back deffinatley sets the mood. Family music right there. This place is love."
5,"My favorite car wash! Super friendly service, reasonable prices and I always leave with my car sparkling clean."
1,"I really wanted to like this place. I live nearby and I love the Downtown area. I want all the places here to be 4-5 star joints. But my partner and I showed up on a Sunday afternoon, with only a half-dozen people in the place and just as many waitresses, and they still took 45 minutes to deliver our food. We watched our waitress eat her lunch at the bar. And then when our food came it wasn't right.

We ordered a sandwich that was piled high with turkey. One bite, however, and we knew our bread was more than day-old. I actually had to ask them if it was toasted (it wasn't) because it was just as hard and dry as a piece of toasted bread. Back it went.

The pizza which I ordered because of the Kalamata Olives (their ""Mediteranean"") was missing Kalamata Olives. That's right -- it's the major ingredient on the pie and the joker in the kitchen forgot to put them on. 

Never mind, after 45 minutes you'll eat anything. Beer was overpriced at $5 for a glass. We got out of there as quickly as we could after the food was consumed. Won't be back."
1,"I hate to be an asshole, but I hated this place. 

I came here yesterday with a group of friends for lunch. Our 15 minute wait turned into what felt like an hour, when impatient me finally went in to see what the deal was... To my surprise, there was an empty table for a party of 7 that was just sitting there. Are you kidding me? So I ask one of the servers if its cool that we snag it, to which he said Yes. Just cram in tight. NO big deal. So I go and grab my friends to alert them that the table was ready, and when I walk back in, some stupid little bitchy server is standing there glaring at me telling me she ""needs a minute to move the table"" while huffing and puffing and sighing and just generally being a little queen about having to move a freakin table. I'm sorry, isn't it your JOB to accommodate patrons? I thanked her as she stormed off, and say something shitty to her about being such an inconvenience. I never saw her again throughout the duration of my visit. 

Star removal #1.

We all sit down, and continue waiting for our drink order to be placed. Finally, after about 10 minutes, this happens, but were without menus, so no one *really* knows what they want, Waitress huffs, rolls her eyes, and goes to grab menus. We look, she takes our order, but only for about 6 of the 8 people at the table. She somehow forgot about the tallest man at the table and the girl sitting across from him. Once she comes back, after 3 attempts, she gets the order wrong, serves me my sake without a cup or a glass for my beer. Seriously?

Star removal #2.

We finally order. Mind you, this was the longest lunch in the universe, because at this point we had already been there for an hour. Luckily our waitress got the order correct, except a few of us ended up waiting at least 45 minutes for our rolls to come out.. specifically the Avocado rolls.. did you run to California to grow and pick them yourself because.. wow. 

Star removal #3.

They managed to Eff up the most important part, which was the SUSHI. My unagi was not fresh, the spicy tuna tasted like plastic, they only had smoked salmon, no raw. They waitress *highly* recommended the dessert roll, which was ice cream rolled in rice krispys.. I know that sounds awesome and all, but im here for sushi, not ice cream. Also, on the menus, it says they have the choice to put a grat on ANY size party.. this to me is absolutely absurd.

Star Removal #4

I'm sorry, but when you see a PARTY OF EIGHT slide in, you do everything in your power to make these people happy, because if you don't, you can expect that ""We can grat anyone we want"" to be the only grat you get. Nothing additonal.

Get your shit together Moto, and maybe remind your waitstaff that their JOB is to make sure your patrons enjoy themselves, not make us feel like a burden. If it weren't for them, this review wouldn't have been so shitty.

P.S. Start to finish, lunch took 2.5 hours. 

FAIL."
5,"Now called the US Airways Center, this is one of my favorite places to be. Not only because I am a huge Suns fan (which I am), but it's just a generally good vibe in there. Food is, well stadium food, but who goes for the food? The sound system is good and the seating structure is intuitive and easy to navigate. 

The Suns still have the best introduction ceremony I have ever seen and I think a big part of it is this arena."
5,"the best of everything food and atmosphere, nothing like it."
1,"I have gone to Apollo's on occasion over the years even before they remodeled. I don't live in the immediate vicinity so I only stop in when in the area and the mood strikes.  The crowd can be diverse but generally tame. I had the recent displeasure of stopping in on a Wednesday with two friends visiting from S.F. The crowd was sparse and we sat at the bar. A young 90's slacker looking bar tender came to take our order. We ordered a rum and coke, LI iced tea, and an apple martini. Upon hearing the apple martini the slacker started to belittle my friends order as being REALLY gay and  had an attitude. At first maybe it could be taken as humorous banter but when he came back with the 1st two drinks he continued in the same vein with the comments and put out attitude. After serving the drink he commented that he hoped it was ok because he never made one before(in a condescending tone). Well, the drink sucked and my friend ordered and was served a beer only after the bartender threw the Martini out in a huff. Needless to say we left as soon as we finished our drinks. I was totally embarrassed. My friends certainly got a poor look at the Phoenix gay scene and what I thought was supposed to be a fairly decent bar and not a dive bar. When I paid the tab the ticket said Hippie Boy which I assume is the bartenders nickname. Imagine that, asking for a Martini at a gay bar and being ridiculed for it as being too gay. The thing is had we had gotten good service we would have stayed for a few more of those expensive gay drinks. Well Apollo's will never get my money again."
5,"Was seated right away.got coffee within 3 minutes of being seated. The waitress was fantastic! Very helpful friendly, and kept coffee full, and plates cleared. Food was fresh and hot. Honesty best dining experience at an IHOP I have ever had. Keep up the great work! I would definitely go back again!"
1,"I know alot of people seem to like this place,but you wont see me going there again.We had some friends in from Boston,and they wanted to eat somewhere that wasnt very fancy,so we picked Cheesecake factory.You should know that our groupd consisted of our 2 friends,my husband,my 4 yr old son and my 2 yr old son,and myslef who was 9 months preggers at the time.
               When we got there,it was extremely crowded,we gave them our name and they said 10 minutes tops.Well 40 minutes later we were finally seated.The waitress was nice but stuffed us in to a very small booth.She was slow bringing our drinks and our apps,and only refilled our drinks once.
           All of this could have been forgiven if the food was good.My husband and friend Tim ordered the steak both medium rare,what they got was a piece of meat smaller than the palm of my hand fully cooked.I ordered the Philly Cheese sandwhich,it had no flavor and tasted like it just came out of the microwave.Ive bought better at Wal-Mart.I ordered two kids chicken finger dinners for my boys but they only brought out 1 and when I told the waitress,she insisted that I only said one and that maybe the boys should share because the kitchen was really busy.
                    I will never go to this restaurant again,bad service,horrible food,and not a good value at all."
5,"I started going here on and off about eight years ago. The pizza is the best, but the burgers (veggie and regular) are very good as well. It's bar food at its very best. Hot chips with dipping sauce are good too! There's often bands on the weekends, and the occasional lesbian after bowling league get together, but not angry, man-hating, shemales. Quite a few different groups of people get together for good beer, food and music at reasonable prices."
1,"This rating is for the sharpening service that's performed on site and isn't a review or rating of the pet supply. After making my purchases at Ryan's I went to the adjoining building that advertised professional sharpening. 
To make my long story short my Tanto edge was ruined and the serrated edge ground down to a flat ridge. The edge that was suppose to be sharp had a rough edge as though it was put to a sander and not buffed to the mirror finish I'm used to.
I mentioned that the edge was ruined but the clerk didn't seem to know what to say.

Needless to say I'll be shipping my knives back to the manufacturer for reconditioning from now on."
1,"I am NOT a fan of Karsh's. When i moved to Phoenix many years ago, everyone made a fuss about getting their baked goods from Karsh's. I was really looking forward to what i expected would be wonderful baked things. They weren't. They were tasteless... Everything is the same tasteless flavor. There is pink iced tasteless, white iced tasteless... they have mastered the use of food color.... but it doesn't overcome the tastelessness. The only thing Karsh's has going for them is that they are a Kosher Bakery. I suppose that gives them a ""captive"" audience. There will always be a community of people who cannot buy their things anywhere else because they require Kosher goods. 

There is one exception at Karsh's. They make a wicked fine Challah. Everything else leaves me flat."
1,"No vegetarian options, and staff always too busy and not personable."
1,I avoid this place!  They don't care about their neighbors and play extrememly loud music on Saturday nights till 2am keeping many locals awake.  The staff doesn't seem to care about this issue either. I will not go there until they change their practices.
1,"Yikes!  What happened to this place?  I haven't been to this location in a couple of years.  Its awful!  So sad that management let it go!  Maybe new owners? I remember I used to come here and shop for greeting cards while my car was being washed.  The card racks are all empty.  All the snack and candy bar boxes are empty, too. But no one has bothered to remove the empty boxes.  There's a few dusty old stuffed animals And just a few air fresheners for sale. They used to take pride in displaying their merchandise. Not anymore. Even the fish tank looks awful.

I hope they did a good job with by oil change but I really have no way of knowing. My VIP wash was not worth the money. The inside was not vacuumed very well and their armor all is streaked and missing in places.

The entire visit was totally disappointing. But the worst part is that my glove box has clearly been rifled through. I keep my papers in a particular order with my sunglasses on top. When I went in the glove box to get my sunglasses everything was topsy-turvy and the sunglasses were on the bottom.  What reason would the staff have to rummage through my glove box?

I wonder if all of the locations are experiencing a similar decline.  I will never return."
5,"[DISCLAIMER: the rating of five stars for Bandaids does not directly correlate with the intentions of the establishment, instead, the volumes of unintentional comedy and unsolicited astonishment that may be had at this specific joint]

Walking into Bandaids was like witnessing the sneak premier of the cinematic masterpiece 'Showgirls' -- and what I mean is, one is piqued with curiosity, wonderment, the promise of mindblowing mockery, and the anticipation of an inevitable Spidey exit.  This is where the comparison to showgirls ends.  Actually, I don't rememer.  Did showgirls feature a stripper in her 3rd trimester?

Whereas the tagline for Showgirls was ""Leave your inhibitions at the door"", Bandaids follows up with ""... and your guns, knives, nerve gases, babies, peg legs, raptor jesuses, gold crown deodorizers, and herpes.""  Although I think most in there ignored that last one.

So, upon entrance, you are greeted with a very Judge Dredd-like chain-link protected cashier who takes your Abe Lincoln and motions you over to the bar.  One thing about strip clubs in general, is, you don't really wanna schooch by anyone ... but at Bandaids, they make this awkward dream a reality for everyone!  The walk up to the bar is like cutting to seats 34 and 35 at Giants Stadium.  I felt like Tyler Durden contemplating whether to give the vatos the butt or the crotch as they stare blankly at ""the talent"".

Whoa boy.  This place has talent like the old Washington Bullets ... but shorter, fatter, and more pregnant.

I gave one of my buddies a dollar to snap into one of the monster's string and she gave him a ""whusssuuup"" that featured her sweet gold grill.  To appreciate this, you must know that my friend is quite possibly the sweetest guy on the planet, and gave a friendly ""Hi!"" to her in return before about-facing to our bistro style table where 8 Coors Lights were posting up our jaws.

This was a nice, natural cue for a quick exit, rattled our half-drained beers into the bins and shot out.  We couldn't stomach anymore of anything.

But wait.

On this page you will notice Jason C., and along with the others in our laughter-induced group, came his big mouth.  This was his opportunity to mock the sawed-off, convertible, primer-gray Chevy Blazer parked mere feet from the entrance/exit to Bandaids, and although the details are lost as to the specifics, mentioned something about ""check out THIS fucking thing!"", which was the perfect timing for one of the busted, ghetto-flab strippers to walk out and proceed to angrily say something like ""Fuck you.  That's mine.  What of it?""  In response, and generally because he's a giant puss with scary strippers, said something like, ""Oh.  Its nice.  I like it."" before shitting himself.

I'm sure the rest of the group howling with laughter really set her mind at peace.  

Anyway.  That's the Bandaids story, and you can have one just like it if you give it a chance."
5,WwoOOW!  It is really that good here!  If u don't stop u are missing out BIG TIME!  Great food!
5,"I must say perfect... I travel for work and it was great to check into my room, find Rosati's on Yelp and have them here within 30 minutes. The food was much more than I anticipated...  A MUST try. Very well seasoned and the service was great from the phone call to the delivery... 5 stars all around!  The Spinach and Tomato Garlic bread was delicious!"
5,"Stunning haircuts and service!  Marina is a highly skilled stylist; I recommend her for her beautiful cuts and personality.  I have never been disappointed by the service provided by any/all staff at this salon.  The atmosphere is fantastic! Complimentary beverages, scalp and hand massages, make-up touch ups, free parking....so many perks.  Unparalleled value.  It is truly not a surprise to see that many of the customers have long-term relationships with stylists at this salon."
5,"Some of the best Mexican food in the valley! The ribs, el pastor gorditas and chicken chimichangas are some of my favorites. The prices are also very affordable!"
1,"Outdated clothing selection, rude lady working in the shoe department actually looked at me with surprise when I greeted her (she hadn't acknowledged me even after making eye contact, so I said ""Hi! How are you?"".)  

I was hoping to buy a new pair of boots. Not so much after getting treated so gruffly by the shoe sales person. The lady stared at me with surprise, like I interrupted her thoughts about tonight's meatloaf dinner. After a few seconds, she replied in a muffled grunt, ""uh....hi"". (What's that about?)

I left wondering what kind of 1980s throwback time machine this place must be. Unorganized, dated clothing. Odd smell. Very disappointed."
5,Very good mexican food.   Authentic in taste and atmosphere.  The Fajita Guadalajara is our favorite.  We share it and there's plenty for both of us.
1,"Oh man.... I always highly recommended people to go here. Especially people from out of town. I was there over the weekend and the GM thought it would be a fanatic idea to throw one new server into the mix and see how she does. However no one was watching or training her. Took drink order after waiting 15minute and then proceeded to ask about my drink 3 more times over 30minutes. Then the GM who was in and out smoking constantly and reeked of cigarettes came over and offered us free shots. I asked the server what was in it and she said, ""I'm just going to lie and say it has flavored vodka and lime juice."" And then giggled. No but really... What is this? She giggled again and walked away. Took another 17min to get a second round. It was mortifying to show my friend who is a doctor in NYC, this so called ""loungy chic sophisticated bar"", that just fell flat. He and myself were so disappointed and consistently joked about never going back ever again. But seriously... Never going back. Step up your game Merc. Especially on a busy Friday or Saturday night!!"
5,"I work downtown in the same building as ""The Duck."" So handy to grab a snack, a soda, and the staff is super friendly and helpful. Everything from wonderful cheese spreads to bagels to super awesome sandwiches. You can't beat it!

You know it is a great place when you walk in and smell the baking and cooking going on and immediately you have to have something. Everything is fresh and made to order. Just the way you like it.

I would highly recommend Duck & Decanter! Yum!!

5,"I can't believe I haven't written a review for the Phoenix Symphony since I've been a regular here for the last 3 years!
I've brought my son here to see the Nutcracker performed by the AZ Ballet since he was two. And we're season subscribers to the Phoenix Symphony Family Series for the last two years. 
We have tickets in the Orchestra section so my son who is 5 can see all the musicians up close and personal to keep his attention.  I love how they add a little kid friendly entertainment and/or performance to each concert to make it fun for the little ones. Also love the family activities an hour prior to start of concert. 
While there is no dress code, it's always nice to use this occasion to dress up my son a little so he knows we are going to some place special."
1,"Horrible and fake! This is by far the WORST Mexican food that I have ever experienced.
At first glance I was disappointed by the menu, then the chips and salsa came. Chips, bland but texturally good. Salsa, canned, fake and simply unacceptable. This is the point where I should have ran for the exit.
I reluctantly ordered an asada taco only to be asked ""you mean a steak taco?"" My second cue to run for the door. 
Then the food came. The beans are either freeze dried or frozen and oddly nutty. I perceive this at their very poor attempt to shine up a ball of fecal matter. The rice, meh, but edible. The asada or ""steak"" at this MEXICAN restaurant, a saucy mess.
I'll spare you all the rest of this mess of a meal. 
Oh, my official Tip for this restaurant:
If you must eat here, come for happy hour, have 8-10 of their margaritas then order something. Hopefully by this time you'll be too inebriated to know what you're eating."
5,"The first I tried this place was when my dad worked at the arena downtown.  Him and I are both obsessed with peach cobbler amd we could not find a place in AZ for a while that served good peach cobbler...since then we have found some, but in my opinion this is the best in Phoenix.  I am still searching...lol...I love peach cobbler that has a good amount of crust, but the cobbler cannot be dry or bready...it needs to be gooey and a little doughy...I do not like it when there is only fruit and then there is just some sprinkling of a crust on top....This place as the perfect amount of crust and fruit!  I love it!  It is the best with some vanilla ice cream and have it warmed up!  It is great with a little carmel sauce or a bourbon carmel sauce on top!  I know that I should be reviewing the entire restaurant but I only go here for cobbler and it is the best!  TRY IT!!"
1,"This is update to review submitted in 2011.  Unfortunately apartment management and maintenance have deteriorated with changes to onsite staff.  Pool area is never cleaned, dumpsters have trash everywhere and are disgusting, all plants are dying because they're never watered, and most distressing, downstairs neighbor keeps two pit bull dogs on patio 24 hours a day and they poop and piss on concrete which draws flies and smells horrible.  Attempts to resolve this last issue were unsuccessful.  Probably will be moving out soon.  Very disappointing."
5,"Is this real life? $3.99 6 packs and $7.99 12 packs of craft beer? My brain melted when I went down the beer aisle. This place is bananas, a total gem. The guy at the counter is always super chill too; best corner store in the hood!"
1,"It's super dirty in here, I walked in just saw the floor and walked out, management really needs to teach the workers how to clean, I saw crumbs in the table and the floor looked like it hasn't been moped in a month! So gross!"
1,"..my original review was deleted due to violating Yelp's Content Guidelines or Terms of Services.

Not sure how, or why. I think you all should know how bad the food was here, and how dirty the establishment was inside before you waste the trip. I also made a point to note that being of a specific ethnic origin does not automatically grant you a superior palate which can taste food from that origin better than the next person.

Bottom line: The kitchen was a disgusting wreck when I was able to peek back in there. The food gave me food poisoning, and was hands down the worst I've had. It is hard for me to respect a business who doesn't respect their customers enough to sweep the floor-"
1,"This is my second visit to this store. Kimberly (the woman behind the counter) is the rudest person I have ever met in retail, who does not deserve to be behind the counter of any retail counter. She is cold, un-inviting, and overall appears to hate her job by the scour look on her face.  She is useless when it comes to helping customers and overall she has a ""can't do"" attitude.  

I lodged a complaint on the corporate website and this store is privately franchised and owned.  I spoke with John the owner and apparently he must have trained Kimberly because his attitude is just as bad if not worse. He didn't show any concern for my complaint nor did he show any empathy for my experience.  He hung up on me twice in conversation. 

Kimberly followed me out to the parking lot and show aggressive signs of intimidation with my friend and I and in my opinion that was inappropriate and unprofessional. A sales person NEVER follows a customer outside. 

Avoid this store at all cost. The post office is around the corner and is much cheaper. I am fling a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  

Good luck John and Kimberly!!!"
1,"Visited this place right after checking in to the hotel right across the street for a conference. I was STARVING! A co-worker and I love Mexican food, so we decided to give this place a shot. We were greeted by a hostess, showed to our table, and not long after, the waitress came and got our drink and food order. We had to ask twice for chips and salsa. Salsa was a bit chunky...more like pico, and I don't care for chunks of tomato, so that turned me off. I ordered the chicken deep fried tacos. I really wasn't impressed. No flavor. The tortilla wasn't crispy enough. Not a good meat to veggie to tortilla ratio. Rice and beans were good though. Our flight had been delayed and it was pretty late, so when we were ready for our check, our waitress was no where to be found. I'm not sure that I'll ever try this place again if I'm ever back this way..."
5,Best Mexican food ever! The beans are amazing - just like Nana's! I love the potato and beef tacos as well as the shrimp cocktail. I used to be a Poncho's on Central die hard but this place has a bigger menu selection and it's sooo good! If you want inexpensive authenticate Mexican food then this is your place! Love the cups of sopa they give you during lunch as a free appetizer along with the chips and salsa. Closed on Monday's so keep that in mind. Enjoy!
1,"I have no hesitation in giving this review one star.  I wanted a Frosty, but left without anything.  The patron two cars in front of me apparently thought she was ordering at a fine dining establishment.  It's Wendys not a fancy steakhouse. While waiting for this person to finish ordering her lenghtly and detailed order, a bum tried to ask me for change.  I promptly told him to get the F*** out of here.  I took my own advice and did the same.  Will not be back to this location."
1,"I recently moved to Phoenix from Las Vegas. I live across from Cheesecake Factory on Camelback Rd. I was hungry one night and stopped in for a quick bite on December 4th. I've always enjoyed their pineapple Mojitos  and the menu variety . I sat at a small table in the bar area. It was literally 5 mins before I was even acknowledged (I timed it)! Then menus were haphazardly dropped on the table. I wasn't offered water and warm bread came out 5 mins later. Meanwhile, the servers were congregating, laughing and joking in the back station, which was clearly visible from my table. I finally ordered a chicken Marsala and that took another 20 mins (I also timed that), to which I jokingly replied to my server (a young, bald AfricanAmerican server with large diamond earrings) ""I thought that you forgot about me?"" His curt reply was ""It's gotta cook!""....I probably won't go back to Cheesecake Factory based on this last visit, even though it is across from where I live, even if I am craving a pineapple Mojito. I am discovering that there are many other options in close proximity to me.....You NEVER know who your customers are! I've been in the restaurant business for over 30 years in New York, Paris and Las Vegas and have moved to PHX, to live and open a restaurant here....Oh, yeah, and I happen to be one of the Top Chefs in America:-)

1,"I have never been overly impressed by Sentry but it is the neighborhood store closest to my home.  Therefore, I end up there for groceries more often than not. 

Then came yesterday:

I have been looking an issue of Time magazine.  I have tried a few places with no luck.  So rather than waste gas money, I began calling around.  I live about a mile from the Sentry store and thought I would give it a call on the way home.  The phone was answered and I simply asked: Do you carry Time Magazine?  Her response was: Maybe, yeah I think so.  Before I could ask if it was in stock, she hung up on me.  No good bye.  Nothing.  If she was busy she could have said that.  

So I go into the store to search for it, assuming it is there.  I do find it in the magazine rack and I check the head of the registers.  I hear a voice and immediately recognize the woman who answered the phone.  She had a peach colored fleece on.  She is an older woman in her 50/60's with graying hair behind the customer service register.  I pass her up because I am completely upset to see her doing nothing.  The fact that she hung up on me and I come to the store and I see her sitting on a chair doing nothing angered me.  

I continued to look for my magazine.  One of the cashiers asks if they can help me with something.  I tell her I am looking for Time Magazine.  Her response: Well, umm, what?  Never heard of it.  

Now, I could care less if they do not carry it, but thus far I have been told you might carry it by a woman who hung up on me and then a cashier who has never heard of a national magazine.  I keep looking.  I ask another cashier who might know.  After all, what if I just overlooked it?  She says she does not know.  And that is it.  

That is my whole experience trying to find a magazine.  I walked out feeling completely terrible.  I shop at the store because it is near my house.  Last night, I decided to stop shopping there.  I will drive to the belt line and go to Pick and Save or up to Sun Prairie.  I will NOT go to your store."
5,"This place is the best! Always friendly staff, super delicious salads and chicken kabobs. Would recommend to all!!!"
1,"READ THIS REVIEW..... if you are willing to do the following:
1) support a local business
2) have a knack for bitter and angry women
3) take time of work... meaning a whole day of work 
4) be on call and not do anything until they come to your home
5) be hung up on
6) PAY for crappy service...


a lady from this 7 person office calls me in reference to a service that was schedule between 1-4 pm , this was per the property manager.. However there was a miscommunication between the business and the manager all I knew was it was between 1pm to 4pm.
i was on my way to the house to take care of the issue .. Before i forget to mention this ... 
A lady calls me at 12:50 asking me how far was I from the home ... i answered give me 15 minutes (I was still thinking about the 1-4pm time slot) she then said you know this is not going to happen , the property manger this the property manager that ... this is ridiculous and you guys should've been there and went on and on and on and on ... and she was on my cars bluetooth on blast with my 11 and 9 year.... and  i said well i apologize for that i will there as soon as possible.. then she said .. no... its not going to happen ma'am not today ... this is not going to happen ma'am .. she uses the word ma'am like she was to say *insert profanity here* , then i asked how can we resolve this maybe  if we can work on rescheduling (first of all WHY am I as the consumer would be trying to make things work when she was standoffish to begin with? IDK maybe i am still hoping for world peace) ... and she was like ugh no I need to call American Home Shield and the owner I don't know this is ridiculous.. and I asked well can we get a time maybe for next week and then call us if its possible or not and she NO MA'AM I AM NOT GOING TO THAT all loud ..... and asked ... excuse me did I say something to offend you???  and here goes........SHE HUNG UP! i called back and she said YES I HUNG UP ON YOU and hung up again !

I was disappointed with the property manager and made sure he knew I felt, however Angry lady's action was uncalled for... wow ,now i know why some people pay a premium for larger companies ... since this will not be tolerated.


When i read the review from Mollie C .... why am I not surprised?

The following has been done:
1) filed an executive complaint with the BBB
2) a copy was sent to American Home Shield and the FTC , just in case this company tries to make a quick buck....and ask for the $75 deductible 
2) a letter to Mr. Little , the owner and according to the grumpy lady on the phone he was the ""technician"" he that was waiting.... 
do 

I guess if the owner of the company is performing the service .. you need to bow down to him ... its like the president of the United states is doing you a favor and exempted all taxes due for you and your family....SCORE!

this is the worst service I have received .. better yet treatment from a COMPLETE stranger."
5,"Holy Mother of God! If you share your home with a four-footed creature, this place will be your new Disneyland! The owner of Halo turned me on to this place a couple of weeks ago and I finally made my trip over. It's not your typical shopping experience, so if you are faint hearted, don't even attempt it during the warmer months!

This place wholesales to pet stores and service providers, but as they are a locally owned and family run establishment, they open up their warehouse to the general public. Basically, you get to go rummage around their warehouse, along with their workers who are pulling huge orders, and fill up your basket or cart with anything you can imagine that is pet related (except for food). I mean good lord, I didn't even know they made facial scrub products for dogs and had no clue that they had specialty shampoos for red heads, blondes, and brunettes!!!

But let's take a tour of my cart:
tennis ball squeaky bone - check
chicken jerky  - check
chicken rice balls - check
odor eliminator candles - check
happy bunny buffs - check (oh yeah these rock)
window kitty bed - check
case of greenie things - check
remote controlled citronella training collar - check
horribly embarrassing foo foo collar decoration - check

Here are few things you should know before you go:
1) There is a $25 minimum purchase (not sure if that is the same on line).
2) Every single one of their products is on their website or in their catalog and that is where you will find pricing info.
3) They have tiered pricing, so if you are buying one of an item, you will pay the highest amount. Each item has a ""bulk"" price which kicks in when you buy 3 to 12 of that item (depending on the product).
4) Prices ROCK, even the highest price is about 20% less than the big box pet stores and as much as 50% less than the boutiques. I went to look for a spray training collar (the non-shock kind) for my youngest dog and it was literally 60% less than the best price I could find anywhere else.
5) You have to put it together... if you are buying a crate or carrier, they will get it to your car, but  you have to assemble it yourself.
6) They have two full walls covered with clearance items that you will never see on line or in a catalogue.
7) This place is only open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but phone and web orders can be picked up until 5:00 p.m.
8) The warehouse is cooled by coolers and was hotter than a son of a bitch when I was there. Industrial fans be damned... nothing is going to make you cooler - but a deal is a deal. Go in the cooler months and stock up, or shop on line.  http://www.ryanspet.com/ryanspet/default.asp?

The staff is INCREDIBLY nice (especially considering that they must be rattled by the heat during the summer). As you are wandering the aisles, they make sure you know they are there to answer questions, pull box, help you find a specific item, etc.

They also have a sharpening service in their sister building, where you can get your shears spiffed up for a reasonable price.

Seriously this place is a must go for anyone that feels compelled to spoil their four-footed companions. Let's just say that I was almost crushed when I broke out the bags and I didn't have to have a good cry on the way home for spending too much!"
1,"I hate saying negative things about people or businesses because you never know what's going on in their life to cause them to be rude to you, however Lori's Grooming has permanently scarred my dog. I used to bring my cocker spaniel here frequently it was close to my house and she would always get her in last minute. My dog was 5 when I started taking her to Lori so she had been to the groomer hundreds of times and never had an issue. After about the 6th or 7th time at Loris she would start to shake uncontrollably when we would even get close to the front door. Sometimes she would even poop and pee herself obviously completely terrified. This reaction was new she had never acted like this with any groomers and still, tho not as bad, has this reaction when we go to the groomers.

I feel Lori had either been extremely aggressive to my dog or just treated her terribly, bad enough to cause her to react this way. Tho Lori was never a very pleasant woman I would have never expected her to harm my dog. Be weary of this groomer. Unfortunately there is no way to prove she did anything to my dog, if there were I would have her in jail, but you know your animal and she obviously was terrified of Lori. If you pet is like your child please watch that she is not being harmed.

I give one star because she would always get her in last minute."
1,"Bah!  Below is my outdated review.  I hate Danny's. Do not come here.  I got my oil changed and they forgot to put a plate back on the bottom of my car.  I found out when I brought my car into the dealer for a repair.  They were like, uh, do you know part of your car is missing....  my friend also had a bad experience.  Over $200 for a crappy detail job.  Don't bother.


What to say about Danny's...    It's a full service joint.  You can have your car washed, oil changed, tank filled all while relaxing in an air conditioned sitting area.  The prices are on the high side and it can be quite busy.    I'm still looking for a cheap place to get my car washed, but I do bring my car to Danny's for oil changes."
5,"The best sandwich I've had in my life was one I had at the Teeter House ... the Prosciutto, Salami and Imported Provolone sandwhich.  I was so addicted to it one summer, I walked over there maybe 3-4 times a week to order it.  It was bizzare rolling up in a RVCA tee and a pair of cargos and Reefs while the other partrons were having some kind of Royal Family flashback in their feathery headpieces and pinkys skyward.

But whatever.  I ALWAYS sat outside under their very large oak(?) trees that shade most of their front area.  This was great for some serious people watching ... mostly tourist wondering why Bianco is closed at noon, but attempting the door anyway.  They would eventually mosey over to Teeter ... good for them!

Anyhow, back to this sandwhich.  Its unbeleivable and pretty large with a side of rosemary potato salad and some fruit.  Teeter house also serves beer and wine, which was always nice.  They have a pretty good selection too.

My only complaint is that they open too late (for morning coffee -- although once i guess i looked thoroughly disappointed that they weren't open yet early on a Sunday while they were setting up and gave me a free coffee-to-go anyway!) and they close way too early.  If they serve booze, they should mos def stay open til midnight or so, especially with a haunted house for effect."
5,"She is fantastic! I came her to because my boss recomended her...it's always scary taking your wedding dress to someone...especially when you are on a very tight budget. For our wedding there were two brides so we had two dresses, double scary. She had great customer service. She was also fast...one week we did the initial fitting, the next week final touches and later that week, done, eventhough my dress had a lot of beadwork. She was also honest, if something didn't look like it fit, she would let us know and if something was not needed, she didn't suggest things to get more money out of us."
1,"You can not give zero stars on Yelp but Zero is the reality. This is a review only for our student field trip booking experience. Warning--- don't do it. This had to be the worse experience of my 15 years of teaching in the classroom and booking field trips. There was one issue after another ranging from no calls back, to rude staff, to hang ups, to transfer after transfer to answering machine, to dial tone.  ARGHHH and frustration abound. They now make all teachers wanting a Title One field trip to go to a worthless class. No exceptions even by experienced educators.  I mean really???? A class on how to learn how to go on a field trip? ""ReallyTIMES2?"" This is is a slap in the face for educators. It would take too long to explain all the problems we had but rest assured it was the worse customer service in the world trying to book our field trip. It took us three months to finally close the deal. There is absolutely no excuse for this. You would think in this economy they would be happy for our business. One phone call had me hanging up on the woman because she was so horribly rude! I will update the review after the trip, which I sure hope goes better than the entire ugly experience of booking it. We will never be going here again."
1,"Major suck.

I have been here 3 times with three separate vehicles. I think ""Hey? Why not try again?""

Every time I get my car washed here I feel like they always forget something: the very bottom of your front and rear bumpers, the water that dripped from your liftgate onto the bumper, anything on the windshield that isn't dust......


I could go on and on, but my point is that they don't seem to care, they just want their tip and you leave. I feel bad so I tip, as it's hot and I sure as hell ain't doing the job.

Go somewhere where your car actually comes out clean though."
1,"So Dallas G and I were thinking of a lunch spot.  I suggested Cibo, Matt's, or Valley Pizza, and he thought of Focaccia Fiorentina.  I thought FF sucked the first time I went there but was willing to give it another try. But when we got there ol' Dally had a ""better"" idea and suggested Athenian Express.

As we pulled in, some unacceptably angry looking woman glared at him for a reason that will presumably remain unknown to us.  (Please enjoy my multimedia Yelp.)

http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209414090

In retrospect, I think she was our guardian angel trying to scare us off.  Inside, the place looks quaintly divey.  I asked if anything was so much better than the gyro that I should get it instead, and was told that the gyro is the way to go.  Feta or no feta?  I wondered if it was an avalanche of feta or just a sprinkling.  He puts a lot on there.  Fine, no feta.  I get the potato salad with it, and an order of spanakopita--which I ordinarily love.

We sit outside.  The spanakopita arrives.  It has little cheese and is not flaky.  Tastes kinda like shit.  Served with crappy tzatziki, which I don't think is the appropriate side for spanakopita but whatevs.

http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209643122

Next, my gyro arrives.  The gyro meat is covered in three slabs of tomato and a mountain of onions.

http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209752658

As you can see, at this point I'm fearing the worst.  Look, I like onions and all, but when you leave fresh onions out in the air for too long they become veeeerrrry rowdy.  Like so rowdy that eating one would be enough to burn your mouth and render you a pariah.  So all that's left of my gyro is three slices of ""gyro meat"" and tomatoes.  And the little side cup of tzatziki that is only filled a third of the way.  The gyro meat tastes like... nothing.  I am underwhelmed.

I move on to my side of potato salad.

http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209805283

Normally mustard potato salad has a pastelish yellow hue, but this one looked like it could be seen from space.  Whatever it was, it was odorless and flavorless, so I can only assume it's some undetectable poison like polonium-123.  If I die, I leave my rapier-like wit and boundless charisma to my son, Samir.  You all can fight over the rest.

Anyway, the restaurant pretty much blew.

http://twitter.com/spirit_fingers/status/5209947387

I'm not an arsonist, it was a joke, relax.  But not as big of a joke as Athenian Express, which must have suffered a precipitous decline in quality if even Dallas G (and his notoriously low standards) ever liked it."
1,"1)  The customer service at this store is terrible.  The employees are rude, particularly Scott who works in the plant section.   
2)  The plants this past summer were infested.  I had to return two mandevillas because of aphids, and Bruce gave me a hard time about refunding me.  Last straw:  the $50 rubber plant I purchased in August came home with some time of mite infestation, I was able to treat the plant successfully, but recently noticed that the plant was ailing.  Upon close inspection, I noticed it was full of aphids.  Disgusting.  I am fortunate that my other plants, which came from different nurseries, were not infected.  Rubber plant went in garbage, and I will never waste another dollar at Bruce Company again."
1,"Went for dinner me and my 9 years old son
Order 1 adult mill and one kids mill
No drinks jest whether 
When the bill came the whiter whit next to me until I get Har payment and my son was noisy   So I didn't cake so Mach the bill
Well it was 31 dollar .....
And I also had tip 
What A rip off."
5,I just recently moved up here to Phoenix and was looking for something good to eat. I started looking through things on Yelp and found this place. it took me forever to find it and I called and the lady helped me find it. Well I definitely found it. I went and the lady working was so friendly and helped me pick out what to eat. And the found was delicious!!!!  I had the number 1. I definitely recommended it to anyone.
1,"Horrible service, whether busy or not.
Pizza is always limp, soggy or undercooked.
Baked Tuna Sandwich is bitchin'.
Pizza Cookie is ok.
Go to Scottsdale or Tempe location instead."
5,"I've been here a few times now. I can't believe I hadn't reviewed this place like, right after my second visit when I got food but I digress. 

Welcome Diner is a cute restaurant with plenty of picnic tables outdoors. They do have some indoor seating, but it looks to be quite tiny and every time I've been is in a group. This is the spot for nice, sunny days-I've only been here when it's cool outside so I can't say much about what it'll be like in the summer. The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but not so much during the day. Since you're sitting outside, it's allowed for some pretty entertaining people watching.

The brunch here is awesome! I always get super excited when I can have biscuits and gravy (since the only animal I eat is of the fish variety). You can get biscuits with mushroom gravy!! The portion I got was huge and so dang tasty. 

The drinks are awesome! Get the Hurricane..even if just for the cashier to yell ""HURRICANEEEE!"" when you order it... It's pretty fun and adds to the overall experience.

I will definitely be back to try their dinner options and grab another delicious cocktail."
5,Fantastic seafood at a very good price!
5,"I once thought I knew what luxury was. Luxury is yachts. Luxury is stretch limousines. Luxury is diamond tiaras and Rolex watches. Luxury is Bentleys and Beverly Hills; bone-in filets and ""bon appetite"". Luxury is throwing some glitter and making it rain.

I once thought luxury in its truest form was to only be attainable by the rich and the powerful - but boy was I wrong. People -- luxury IS attainable. I know this, because I recently experienced it at the Country Inn and Suites outside of Madison, WI. 

 Whether you opt for an ""inn"" or spring for a ""suite"" - you're going to love this fucking hotel. Upon entering the palatial lobby, a charming bellman presented me with my own personal luggage dolly, even though it was clear that my strapping, young body was more than adequate to carry my small, nylon duffle bag. The Sconnie at the front desk even put me up on the top floor of the resort (floor 3), which offered views of one of the most gorgeous bodies of water I had ever seen. 

The ice bucket was a nice touch. It was large, though not too large as to take up much of the expansive counter space the room provided. There was even a plastic liner for the bucket--which I scoffed at. To think, who would even consider using it in such a pristine, meticulously manicured suite? I quickly tossed it, and when I did I couldn't help but notice the luxurious mini-fridge down below. Let me tell you, there was nothing ""mini"" about this fridge. I fit an entire case of Coors Light in there, along with some Gatorade, and cheese curds to boot. It looked so cool and cozy that, at the end of the evening, I wanted to curl up and sleep in there.

Though it wasn't easy -- I refrained from sleeping in the mini-fridge. I mean, how could I sleep in there with one of the most luxurious beds I had ever seen staring me in the face? You could fit John, Kate, and the 8 on this bed. I never would, though. I'd kick them all out and keep all of the fresh pillows and down comforters to myself-- because THAT'S luxury, and Kate is mean. If it wasn't for a call of nature which I battled until my bladder nearly exploded on all of the luxurious bedding, I might STILL be laying in that fluffy wonderland of extravagance. 

Now, I've peed in some nice bathrooms... very nice bathrooms actually. Once, I came across a bathroom SO nice, I couldn't pee in there. I held it, and peed in my less fortunate bathroom at home-- but this bathroom? This bathroom was so luxurious; I HAD to pee in it. I couldn't unzip my fly fast enough (literally, I peed a little in my pants). Thankfully there was a cornucopia of fine soaps and lotions at my disposal. I would bet that royalty uses these same soaps - they just had that royal smell about them. When I was done drying my hands, I squirted a little more of that soap on them and didn't even wash it off.

Summary: In hindsight, this is really only a place you want to stay at if you're celebrating something really special-- a honeymoon, for instance, or a significant wedding anniversary. I would've stayed someplace else had I known the Country Inn and Suites was so luxurious. Now, back at my home, I fear I may never taste that royal tang again. Enjoy your stay here; cherish it. I know I sure did."
5,"Fantastic service, freindly people and very high quality products. Look for their ads in the State Journal and Today's Deals at madison.com and you will see some amazing savings and pricing."
5,"This is my Go-To Spot for lunch. The food is always great, service even better and the prices just perfect.  

I usually get the mediterranean  (sp?) tuna pita . it's a great soft pita filled with tuna, onions, capers and tomatoes. The tuna's mixed in with this oil and vinegar mixture, totally awesome! I sometimes will get the Greuben, which is a grlled reuben made with turkey and their home made slaw with feta!  My all time fave meal there is the Power Protein Plate, which is grilled chicken served with caramelized onions and a huge heap of the slaw!

They also have great sides like killer potato salad, pasta salad and the aforementioned slaw. If you're looking for a great pretty healthy spot to get lunch, check it out!"
1,Do not rent here. Staff in the front office is horribly rude. They don't care about their residents at all.
5,"This hotel is a great place to stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the continental breakfast was just what we needed to get a quick start to our day.

The hotel has a small outdoor pool, a gym, and the rooms are nice. I wish it had a dining area/bar, but it didn't, and it wasn't a big deal to us. It's located within walking distance to the ball park, museums, and restaurants, which was nice, and is only a quick drive to spring training sites for MLB clubs, the Zoo, and other attractions. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here, and had no complaints about the hotel at all. When I am back in the area, I will definitely consider staying here again."
5,"Great little yogurt place.  At first I wasn't sure about not being self-serve, but it actually worked so that I wouldn't serve myself too much and wind up throwing yogurt away.  I like how they layer toppings for you and are willing to mix and match."
1,"dee-skusting!  ate here once, the food was horrible, portions were microscopic.

try it if you don't believe.

don't tell me i didn't warn you

save your hard earned cash for another place and time"
1,"Very disappointed and frustrated after leaving this nail salon. Like most, I don't have a lot of time to spend on getting a pedicure so when I can carve out time I'm thrilled to get one done. I walked in with a friend, was directed to chairs for our pedis, and the gal working proceeded to work on my friend's toes while I sat without even water in the tub. waited and waited while a few ladies with appts showed up. finally after my friend was done she told me I had another 30 mins to wait. No apologies, no explanation... very frustrated and was incredibly disappointed with this rude and inconsiderate service. Obviously I left without a pedi as I didn't want to pay them a dime for anything."
5,"Great food, great service, great atmosphere! We had the veggie burger and the Welcome Burger. Both were amazing! The fried avocado was out of this world. 

We will definitely be going back. I highly recommend this unique little gem in Downtown Phoenix."
5,"I really do keep meaning to go for free line dance lessons.  Good prices, no cover, excellent happy hour, lots of crowd variety.  Fun place to meet up with my friends!"
5,I eat here regularily because it is consistently good.  Very large menu which makes it tough to choose but never disappointed!
1,"Heading to catch a flick at The Arizona Center. Decided to checked out Mi Amigo's. To start with, it took about 5 minutes before anyone bother to talk to us. Once we did get to order, we opted to share the tortilla soup and the chicken fajitas. The tortilla soup was really bad. It tasted like a mix of chili powder and salt. We ended up sending it back. The chicken fajitas were actually ok, but not great. 

The real downer was the service. Waitstaff appeared to be fairly apathetic about the place. Limited interested in actually taking our order, bringing out food, etc..

Overall, there are much better choices. You should look elsewhere if you are hungry for Mexican food."
1,"I should have kept driving when we pulled in and there's paramedics with a huge Fire Engine in front of the restaurant with gobs of odd looking people standing around the commotion.  I wanted to look at the food before agreeing to sit down and at first glance it looked pretty decent compared to other chinese buffets I've been to.  

But if I can offer one piece of advice, dont go there on Fridays for lunch....apparently every Friday morning they host the local nut house for a meal.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice gesture but after being in the middle of two pretty intense verbal altercations that quickly turned violent, I knew this was going to be one of those experiences that I would write about on Yelp!  There were at least 50 people from the rehab center inside the restaurant trying to get food from the substandard buffet.  I should have also noticed something was ""up"" when I saw all the rehab vans parked in the parking lot.  But trying to keep an open mind, we continued to sit down and tried to eat our meal.  There were a lot of people shouting at each other and arguing, lots of mentally ill people glaring at us almost in an antagonistic manner.  

Besides all that, the food was not super hot and was pretty gross and NOT cheap!  I would NOT recommend this place for it's food and especially not on Fridays if you don't want to get assaulted by a local mental patient."
1,"I called this auto shop to see if they had a part and could help install it and the gentleman on the phone said sure, if they weren't busy.  I made it clear that I would pay for the assistance.  When I got there, I dealt with another gentleman who laughed at me when I asked if they could help me install the part.  If anyone could recommend a female friendly auto place, please pass the suggestion along.  I did not feel like I was helped here at all."
5,"I'm in Boston and had a gift basket and flowers sent to my GF's Madison hotel. I asked Felly's to replace the generic card that typically accompanies flowers with my handwritten card, which I'd overnighted to them. 

Not only did they handle my request with grace, they also stylishly put the card inside the wrapped basket itself and put up with my phone calls asking if everything was going according to plan.  They also added the flowers as a last-minute request and didn't overcharge me for it . . . overall great people to work with!!"
5,"When I want to feel REALLY white, I just roll on down to Ranch Market to confirm my suspicions that, yes, I am in fact not as Hispanic as I think I am.  This store is what Food City WISHES it was!  It takes the best of Mexican specialty stores and eateries and combines it all under one roof.  Shoppers here are mostly Hispanic with a few adventurous gringos thrown in here and there.  But workers there are friendly and know English - some better than others.

Holy crap!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place.  I only go here ALL the time for cheap delicious down-home Mexican food, cheap produce, and Spanish rice like Grandma used to make.  I've been going to Ranch Market for about 10 years at their stores in Bakersfield -- where they first started.  I used to make fun of my mom for going to lunch here.  Heh, look who's laughing now.  I'm addicted!

The food here is no-frills authentic and seats inside are picnic bench style.  It's not uppity Mexican fare like Barrio Cafe, but it's not Filiberto's diarrhea fare either.  Everything from chile colorado, chile verde, calabasitas, sopes, mole,  tortas, carnitas, chicharrones, tamales, ceviche.  You name it, they have it.   And that's just in the deli.  They have a panaderia with all kinds of cakes, flans and pandulce (sweet bread).  I LOOOVE pandulce.  They even have a jugeria (juice bar) tortilleria, and a counter for fresh cheeses and cremas. 

And the produce?  Cheap and abundant.  I got some bananas and tomatoes just a little over one dollar.  Don't think about getting any organic veggies here.  This isn't the place.  This is also not the place for low-fat shopping either.  But it is so many other great things that the other stores aren't.

Best of all is the atmosphere inside - it is REALLY festive - like you're at Tia and Tio's fiesta.  Mariachis and bands abound here during the weekend.   Dang!!   Fry's, Safeway, Basha's - take note, por favor.  You're on notice."
5,"A classic old brick building, within a stone's throw of the basketball game, and a home run away from Chase Field. Filled with rock memorabilia, sports memorabilia, HD TVs and five giant projection screens! Top this off with giant portions of good old fashioned man food. Parking, albeit pay, in the back."
5,"Love this place, in fact got married there in 1999.  It is one of the most extensive collections of Native American artifacts and history that I know of.  Goregeous galleries.  My one suggestion would be to offer maps of the museum, can get kind of confusing.  If you have very young ones I wouldn't take them, this is more in line of an art museum."
5,"This place absolutely lives up to the reviews. Ka is great to work with, congenial and does an excellent job with his work. He takes his time, listens to suggestions, and gives a clean custom cut.

It's also worth noting that he does great work with Asian hair. I've not found anyone else in town who does as satisfactory a job.

Nothing fancy here, just a very good cut at a reasonable price (20 with tip last time I went)"
5,"I've been frequenting Dexter's quite often over the past few months (to the tune of around twice per week) and am happy to report that every visit has been absolutely STELLAR.

There's the obviously excellent beer selection - it's constantly rotating, and it always tastes fresh and wonderful.  The staff really know their beer - if you ever have a question, don't hesitate to ask because they will offer a sample, suggestions, and plenty of information.

The food has been incredible with every visit.  Sure bets: the hummus platter (wow, that IPA hummus is unreal), the waffle fries, any of the burgers, most of the specials, and of course, the fish fry.

I've had several burgers (The Abbey (with tomato garlic sauce), the Defibrillator (onions, ham, bacon, egg, cheese), and the Patty Melt) - each was delicious, and they cook them exactly to order.

I've had the Santa Fe Chicken salad - wow, those roasted veggies are great.  The soups have also been excellent - I recently had the spicy vegetable and the chili; the chili features a spice that slowly crescendos - by the end of the cup, you're feeling a little of that capsaicin love.

I've had several specials, including a turkey melt and a loaded ham and cheese.

And of course, I've had the fish fry several more times and am PLEASED to report that it remains excellent.  The hearty, perfectly applied batter and the flaky fresh cod is among Madison's best.  I will be updating my fish fry review with new pictures and details in the near future.

Service has markedly improved - the staff is fast, friendly, and as mentioned, super helpful.  I really enjoy their company - it's great to drop by and sit at the bar or to grab a table and chill for a while.

UPDATE: Dexters = MAJOR WIN

Food = 4.75 stars.  Really great, really consistent
Service = 4.75 stars. Fast, helpful, attentive
Value = 4.5 stars. Quality is there, so the prices are worth it
MISC = 5 stars.  Great vibe, great crew, good jukebox - love it


Summary: 
I now live about 25 miles from Dexter's, and I don't hesitate to make the drive.  If someone asks, ""feel like grabbing a bite tonight?"" I'm always happy to recommend Dexter's, even if it means a 30+ minute ride.  It's that good."
1,"I'm basing my review over some instances that I've had to go to their ER.

1. In VERY bad motorcycle accident where I broke my left leg, pelvis and dislocated my toe. Also had very deep road rash.

2. Two instances of painful kidney stones.

For # 1, I was transported via ambulence to the nearest hospital which meant by default, I HAD to go there as the accident happened on I-10 tunnel. I found the staff to be very gruff (in general) and the surgeon was even worse. Do not recall his last name, but his first name was ""Michael"". He basically told me to ""try harder"" when I would try to get up and stand by my bed. I kept telling him I was dizzy and felt like I had to faint. Turns out, I lost a lot of blood during the accident and was needing a transfusion. After I get 2 bags of blood, I'm good to go again! My point being, these asshole doctors really do need to LISTEN to their patients! I also had a horrid night RN come in and was a little rough and bossy to check my vitals during my week stay. How are you gonna feel if someone pokes your damn arm in the middle of deep rest in the night? No ""excuse me"" or anything! I remedied that be asking the Charge Nurse to never send her my way again.I also had my shoes stolen from my room. Not cool.

As for #2, I had to wait a LONG time to even be examined. I was literally in so much pain that I couldn't even sit down. For those of you who don't know how kidney stones feel, just imagine a damned cactus being shoved up your urethra. I'm not kidding. I was there pacing back and forth without any help. After pacing around and begging for something to kill the pain, the RN gave me something and had me pee through what looked like a vegetable strainer. Ughhhh."
5,"Madison's great historic small concert venue.  Lot's of great bands play here.  I saw Weezer on their Pinkerton Tour with Nerf Herder (remember them? The Van Halen Song? Yes, I'm that old)."
1,"Boy, if I checked in here, it was a mistake.  I'm not even sure you could pay me to go to Applebees."
1,"Bad food and terrible service.  Went here during restaurant week with a large group of friends and everyone was disappointed.  The service was slow and disrespectful and I'm not sure I would have fed my rubber steak to the dog.  I'm not one to go out of my way to write a bad review unless the place really deserves it, and sadly this ""steakhouse"" certainly does due to the quality of food, price and service. Don't do it, try City Hall."
5,"Capital is my go to Friday night spot!

I love visiting Capital Brewery anytime of year. The beer garden is a great place to enjoy a cold brew, sunshine and live music in the summer time. In the winter the bier stube is cozy and fun.

The staff is awesome and the beer is delicious. Plus you can bring your own snacks!"
1,"In response to the business owner's response, I'm not really buying it.  Being honest about the diagnosis of a car is only half the battle.  Being honest about pricing is just as important.  And these guys totally failed.

Implying that technicians who charge less than them are somehow lower quality is just bullshit, plain and simple.

They wanted to charge us more than $600 to put on new brake rotors and pads.  Retail for those parts?  About $150.  Hours it takes to swap them out?  One, or two, at the most.

Naturally, when I called them and sounded like I actually knew what I was talking about, they knocked $150 off the price they offered my wife.  Still not good enough.  It was $300 cheaper to tow our car all the way to our trusted Mesa mechanic and have him do the work.

Oh, and the inspection we used a Groupon for?  They charged us for services that i later found out were supposed to be part of the Groupon.  Going to call them today to try and get a refund for that $30 (?!)  tire rotation.

Hate to rag on a local business, but the only way this could've gone worse would've been if they straight up lied about problems with the car."
1,"So sick of WAITING while tables sit empty & the ""cutsie"" little greeter girls act like they are working. No idea of organization or time management. Used to love this one but not anymore.  After waiting, kids meals came when we were done eating and they were stone cold!  The one manager is very condescending & could care less.  Could be a major reason this Applebee's is going downhill.  I'll be happy to drive to north Scottsdale or even Elliot. They both have more responsible employees & managers that care."
5,"so two gringos walk into a mexican taco shop next to a mexican bus station....

badump bump.


OMG!! wtf have i been missing here. i got a carne asada burro and a soft chicken taco...

taco was awesome. the corn tortilla was soft, supple and tasted awesome. piled high with lettuce some sliced radish and i squeezed some lemon ontop. i murdered this taco. execution style. imagine finding a duffle bag full of heads in Juarez...well this taco belonged to one of those heads..understand?

the burro was very tasty. the meat seasoned well and only two bites did i find some grisly bits. the carne asada was rolled up with some diced tomatoes and a cup of pico on the side. 

i kinda prefer my CA Burrito with a heap of Guacamole like how FilliB's makes them. but this was really tasty and i will order it again...after i check out the other items on the menu of course. 

you will now find me here every saturday morning. 
the tacos at Tacos De Juarez will soon refer to me as the Chalupacabre."
5,Consistently the BEST Thai food in Phoenix!
5,"This place rocks!!!  A real deal deli with awesome employees.  My only complaint is that they removed the sign that read "" Please order cheese"" .   I work near by and eat here often and will be a customer for a long time."
5,"Came here to split the ""Adam Richman's"" Loaded Big Unit, fat 22inch sausage on a french baguette smothered in chili, jalapeno, cheese, onions, tomatoes, bacon (although mine wasn't smothered in bacon :(). with a side of THE BEST seasoned fries I've ever had. So the unit had a lot of flavors but it wasn't too hot, but it was still great and I can finally say I tried it.

Also got a side of fried zucchini which was amazing as well, the marinara sauce it came with was really wet though, but the ranch the provided was good enough for me. I probably don't need to come in again for the loaded unit, but what I saw other people ordering made my mouth water, everything looks delicious! Service was great, nothing bad about this place at all. Came when there wasn't a sports game so it wasn't crowded :). Would come back just for the seasoned fries.. mmmmmmm."
1,"Stay far away from this company. You will waste countless hours on endless paperwork, forms, tests and still never get a straight answer about being able to go out and cover shifts. Been on the registry 5 weeks and not one shift. They use several different phone numbers from the west coast and southwest region and seem to pride themselves on it. The number you dial might be long distance, but the person you are talking to is probably sitting right inside the Phoenix Office. Also, their office is no longer on 44th st. It is on 30th st and Camelback."
5,Consistently a perfect carwash.  But their complete detail? Best in Phoenix hands down.  You will not recognize your car when you get it back.  It is like having the same car the day you picked it up from the showroom.  Fantastic staff and business!
5,"I went here for frys free weekend yay thanks frys and thanks to laura for telling me about it! I love this place best museum ever. I'm from San Francisco and I'd say this museum is a mix of the exploratorium and the academy of science. Place is amazing I'm for sure bringing my little brother here not so little brother that is he's 21! The place is soo boob.com!! I'm a nursing major and the found the anatomy and brain department amazing. I spent like 615644 hours there. The exhibits were so cool my favorites were this thing that slides over the body and does a scan over the body showing the parts letting you click on the screen while you glide the x-ray panel. Breath taking, I also loved the heart beat drums that went with your pulse, the digestive tract, and the surgery done on a manikin with a moving slideshow.  I love this place!! Will be back def. an Arizona must see and gem! At an affordable 12 or 14."
1,"Change your name. I went to cheese 'n stuff to buy cheese and the choices were laughable. It's not even a cheese shop. If your interested in purchasing cheese go to Duck & Decanter, Wedge and Bottle, or AJ's."
1,Worst pharmacy service ever! Messed up my prescription several times this year already.
5,"What can I say.  They are honest mechanics I know it is a rarity!!!  I have had my car served numerous times from them.  Every time they have been upfront and honest about what needs to be fixed immediately and what can wait to be fixed.  What is also cool is that they will drop you off home and pick you up once your vehicle is ready!!  If you do drop off enough money on your repairs they do have your vehicle washed and cleaned for free.  Which is also cool is that they don't nickel and dime you to death.  For small things like broken light bulbs they replaced them for just the cost of the bulb.

I would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs a repair."
5,"If you avoid the chain restaurants in downtown Phoenix, you won't have a bad meal.  Welcome Diner is no exception.  The burgers are amazing, and they have great cocktails to boot.  I really wish I could get food like this in my hometown."
1,"This is legit, I ordered combo #2 at 2:45 pm 3-1-14 and at 3:40 pm I had to walk to the counter and ask how much longer my food was going to be, the reply was 5 minutes there is one order ahead of you.
NO ""i am sorry for the wait, let me see whats taking so long."" Nothing.
I replied with you have three minutes or I want a refund. Well 5 goes by, Ok I want a refund. It took about another 5 minutes for him to get permission from his ""manager"" whom may or may not have even graduated high school. At this point I have been robbed 1 hour of my life, with no apologizes, with no interaction with management, or any  sense of customer service.  
There would be a zero star here if i had the option. Absolutely yummy food, when properly serviced. 
I mean their was not one single resemblance of an adult in this establishment. Its like they all got high in the back and had no sense of time, or surroundings. I understand if you have a few new people that you are training. But WTF....
Oh and on the way out some one told me calm down...Me calm down you robbed my of an hour of my life, made me hungrier than what i was, and told me to calm down. That is not how you deescalate a situation. 
Never again Honey bears will I treat you to my hard earned money. And frankly the gentleman before me should have been more furious than me, he called in his order and sandwich with whatever side, you handed him a bag with a side of sauce, no apologizes for him or any of your other LOYAL customers. Dam I am MAD.
                                    Thanks for nothing, 
                                                       Augustina AKA ROBBED"
5,"Affordable, fast, and yummy! 

Loved their Deluxe burger and chocolate frozen custard! 
Choco frozen custard was soo smooth and creamy--you won't be able to look at ice cream the same! 

p.s. their cheese curds are pretty good too!"
1,"Wow! So I work at a prison and I've had inmate meals occasionally, so there is a certain standard of food and taste that I have developed. It's really not that hard to please me with food, especially after having prison food but Sam's cafe really questioned whether or not I was an inmate that night. 

I ordered one of their specials, which was the pork enchiladas. When I got the tray, I initially thought they had mistaken the dish for a three rolled tacos, with mole-like sauce? First I had to decipher if it was fried, which was later confirmed. Then the sauce on top was definitely something that you cannot label. It had a sweet, mole, yet bitter taste, with sour cream that was light and fluffy and made it look like whip cream. I know . . . strange you say? The pork was dried out and even the two of us could not finish this one meal that was split. The beans tasted hallow, if that's even possible and the rice was extra dry. 

I am sorry to give this such a harsh review, but it's the truth and sometimes the truth hurts. I have to say they do have great margaritas and the best part was the complimentary white chocolate, pecan thing they gave at the end. Sorry Sam's but this will be my first and last time."
1,"I was so excited to try the pupusas after reading the reviews, but all the hype didn't reflect my experience.....located in a bright blue building, it was very unassuming....we entered through the back into a dimly lit, but very clean dining area.  The menu sounded good and had photos of everything to make it easy to choose.  my daughter and We ordered the Plato Tipico to get an idea of what they had to offer.   The tamale smelled and tasted of funky fish (I think it was actually pork and potato) with under cooked masa, there were beef empanadas, deep fried hard things that I think were potato and the bean and cheese pupusas...everything tasted of the oil it was cooked in and was very bland.  The cabbage slaw accompaniment was of no help in adding flavor.  I also had the horchata which was very good.  We tried ordering a dessert, however after taking our order, the server came back several minutes later to tell us they were out so we ordered something else only to be told later they were out of that too.  Finally we ordered the pork, bean and cheese pupusas to give one more try...it was very cheesey but bland with an odd meat taste.  Overall a very disappointing experience."
1,"I used to frequent this location - I think I'm pretty much done.

I guess now that the illegals who actually took pride in their work and had a spring in their step are gone, it truly is ""bottom of the barrel"" employment.

Look, I have tattoos. I date men with tattoos and piercings. Some of the people I love the most in this world have significant alterations. However - creepy dude with the craptastic jailhouse tattoos covering a good portion of his face as one of the first employees I interact with? No thanks.

Everyone looking miserable, as though they hate what they're doing and move at snail's pace to do it? No thanks.

And I've seen the sign for years that there's an upcharge for ""large"" vehicles. And when I had the Infinity QX4 for many years, I was never charged. (I figured it was for Suburbans and Expeditions and the like.) Well, I now have a Nissan Rogue. Which is smaller than my QX4 was. And l was charged for the oversize vehicle.

Mediocre at best wash done by creepy people who take no pride in the job they do that I get overcharged for?

No thanks! I'm done."
5,"Done a service repair for a broken Sub.. FAST TURNAROUND! Crazy! I called them 3 days, and they`re done and the sub is ready to go! NICE!"
1,"Ate here once with a buy one, get one coupon. I won't be heading back. Go to Los Gemelos off of State St instead."
1,"This location is a total war zone and no one knows what they are doing. Its almost like a Home depot in Mexico City... if there is such a thing. You have to take a number in the paint department... almost like a deli in New York, to get any service. And also, my brother was trying to fix an aquarium crack and the dude recommended LIQUID NAILS??? Literally, I'm standing next to the guy about to crack up. Carpenters use that like caulk to hang crown moldings or whatever. Good grief. And at the checkout, some crackhead sprinted right past us with some electrical parts or hardware and bolted right out the front door. Noone did anything. Its basically a free-for-all and I dont even know why we bothered to pay. As a plus, they do have like 100 day-laborers chilling in the parking lot, if you need help with anything and dont mind hiring Mexican felons, I suppose."
1,"I've been here before but this last time I went sucked. Why you may ask?It was the waiter being rude, ignoring me, & food was cold. Plus he kept looking at me every time he passed by our table. Not checking me out or flirting but ugly looks. He's lucky I didn't have a little walk with him outside the ihop for disrespecting me. Lucky for him I was with my sister."
5,"Went here tonight based on Yelp reviews!

What a great find! I drove by this place on my way to work for a YEAR and never thought to stop in. At a glance, it doesn't seem like much. Nestled(snugly) between two other buildings you can almost miss it. 

I'm so glad we stopped in! It has that true BBQ joint atmosphere- checkered cloth tables(each complete with it's own roll of paper towels), wood paneling, and Southern blues playing overhead. You order at the counter off of a big overhead wood sign, and they bring piles of saucy goodness to your table. This place is littered with awards for their barbecue. I guess the owner travels and competes(and a lot of times, wins) at national cook-offs.

I got the 1/3 slab rib and beef brisket combo. The ribs were super yummy. Flavor-full, but not too smokey. The brisket was nice too, not too fatty. I would say that the house sauce has that vinegar-like tang. It's sweet and spicy and tart all at the same time. Nice. 

My saucy side dish(aka boyfriend) ordered the turkey, which we both thought was good...but nothing amazing. The sides were really tasty too. The beans were delish, and the sugar-buns(read: fried dough dusted with confectioners' sugar) weren't too bad either.

We both left with tingling tongues, full bellies, and smiles on our faces.

* just a note--parking in the ""lot"" is super sparse and hard to navigate in and out of...the only drawback!"
1,"Havana Cafe refused my business today when I walked into their establishment wearing a trendy bluish, turquoise singlet. Apparently, this wannabe 4-star ""cafe"", that resides in a plaza for God's sakes has a clothing rule that says men have to wear sleeves, but women do not. I challenged, Keith, the waiter/proprietor, that my date was also wearing a similar sleeveless top and he proceeded to tell me that men are not allowed to wear sleeveless tops, and that if I were to eat there I would have to wear one of his awful red Hawaiian print polos with bamboo images on it that was two sizes too big! WTF?! So you'd rather offend me and require me to wear some crap Hawaiian shirt that I'm swimming in?! Mind you, it's 113 degrees out! In what world is this more ""appropriate attire"" than my tank and not outright sexual discrimination? For those of you who think this is a joke, it ACTUALLY HAPPENED!"
5,The very definition of a Wisconsin bar.  Good food and they make one of the best old fashioneds I've ever had.  I wish they were open on Sundays too.
1,"A few months ago I wrote a very positive review of this place.  Starting about in September, however, something very odd and unpleasant happened to Cheuvront.  The lunch service became slow, to the point where I thought I'd been forgotten.  Worse, the food started to change in unpleasant ways.  Gone were the good ingredients and subtle flavorings.  Suddenly everything was layered on in huge blobs and weighted down with unnecessary spices.

Specifically, I'm talking about the lunch pizzas I had for lunch at Cheuvront so many times before.  Last time I went, a few weeks ago, I suddenly noticed that they used nearly four times the cheese necessary.  Today, there was four times the cheese, at least two or three times the sauce, along with chunks of nearly raw garlic.

Worse, the cheese on my pizza was cool and congealed, showing that it had been sitting around for a while before the wait staff deigned to bring it to me.

I was embarrassed to have suggested to a colleague that we eat at Cheuvront today.  I don't know what happened to this restaurant, but at least the lunch service is a total loss."
5,"I heart you, Best Western Madison.

Except for the fact that they failed to pick me up from the airport due to the slightly snowy condition, they delivered everything I looked for in a quality hotel. After having traveled to 4 different business sites across the state in a span of a month, this is by far my favorite on the list of hotels that I stayed at. Why?

1) Excellent customer service by the front desk
2) Excellent transportation service (I got a ride within 5 mins most of the time)
3) Yummy HOT breakfast
4) Quiet and clean room. I wasn't looking for a posh deco at this place, so my grading's only based on business--not romantic--needs. 

Overall, I absolutely adored this hotel and would stay there again for my next visit."
1,"The service at this location is slow, the prices are outrageous, the food is totally sub-par, the drinks are always made super duper weak, and they close really early. I don't suggest coming here for a good time. The servers are nice, but I would suggest going to a more delicious location."
1,"Office Max Sucks-7th ave+Camelback rd.. They now have a Ink Toner machine behind the counter to compete with Cartridge World so you can refill your printer ink for less then what hp wants (which is too much). Don't ever use this service. 3 x I have been in there to replace the cartridge after printing maybe 6-7 copies. Called the Manager (Shane) he said they never have any issues with the machine (maybe about 5% come back). He said I must be one of these 5%. Plus 1/2 the time you go in there it seems like nobody works there. It's worst then Home Depot where they scramble like cock roaches when they see a customer walking down the isle.
Head my advice and use Cartridge World if your looking for toner refills."
1,"""Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me"".  (Just because George W. Bush couldn't get the saying right, doesn't mean I can't.)

A few months ago, I yelped about the poor service I got at Oregano's on Camelback, all because I wanted extra sauce both on my deep dish pizza and on the side.  The counte-rgal charged me $15 for a cup of sauce.  Not acceptable.  

After I yelped, I was immediately contacted by Oregano's customer service and they assured me this was not part of their policy.  She sent me gift certificates.  Further, she intimated that a management change had occurred.  Well, last night, I was AGAIN being over-charged for sauce -- BY THE VERY SAME MANAGER!!.

According to Ron, the manager, a 3 oz cup of marinara is $.99.  The cup I pointed to was a ten ounce cup.  So, to fill that would be ""about"" $3, right?  WRONG.  But how Ron gets to $10 or $15 for a cup of sauce is beyond me...and it's certainly beyond Ron's mathematical skills.

When he offered to charge me a certain amount for the sauce, I said, ""No, make it something, a formula, something to rely on in the future"".  

""YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE"", he said, making me feel 'extra special' in a not-so-nice sort of way.  Even if that is true, why berate the customer?  Isn't Ron's job to make feel special...in a positive way?  Not everyone likes the same thing....

So, he knew I was the one who had complained earlier.  He must know that Oregano's customer service thought enough of my complaint to contact me to ""make it right"", but that didn't matter.  Again, he made me feel as though I interrupted his day.  Of course, as a customer, I think I'm the very PURPOSE of his day...me and my $25 for a pizza pie.

AND HOSPITALITY?  It's called the ""hospitality"" business, right?  How was Ron, in any way, ""hospitable""?  Answer: he was not.  What a crappy ambassador he is for Oregano's.

Fool me twice, shame on me.  Even on its best day, the food isn't good enough for me to have to do a $15 battle for an extra 10 oz of sauce.  Sheesh!"
5,"There aren't a ton of restaurants and are ABSOLUTELY PHENOMINAL.  This is one and, dare I say, is the best mexican food in AZ.

I've written a fair amount of reviews and this one is likely to sound gushy enough to make my wife jealous.

Their chips are made fresh.  Not made fresh that day.  MADE FRESH FOR YOU, right when you order them.  They charge $1 for a very large basket.  Salsa is free.

The only thing I am not a fan of there is their red salsa, but thier green is so damn good and so damn hot.  I pay, but its worth it.

Ok, now the beans. Oh my God!  They are so creamy and perfect.  I highly suggest you order a side to go along with your chips.  I live a solid 30 miles from this place and will drive here JUST for the beans.  My wife loves beans so much.  Its almost unnatural.  She could seriously sit down with a plate of beans, thats it, and be happy.

She get absoluely giddy when she knows we are gonig here.

Rellenos.  Oh my God AGAIN.  I can't even describe how wonderful they are.  They really are unlike any other restaurant's I've ever had.  First off, they are huge. Secondly they use a batter that fries up so light and puffy.  So you have this slightly crisy, kinda fluffy exterior surrounding strips of relleno pepper with the most luscious, ooey gooey cheese in the center.  I dump a ton of their green salsa on top and just go to town.  All you'll here from me are moans and sighs or delight once it is put in front of me until I'm done.  They actually continue a god 30 minutes after I leave as I replay the feast in my mind.  WOW

The chicken enchiladas are perfection, the machaca is oh so good, tacos are cripsy goodness.

Here's my order...  Chips with green salsa and a side of beans while I wait for my a la cart cheese relleno and either a chicken enchilada with green sauce (not salsa) or a machaca taco.  Depends on what mood I'm in.

If I eat the whole thing for lunch.  I don't eat dinner.

There are only a couple places that really deliver every time like Rosita's does.

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

DAMN I LOVE THIS PLACE!!"
5,"We love the Beach House.  We come here often.  Food is always good.  Drinks are made by some really awesome people!  Specials are always worth a look. Weekend breakfasts are very popular, so come early.  Try the walleye/eggs.  Or the crab/eggs benedict.  Very very good!!"
1,"DON'T DO IT! They hardly speak English, and I felt an icy discomfort upon entering. They had no interest in talking to any of their clients. I needed a haircut badly so when one of the barbers became available I told him I wanted a haircut exactly like the guy he just finished with, and even with one of his buddies translating he obviously still did not get it, since I had to keep telling him shorter. The haircut was expensive for a barber shop and not good. Find someplace else!"
5,Oh how I love thee. I am going to miss this place. I used to work around the corner and frequent this spot at least 2-3 times per month. I've never had a bad wrap and the rice bowls are good too! The Senorita No Meata is one of my favorites and I love the chips and salsa... it tends to be my side of choice. The parking situation is dumb... don't go at noon. Trust me. If you can carpool that's even better.
5,"What a treasure to have in this town!

Plenty of hands-on exhibits for kids of all ages. There are even live demonstrations involving flour sifters and blowtorches.

I defy any kid to be bored when flour sifters and blowtorches are on-hand.

The entrance fee seems a bit pricey, but it's an honest 2 hours of entertainment, at least. They validate parking which is free for the first hour."
1,Enough is enough. We had our third appointment for our pup at 3pm on sat which was originally arranged on fri. They asked us if we can change the date. It was not a big deal until they stood us up. We were at the doorstep for 15 mins. Nobody was there. No phone call or a notice to inform us. And we were not the only client waiting outside. It was not cool outside in June. Bad business!!
1,"There really isn't much I like about Michael's to begin with - I especially dislike them for using my name and putting on such an inferior showing - but this location was a particular disaster.  Clean up your aisles for goodness sake, I feel claustrophobic with all the crap hanging around - its like the clothing section at K-Mart, but possibly worse."
1,when we got there we ask for a couple minutes to decide on food and beverages...after the server had not come back for 25 mins we left. Your food is not that great so customer service should be where you shine..just a tip. I will never return to this location.
1,"In a world where money buys you food--why would you come here and buy cardboard?  

Pizza Hut in general has gone downhill so far, it's not even funny.  I remember when I was a kid in the early 80's, Pizza Hut was awesome.  Now, it's all horrible."
5,"This place is awesome. Stop reading this- and just got eat here.

The salsa can be spicy- sometimes mild. 
The beans are perfect. 
The enchiladas have great flavor, but aren't spicy. The tacos have been really good. Just like when I was a kid with potatoes in them:) 

The michaladas are the best. 

Im coming Sunday to eat muendo. 

The service is great too. 

It reminds me of southern arizona/ before all the gringos/""snow birds"" got there..(Douglas, Aqua prieta) 

Seriously stop reading this and eat here. NOW! And take me with you!"
1,"We order 2 plates chilly chicken, but it is so hard to find chicken in it.  They cooked it with 75% of onions,  capsicum and 25% of chicken.  They should change dish name, it should be ""chilly capsicum"" instead of ""chilly chicken"".  Worst dish!!! 

Don't ever order chilly chicken here."
5,Mary Beth from the museum contacted me this morning after reading this review in an attempt to make my experience better. I was most impressed by the call. I will update my review after we take the trip. I appreciated the reach out.
5,Great price. Great family atmosphere. I will always choose to go here instead some chain for breakfast.
1,"We arrived at Wild Thaiger on a Friday night at 5:45. The restaurant was busy but there were 3 empty tables and one group of 3 before us that was waiting in the outside patio area. The hostess was nowhere to be seen. About 5 minutes later, she shows up and takes down our names and tells us it will be about 10 minutes for a table for two. We're fine with that so we agree to wait inside the restaurant as it was pretty cold outside. Ten minutes pass. The group of 3 before us is still waiting and the 3 empty tables are still empty. In the meantime, about 5 other groups of people have come in after us and put their names down for tables. The hostess disappears again at 6pm. I noticed this because I looked at my phone and the 10 minute wait was now 15 and the group before us still had not been seated. About 5 minutes later, the hostess comes back to seat the group of 3 and disappears again. Two couples come into the the restaurant and after waiting 5 minutes at the hostess station, one of the couples walks to the back, hoping to get someone's attention so they  can put their name down for a table. We watched them stand there for 5 minutes and then walk out of the restaurant. 6:15. No sign of the hostess. Other people have arrived and walked out as well. We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say ""Excuse me, miss?"" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be. Most of the people who were in the restaurant when we arrived are now finishing their meals. It's 6:25 and the hostess has been away from her station for 25 minutes. Our 10 minute wait was 40 standing up without so much as an apology or offer of water or a drink while we waited. We decided to leave and as we walked out, wished the 6 groups of people behind us ""good luck"". Maybe they'd get one of the still empty tables. 

The front of the house is EVERYTHING in the restaurant world. That girl probably just cost the restaurant thousands in future business. I've heard great things about the food but I'll never go back."
5,Chips & salsa FANTASTIC! Went back for spinach/portobello quesadillas; best ever. Beautiful patio area. Excellent service.
5,"The Barrymore is a great mid-size venue. Great sound, good sight lines, plenty of room to stand up front, and to top it all off, a ceiling of twinkling stars. Parking can be a little tricky, but after going a few times you learn the side streets. 

Some bands I've seen here include Stars, Bright Eyes, She & Him, Jonny Lang, The Mars Volta, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs - one of the most memorable shows ever because Karen O. was swilling from a bottle of champagne, fell off the stage, and managed to keep singing the entire time without missing a note or spilling a drop."
1,The 1 Star was for the Mahi tacos that was the only thing that was great about this experience. Being from San Diego I am spoiled when it comes to great Mexican food and service. First off when you order a shot Put it in a small rocks glass not a plastic cup that you make jello shooters in! Serve real salsa and guacamole Please for goodness sake! If your going to call yourself a Mexican establishment then do it right! Please hire a waitress that has a brain and isn't slow! If it wasn't for the fact it was a go away party I would have never stepped foot in a such a dirty establishment.  WORST MANGO AND STRAWBERRY MARGARITAS EVER!!
1,"SO, DON'T STAY HERE IF YOU HAVE OPTIONS. WHY U ASK???  
OK, let's just say I LOVE history and architecture, but 3stars equals one faucet for hot AND cold water, a shower bigger than 2ft x 2ft, more privacy via better insulation (lets just say I know when both of  my neighbors were having moments of ""intimacy"", one just got done, that's why I'm writing my review, because it's like I WAS THERE!!!!!!) 
3stars = furniture that was made before 1965. OK, then lets recap.. No thermostat, so you have ZERO control over your temp for your room, TV was old school, as was the furniture, carpeting, bathroom (2 faucets 1hot and 1cold, not both under 1... Shower being ICE cold one second and SCAULDING HOT the next second without warning, the terrible internet connection (which did not work the first night, then I told the front desk clerk and their response was to use the internet on the 1st floor even though I was located on the 5th floor, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE) 
The valet parking attendant who tried to pick up my friend, or well, why don't u enjoy ur stay here and write a review for me to ENJOY?? Location is the only thing this hotel has going for it, unless u live in a tent, are homeless, or can afford to spend cash on a terribly overrated hotel. IF this is 3 stars, I'm a millionaire, by reading this review, you know Im not, and this hotel is a joke... Ok, check the swimming pool and tell me how you're going to get a tan... 3stars my A**"
1,"April 2012 I entered Boston Store in East Town Mall in Madison Wisconsin. I was in the store for about an hour and a half. I decided to try on some dresses & skirts. I went into a dressing room to change. I went to the room furthest from the dressing entry way. While changing my clothes I heard a mans voice.

I frantically search for a way to lock the door, but there is not lock! The door flies open! There is a man standing there looking me up & down, smiling at me! I was trying on dresses so I was completely undressed. I went into shock, screaming you can be in here!! I slammed the door ( which flew back open, no lock or latch) I put a chair in front of it and frantically I got dressed. I came out of the dressing room yelling ""there is a man in the dressing room""!

The clerks told him he shouldn't be in there, but weren't that concerned about what just happened to me! The only person who seem to care was a customer, she appeared to be shocked about the situation I left the store in tears.

The next day I called the manager. She didn't think it was a big deal! I said ""why don't you have locks on the dressing room doors? You could have prevented this horrible situation!"" She had no response to my question. She said she would send me a $50.00 gift card, but I received no apology, how insulting!

Come to find out not a single dressing room in Boston Store East Town, not even lingerie dept has a lock on the door. I believe this is every woman's worst nightmare!

Aren't we supposed to feel safe in a store while in a state of undress? I wish it had not happened to me, but it did. I would like to bring awareness to other women. I will always make sure the dressing room has a lock before I enter and undress.

I spoke with store manager several times. I let her know I spend thousand of dollars every year at Boston Store. She didn't seem to care. I asked to speak with upper management, she will not give phone number I gave her mine. To date no one has called.

I feel I was stalked at Boston Store that day. He may have known there were no locks and followed me into dressing room. I feel lucky I was no raped!

I want other women to hear my story and be sure to check dressing rooms for locks. I also want people to hear about the complete lack of compassion/ empathy I received from the store manager who represents this this company."
1,This place works with another doctor service (A2ZHome) and they made the appointment without any knowledge to my father (an 81 year old very sick man).  We got a nice little bill in the mail for $25 because we had no knowledge of this appointment only the robot call the day before that I then called the answering service and told them to leave a message that we would NOT be there.  My father was just to weak and sick to leave the home.  But I guess that doesn't matter.  I have been in the medical profession for 20 year and NEVER got a bill for a no show.  I guess they need lunch money.  Not quite sure how they are as doctors but I know they are not the ones we will ever see.
5,"This is a sports bar owned by ""legendary"" native Alice Cooper. They are now known for the ""Big Unit"" ginormous hot dog. 

It's good and fun for what it is. The staff is always pleasant, even with their painted eyes. The food is what it is, good and nothing fancy. It is just a fun place to take people or hang out when you need to be downtown."
1,This place has nothing going! They don't know basic importance about Italian bread. It's disgusting places like this are open and people rave about it. Guy would be ticked if he saw what they're serving. It sure ain't money baby any more or on point. Also it's pricy ! I think they got a license to steal !
5,"Great authentic Hong Kong food.  I don't like all of the food they serve, but the stuff I order is the exceptional.  This is one of those ""hole in the wall"" places with great food. I highly recommend the Chow Fun, the Hunan Beef, ginger and green onion snapper (fried)...

This is one of my favorite spots. 

Updated:

We have been visiting this place once or twice a week and we are still loving it.  I just added sesame chicken to the rotation and it is also amazing.  We love this place."
1,"What do you get when you mix the smell of mold with the smell of 6-month-old sweat? This 24 Hour Fitness location

I started to feel ill after only 10 minutes of breathing in that horrible smell!

Everything from the stationary bikes to the sanitizer dispensers are in disrepair.

I hope to be updating my review soon with more stars, but things are only getting worse at this juncture."
5,this place has a shuffleboard table and a nice dive bar ambiance.  Don the weeknight bartender was voted best bartender in Madison by the Isthmus' reader's choice poll.
1,"I'm kind of shocked.  

I'm an Arizona-born-native and I've been to the Zoo and the Zoolights over SEVERAL decades.  I've been bored out of my skull every time.  As an adult, I've attended these events with the youngsters because they somehow believe it's cool.  If you're looking to score husband-points, then, by all means, drag everyone there.  Your feet and legs will be sore from all the walking they make you do.  If you're looking for enjoyment, DO NOT BOTHER.  The sneaky and insidious problem is that this place is EXTREMELY expensive, and pretends that they are providing a service to the community.  Let me explain---  they truly believe that they are a worth-while value for every family dollar you're spending.  Yet, don't believe a salesman--- they wiil bend the truth every time, and smile at you while they take your dollar.  And now, on the the Big Three:

1)  Price:  This is the absolute worst problem with this seemingly, family-friendly place.  I mean, who would think that a City Zoo would be trying to scalp you for cash?  Let me give you an example of a small family of 4... this can EASILY turn into a $100 day.  For a 6-8 person group of working-class families, this can easily reach over $150, and outside of a $50,000/yr income household.  If your kids bring friends, it will be even more.  You'll hear cashiers say that ""their Zoo"" is worthy of their out-of-reach-for-the-common-man pricing.  Their answer is simply rhetoric, because, when pressed, they won't be able to explain why the price is this high for a family.  

The bottom line is that, their prices are so incredibly high, that Joe-average, and his family, cannot afford to visit this local zoo without budgeting for it over a couple of months.  Maybe we should've left our fixed-income Grandma and Grandpa at home, although that didn't seem right. 

2)  Service:  Everyone we met was attentive and receptive.  They seemed to genuinely want you to have a good time.  

3)  Taste:  Everything we tried was tasty, although it was hard to enjoy because everything is 3 times the price that it should be.  

In Summation:  I'm not sure why this place is recommended by any kind of governmental body, as to why this is a benefit to the State of Arizona, unless they are making some kind of profit from it.  NO, WAIT, ---- they tax every transaction within the Zoo's control.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skip this next portion if you're married with kids.  This section is addressed to some Weinee that complained about my comments where I said the $18 entrance fee was too high... 

     -----Since you're single, probably going double-dutch, it's no wonder why you'll be shocked by what I've said, because, ""...dude, it's only $18...."".  That's when everyone else knows that you are alone and have no family responsibilities.  While I might envy your ease-of-movement-as-a-single-guy, please gauge your speculation on the # of your children and the # of your extended family.  For example:  5 kids, plus their total of 11 friends, plus 3 grandparents, for tickets to get in.  Include food/drink while you're there, and I don't even have a big family.  At those rates, I'm sure you'll agree, that this place is monetarily ANTI-FAMILY and prohibitively EXPENSIVE.  No, wait....  LET'S GO EVERY WEEKEND, BECAUSE I'M SINGLE ON A DOUBLE-DUTCH DATE!!!  

Way to go, Commenter Weinee.-----"
5,"Great place, I visited there this weekend and the service was blazing fast. I had the goat cheese chicken sandwich and it was excellent!"
5,I have had 2 great experiences with Joyce (a rehearsal dress and my post-wedding picnic dress) and just called for an appointment for a bridesmaid dress. She does a great job and is straightforward.
5,"Carl did an incredible job on my wedding cake. My husband and I chose Carl as our baker at a wedding show. I had read online to be wary of bakers who use a lot of filling to disguise dry or flavorless cake, and this is what we were experiencing again and again at the wedding show...until we found Carl's booth. We both tried a different kind, and we both decided on the spot that this bakery would be designing our cake. The prices were very reasonable, and the cake received a ton of compliments at the wedding! Oh, the flavors we ended up choosing were hazelnut apricot and white chocolate raspberry."
1,Waiting for airport shuttle for 40 minutes. I quit! Absolute BS - your 1.6 miles from the airport. Nice job. I'll thankfully get on the 3rd Fairfield shuttle I've seen on my wait. Slackers.....
1,"The epitome of a crap chain.  Why did I get talked into going here?  Because I am a tool.  Crowded, loud, mediocre food, slow service, and on this particular occasion a strange man two tables down and across the aisle staring at me and not his dining companion, during the entire meal.  I should have just yelled, ""watch my head spin"" and vomited there at the table."
1,"This place was gross and depressing.  We live nearby, but I will avoid ever going back.  We went to Taco Tuesday and were greeted with horrible service and even worse food.  I did not come here expecting anything nice or classy, so even with low expectations I left feeling slightly down and depressed from this sad place."
5,"Had a remote start/security system installed there on my G5 and then got a new car and they swapped it to my new car for cheap. 

Very friendly and awesome people. Would recommend this place to people."
1,"When I was in highschool various clubs used to sell Karsh's bagels around campus to raise money. I would buy a bagel and cream cheese and hide it in my backpack to munch on during class. Soooo good!
 I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to pop in for a bagel and cream cheese. 
The guy behind the counter was nice enough, I told him my order which came to $2.95 or something just barely under $3.  I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under $3. I apologized and said I didn't have any cash and offered to run the the ATM.  The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  (the owner? manager on duty maybe?) if she would let me use my card. She looked right at me all stink-eyed and said ""No"" and returned to what she was doing. No apology, no ""I'm sorry but there is an ATM at so and so...."" Very curt. 
Thanks a lot personality plus! I will not be returning and I hope you choke on a matzo ball. 
Shame too, I loved those bagels."
1,"Last Friday we tempted fate and headed over to Honey Bear's BBQ restaurant in Phoenix. We equipped ourselves with full kevlar body suits complete with knee cap armor.

During lunch hours it can be hard to find a parking slot at Honey Bear's Bar-B-Q restaurant. There are probably 20 spots and most of them fill up pretty quickly. From the outside, Honey Bear's looks as if it has had it's share of violence and has survived through it all. Fortunately enough, the inside makes up for the outside, but only in part. The restaurant is clean and the food appears to be prepared in a clean environment. But the whole building and the front part sure could do with a fresh coat of paint. That whole part of Phoenix is pretty runned down anyways. Honey Bear's is probably the best kept of its neighbors. Even so, don't attempt to gamble with your life and walk from work to the restaurant, you might get stabbed or shot at or both -- you've been warned.

Many people in our office love Honey Bear's and if they had the chance would go and eat there every day. Out of the three times I've been to Honey Bear's during two of them I've gotten a BBQ sandwich and the other time I got a salad. The salad was nothing to write home about and honestly I didn't expect it to be. The place specializes in Tennessee style BBQ and not in salads. So if BBQ doesn't turn you on, then neither will Honey Bear's. The BBQ sandwiches at Honey Bear's never seem to impress me though. It just reminds me of sloppy joe and honestly I'd rather have a sandwich made with Manwich than with their BBQ chicken. Manwich is at the very least ""managable"". The meat on the sandwichs at Honey Bear's seem to be all over the place. It is uncontrollable almost. Their is no picking your sandwich up and eating it. If you try, it is just a mess. You end up having to eat your sandwich with a fork. Com'on now, is that how the people in Tennesee eat their sandwiches? With a fork? Yea, it's true what their moto says, ""You don't need no teeth to eat our meat!"", but I can guarantee you, you'll need a fork.

As for food presentation, Honey Bear's doesn't do so well. Their sandwiches come wrapped in tin foil and the first impression you get is that there was no care put into it when they made it. They just plopted the meat on and moved on to the next customer.

I have heard through various channels that Honey Bears tastes like cafateria food. Atleast I'm not the only hater.

The price for food at Honey Bear's is about $5 just for the sandwich alone. With a drink and a side order of something it will usually run you about $8. The whole menu is pretty much a-la-carte.

We will probably visit Honey Bear's agian because my co-workers have a thing for BBQ. But honestly, I think that Honey Bear's reputation is far better than their food and food presentation."

5,"I attended Mas here last Sunday and so happy I did! Sunday before last, I was dragged to Mass at The Franciscan Renewal Center and it was not joy. It was far too Liberal -- it's simply not my preference as a Catholic.

Walking towards the Cathedral, you just feel a sense of history -- it's simply beautiful. I adore so many Patron Saints so I love all the decorated alters. Choir is simply amazing! Times keep changing...but I prefer to celebrate Catholic Mass in a more traditional manor. I attend St. Francis Xavier and Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church on a regular basis but will definitely attend Mass here more often."
1,"The coupon here that says ""2 dollars off regular hand car wash"", does not apply to a regular car wash. 

It only applies to their more expensive car wash AND detail+ cleaning wash. 

That doesn't make too much sense to me..."
1,"Greasy tacos, the only thing good was the spicy salsa. I got the chicken tacos and they were hella greasy with half-melted cheese."
1,"the food was cold including the soup,fries.  the brisket was dry and the service was awful.  The ruben was awful."
5,"This place is, amazing.  The owners are very welcoming, and when you eat breakfast it is like you are sitting in your parent's dinning room.  The room we stayed in was beautiful.  It had a huge shower/steam room, mini bar, great TV with satellite, fire place, and a bed that swallows you.  There are other features to this B&B other than the place itself.  As mentioned, there is the most amazing dog EVER here, properly named ""Happy"".  There are also a handful of amazing cats on the property that will gladly accompany you for a stroll on the property.  It's nice to hear that the B&B is also pretty sustainable.  All the food they make is pretty much from their farm/garden (fresh eggs, veggies) and anything that can not be grown on their property is from close by.  We have stayed at a handful of B&Bs but this one takes the cake.  I would recommend The Speckled Hen Inn B&B to anyone.  I couldn't even wait to leave our room to post this review!"
1,"Do not go here. First off, I asked them for a exterior detail. They charged me 150 dollars for an ""oversize  SUV"" when in fact I had a little Land Rover, and I asked them not to do the hood as it had been recently painted. They did the hood anyway, and made me wait 4 hours for a job they said they could do in 90-120 minutes."
5,"I seriously can't believe no one has reviewed Buck's yet.  Buck's pizza is my all-time favorite thin crust pizza ever.  The sauce is just right, they cut the pizza into little squares, and the crust is crackery and crisp.

It's take-out only, but they deliver.  This was my favorite pizza as a kid, and my parents favorite pizza when they were kids.  Now that the west side location has moved to University Ave, and like 2 blocks from my house, it's going to be hard to resist the temptation to eat it daily."
5,"Excellent way to ease the exquisite pain of waiting for a table next door at Pizzeria Bianco. Nice wine selection and great snacks to tease your appetite. 

Chuck is a top-notch wine guru, and Vishaka enchants with her poetic description of the cheese plate."
1,"terrible selection of shoes and jeans, and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop. if you absolutely must visit a department store, drive a few miles and hit up macy's instead."
5,"My wife and I ate here prior to an event downtown. Metro light rail is conveniently right outside and an easy trip down to US Airways Center. We had a truffle tremor goat cheese plate with the Brancott Pinot Noir for an appetizer along with the poached pear appetizer. This was fantastic! Highly recommended. I think we'll be buying some if we can't find them for home use. I had the fillet mignon with the suggested cab sav and she had the Parmesan encrusted chicken with the suggested Pinot Gris. Both entrees were delicious. $87 before tip for 2 apps, 2 entrees and 3 glasses of wine. Portion sizes were on the small side, but we still left full.  We may be back for desert after the show! We'll definitely will be back for our next downtown event!"
1,"Ok, first time I was here was for lunch. I had the cheeseburger and it was one of the best hamburgers I had ever had. Noticed the pool, darts, pinball, golden tee, and ancient bowling game and thought I would take my friends back there and share this incredible place. 

two days later, for dinner and drinks, 3 of us went in and saw only one person working on a Friday night. She was cooking, bartending, handling money, scratching her head, shaking hands, cleaning bar tops, running dishes, etc.... did I mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time? We ate our dinners, disgustedly, thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it. She was entertaining, all over the place, yelling, throwing things, etc. I'm pretty nieve, and didn't know until my buddy told me that she was on meth at that time. So there we have it, a restaurant I thought would be a new favorite with a methead bartender that doesn't observe any food safety laws or regulations.

I'll be getting my hepititis c test next week. (joking.... kinda)"
1,"My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot. One word can describe this place GROSS!!! The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment. The salsa was lame, the chips stale. There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice. Other than that don't waste your money GO TO ABUELO'S...it may be on the west side but it never disappoints."
1,"I always give the benefit of the doubt, but so far this has been an awful experience with this office. My son was fitted 2 months ago for an AFO splint (these are time sensitive due to growth). We have called only to be given the runaround, sent to voicemails, and never have return calls. Then they blame it on our insurance company not approving it until a month after fitting. We were mailed an approval letter from our insurance company before that- which proves someone at the office is falling down in their job to follow up! Despite that, we waited again. Now, 2 months later and numerous phone calls (even from our PT), I only got a hold of someone today. After having to ""search"" for information- she called back (which was a surprise unto itself) and guess what?! It's there! It's a miracle! Who knows how long it has been sitting there. Severe lack of organization, courtesy, and good service at this office!"
5,I have this catered at work often.  Always fresh and delicious.  I especially enjoy the chicken kabob platter with brown rice and fresh salad with Pita.  Very consistent in taste and quality.   I always wonder why this location is not busier.  It is certainly a well kept secret.
5,"BEST SWEET MEAT IN MADISON! The sauce is unique and fantastic with tiny onion pieces in it contributing a bite to the sweetness of the base with it's slight tang. The meat is prepared exactly how you'd expect--falling off the bone with a slight resistance. I'd kill for these ribs! ...I'm serious... For take out, I find the ribs to be a little under sauced. I bought a bottle of Smoky Jon's Sauce to take home to load up the ribs."
5,"The Village Green, I call it the VG for very good. If you want a good greasy burger, crispy golden fries, non-greasy crunchy cheese curds, a nice selection of local brews on tap and fast friendly service this place is for you."
5,Perfect hole in the wall Diner with awesome friendly service and some awesome soul food to back it up. everything on the menu is amazing! go see it and experiance it for yourself. it's truly unique.
5,"Gotta give this place a 5 star rating for the food AND the staff. We've eaten at all their stores--even the ones they ill advisedly closed. All are superb. The food is just about the best--we like the pork taquitos. the green corn tomales, and the chili pablamos rellenos (not your grandmother's chilli rellenos). The wait staff and management make you feel like this is YOUR place. They used to make a fantastic queso fundido--encourage them, maybe they will restart.  Dos Equis prices during happy hour are worth the visit--goes great with the hot bean dip!

Do it, you'll love it."
5,"Amazing amazing melt in your mouth food,  affordable, funny down to earth staff, fun visits! Go here now!"
5,"Sheer deliciousness! Had the sunrise... It was in a biscuit, absolutely delightful, very filling and superbly made.
To add to that, the atmosphere is relaxed and laid back, and the experience is very different from the normal fare.

The staff was pretty friendly and checked on us several times. (I guess it helps that you add the gratuity while ordering+paying, instead of after the meal?)"
1,"Massive sewer roach issue and I will scream it from the mountain tops until it is addressed. I fucking hate living here...They act like they're all over it but they're not.
 The staff fucks each other and the units are poorly maintained. They put a dog area right outside my apartment and people just bring their dogs to shit and piss...

The gate is constantly broken and there is no security here. When I'm in the pool at night I hear gunshots! When I asked about the shady online reviews at EVERY reputable online renters community/open forum my rental agent told me not to worry about it lmao!!!

RENTER BEWARE!!!!! Please feel free to contact me before you consider renting here. 

I can't WAIT until this lease is up."
1,"I felt the buyer I encountered today was very uninformed, unqualified and quite frankly rude in his opinions of the brand of clothing I had brought in. I don't care if you buy the whole bag or none of it, that decision alone should suffice. 
I also don't care to know what you personally think about the design aesthetic of a brand. After so many years of exemplary service in both the sales and buying departments it annoys me to see the tittle of buyer handed out to whomever."
1,"I would be very very cautious of this company.  I was contacted to start work through them.  They actually did not have any work.  They don't talk with the companies that they are supposed to work with, instead just leave you hanging with no explanation (or offer you another job hundreds of miles away from home.   Never again!"
5,"Easy on-line menu, great selection and fabulous food. 

I ordered hot/ sour soup, egg roll and chicken/ broccoli. All of it was great. I can't wait to go back."
5,"I've been in DC for nearly five years now and every now and then, I still get an incredible craving for Rosita's Place.  I miss the salsa verde.  I miss the albondigas soup.  I miss the bean and cheese burritos enchilada style.  Sigh.  

Nothing on this coast even comes close to the quality, authentic Mexican food this joint offers.  It's the first stop I make whenever I return to the Valley.  

Get past the surly wait staff and the worn exterior.

This place will not let you down."
5,"Oh yum! We had a great time at this restaurant and the food was wonderful. I would have liked bigger portions, but the food was really good. I would go there again."
1,"If I could give them minus 100 stars, I would do so. 
My partner and I live in Central Phoenix and had friends from San Diego in for a visit last weekend.  After showing them around town on Sunday, Dec. 29th we were all hungry around 1pm. With the numerous dining options in Central Phoenix we decided to go to the Duck and Decanter on E. Camelback.  Friends in town have been raving about that place for years and now this was our opportunity to try it and show our friends a good time.  We arrived last Sunday a little after 1pm.  Outside was very busy but managed to find a an empty table for the four of us.  I decided to wait at the table to save it as it was the last one available. The others went inside to place our orders. My first impression was. Not good. There was no landscaping, vegetation or flowers. Felt like we were sitting on a concrete slab in the shopping center parking lot.  Also looked a bit trashy with several dirty tables left unattended. Ambiance a big Zero.  After about 25 mins of waiting outside at the table the rest of my party came out with brown paper bags and drink cups.  In that amount of time we could of had a fabulous sit down and served lunch at one of the many great cafés in the neighborhood. They said it was busy ordering the food and only two persons working behind the line taking orders.  On a busy Sunday afternoon this is unacceptable. I ordered a BLT on sourdough bread with a side of coleslaw.  For almost $8.00 per sandwich they could afford to be a little less chinsy with them. The sourdough bread was just cheap white bread that you can buy at the grocery for 99 cents per loaf.  There were exactly 2 slices of over cooked bacon with a piece of brown wilted lettuce on mayo.  The only ingredient they were generous with was the whole tomato that was sliced and piled on the sandwich to make it appear that it was a heartier sandwich.  I didn't order a big fat tomato and mayo sandwich. Shame on you Duck and Decenter.  My side of coleslaw was practically inedible.  Coleslaw swimming in watered down slaw sauce (more like mayonnaise and warm milk) was not at all tasty.  Another person in my party ordered an over priced spinach salad with barely any spinach.  She never told them when ordering yo hold the spinach. Really people!!!! Also she had to wait another 25 mins to get her ice tea because she was told that they had run out. Couldn't they have told her when she ordered it and let her make a different drink choice.  While eating our less than acceptable meal a man was playing the guitar and singing.  He sounded okay but his volume was way way to loud. We literally could not even coo in ate with each other being at least 50 feet away from him.  This total experience at the Duck and Decanter left a bitter taste in my mouth and not just from the awful food. We will never be back.  They can keep their lousy service, inedible over priced food and ""cluck it""."
1,"Terrible service from the manager Dave at this marshalls location. I tried to return something and he literally yelled at me and belittled me in front of a line full of customers for not having everything I needed to return the items. Get the hell over yourself! It blows my mind that the customer service at these establishments are so terrible considering how much competition there is in this day and age!

Not only was he rude to me but also to the woman that was trying to help me do my return. Will never shop at this location or let anyone I care about give there money to this shitty store."
1,"I called this morning because my USB hard drive is not being recognize by my computer. I asked what it would cost to repair it. I was told to come down and they'd take a look at it. I took the morning off of work and drove 45 mins to their shop on Camelback Rd. I showed up and they didn't even look at it. They said it would cost $200 for the inspection and up to $999 to repair it and they would have to send it to another place that has skilled people and the tools to repair something . 

They could have told me that over the phone and I would have not taken the morning off and drove all the way out there. I was definitely misled today and it cost me time and money. Their name is deceptive also because they cannot repair or recover data. They send it to someone who can. They should be called Data Mailers, or Data Parcel Services. A**holes

I found this program called Get Data Back, it costs $80, but I was able to recover all of the files I wanted from the USB drive. That sure beats $1199 these scoundrels wanted to charge me."
5,"Never been for the fish fry (I've never had the patience to wait through the crowds they get on Fridays), but the steaks are great for the price. Drinks are cheap and strong, service is always spot-on and the atmosphere is a hoot. It's a little piece of authentic retro Wisconsin. Fun to take out-of-town guests to."
1,"Danger Will Robinson! Avoid this place. Stale chips, Pace Picante salsa, microwaved food. I ordered a chimi and the middle was still frozen. Server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu. The dining area is extremely shabby: ripped cushions and dingy tables. I do not know why I stayed after the first five minutes."
5,"I'd have to say TTY has been a good experience. The instructors have been super helpful. They do what they can to motivate you to keep coming to class and keep going. I read the previous review, and I disagree. I came here on my own free will and was not pressured to start. I passed my A+ and Network+ with their help and have been working on my CCNA.  A lot of people here have told me this place has helped them too. I remember when I first showed up and got right to work. They provided me all the tools that I needed to get moving. If you want to speak to someone there, ask to speak to Hiro (instructor) or Gabe (instructor), they both have real life experience in the IT industry. Both can walk you through understanding anything you need."
5,"This place is unbelievably fantastic. Lyna did my manicure and Jimmy did my ""gel glitter fade"" and they were so SO good. My nails have seriously never looked better. You HAVE to go here. Have Jimmy do a killer design. He is very talented. I even had some yummy wine... Thank you both so much!"
5,"5 star reviews aren't just for the fanciest places on Earth.  Oh no.  5 stars within a class.  Bandaids is in it's own class of dirty, run down, last stop stripper establishments and within that class, Bandaids is primo.  

I've never had a bad time here.  Never."
5,"I love this place. I'd consider moving back to Arizona just for The Blue Fin (not really but maybe). Really really good food, very decent prices, quite healthy portions...

only cons:
close early
no weekends

But great sushi, great Japanese food, etc etc etc"
1,"A SNOW JOB......  Its bad enough that the store that the store you go in to has the AC at 40 minus zero where an ice cube feels warmer.  But what is even more disappointing about this center is that the reception from the front counter is even colder.  I was standing at the counter for a few mi nuts & was watching this person interact with another coworker.  When i was finally helped the greeting was so phony and so over the top.  I got my printing done which was OK, the copy had specks over it .    Then to make maters even worse I was kept being asked to purchase additional items which they refer ed to as the products of the month.   

I say Run as fast as you can away from this center"
1,"I cannot in good faith recommend this restaurant.   This is definitely the low end of Chinese food for Phoenix.   Normally I'd try a place more than once, but, in this case... Not going to happen."
1,"RUN AWAY!  Went for brunch mid morning on a Friday, seated in the corner of a back room (sure to be ignored).  After browsing their 10 page, grimey-ass, PrintShop menu still covered with syrup from the 90's on it, and multiple servers/runners/bussers passing me by multiple times for 10 minutes without so much as a check in or glass of water, I peaced out."
1,"I was in the Phoenix area for baseball spring training and was looking for a unique restarant experience.  As a huge fan of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, I could not pass this restaurant up, as I had never had a bad experience at a restaurant that Guy Fieri had recommended.  I went there with several friends (party of 6, including children).  

My friend and I started with the house salad, which consisted of mixed greens with a very heavy oil vinegrette on it.  The mixed greens were fresh and tasty, but there was so much oil left on my plate after eating the salad, that I used it with the Italian bread that was served to the table before the main course.

Across the table, we ordered the spaghetti, maccaroni and cheese, and the spaghetti neri (squid ink pasta with oysters, shrimp, and calamari).  I had the spaghetti neri.  I did not try the other dishes, but they looked and smelled delicious.  The spaghetti neri was fairly tastless in terms of the tomato+wine sauce, and was very bland and dissappointing.  The seafood (oysters in particular) were a bit ""fishy"", similar to sushi purchased in a groccery store (sometimes), but not so bad as to preclude eating.  However, the next day, I wish I had not, I had very bad case of food poisening (fever, vomiting) that night and the next day.  I called the restaurant the next day to let them know their seafood might be bad and the manager/owner (Rich) told me it couldn't possibly be their food.  Since my friend and I ate the same foods that day, except for the spaghetti neri, I am 100% sure it was that dish.

I cannot recommend this restaurant.  I am terribly dissappointed at quality of the food, and the owner's attitude, which was brash and bit defensive.  In fact, he did not agree to remove the remaining seafood from the same batch, so that others may not get sick, as well, though he did offer to send a coupon for a free meal on my next trip.  I can only hope that others did not suffer the same fate as I.  If you do dine here, stick to the spaghetti or maccaroni with cheese, and do not order the spaghetti neri!"
5,"I love this place!  They have an incredible selection of cheeses and if you are unsure which one to get, just ask Jeff (the bartender) for a recommendation or a sample.  Some of the cheeses I have discovered in Europe and thought I could never find here, are in their case.

Very good beer, wine and drinks and you can't beat their happy hour deals.  The wait staff provide good service and are friendly.  The perfect place to unwind after work, spoil a staff member or have a memorable meal."
1,"OK-so we went to the zoo this past saturday and just our luck it was ""the busiest day of the year so far"" according to one of the workers.  We had a wonderful time until we got to the paddle boat area and had a horrible customer service experience with an employee named Zach.  We tooled around in the paddle boat for our 20 minute ride and upon leaving went to pick up our $5 deposit.  As we approached the desk Zach raised his voice and said ""you will not be receiving your deposit back because you broke the rules and let your daughter sit in an area that is off limits on the boat."" We had no idea what this kid was talking about.  He again raised his voice and people started to stare...he said ""you signed a contract that said she wasn't allowed to sit in the middle of the boat.  You made a decision to break their rules and therefore have lost your deposit.""  WOW.  All I can say is if this is such a dire safety issue, why not tell people when they get in the boat?  So ridiculous and quite the scam to keep our $5.  They even had devised a ""hand signal"" so the person at the cash register would know not to give our money to us.  The most curious thing to us was why didn't they just tell us to have her move over while we were in the boat?  They never mentioned it to us.  It seriously ruined our trip.  Zach, you really take your job way too seriously dude.  Oh, and I stopped payment on my debit card-take that!"
5,Amazing!  Order the super nachos to go!!
5,"This diner came well recommended by the nice folks at the Phoenix hostel just a few blocks away. Easy walking distance in this cool little neighborhood from the hostel and the fun stuff to do on 5th street. 

The old diner still has the 50's vibe with classic neon, but the food is non-classical diner fare (in a great way), is healthy and satisfying, and the folks working there are legit - down to earth and friendly. Just chill folks, no pretense, great food. 

It's awesome to be back in the ""south"" and see iced tea on the menu. I kept requesting more, and the cool tattooed chick just brought me out a pitcher, a whole bowl of lemon slices and a smile.  That's hospitality. 

I had the ""KOKO"", a hand breaded, fried chicken breast in a homemade biscuit with some kind of homemade remoulade, baby greens, tomato and a side of vinegar-based red coleslaw. Awesome. Friends had a deep fried avocado (vegan) po-boy and the other gad the fish po-boy, both of which looked great. 

Definitely coming back.

Edit:  BTW, just saw on their online menu that they have a beer terrine salad, don't know how I overlooked that last night, but I'm kicking myself. Any place that has beets on the menu gets an automatic A++."
5,"Great shop - A fine haircut plus all the positive aspects of old time service and more.  A+ for the Buckeye Barber!  Todd carries on the tradition on Buckeye Rd.

As for the lack of Sat. hours there must be a shop open in ChiTown that will  do your hair before you come visit cheddarland.  Spare us please!"
1,"I responded to a Craigslist Ad.  I contacted them and said I wanted the merchandise.  They wouldn't take a credit card over the phone but said they'd hold item for 1 business day.

After work I rushed to get to the shop by the 7:00 pm close time.  I was 12 min away at 6:50.  I had my sister call while I was driving to tell them I was minutes away and cutting it very close.  The told her they would close at 7:00, period.  At 6:58 I was a few blocks away.  I called again and told them where I was.  They said I had 1 minute and they could not wait for me. 

I pulled in at 7:03 according the the atomic clock.  I could see two people milling around inside.  They could see me.  I called them.  On the 2nd try they answered.  I pleaded with them as I had just driven 45 minutes.  As I told them I didn't even need to come in.  I had cash and they could just hand me the item.  They refused. 

I cannot believe they could not conduct a transaction at 7:03 after I had called them twice and let them know exactly where I was."
1,"I have been coming to this Schlotzsky's for 6 years. The old man is the rudest a**hole you will EVER meet! Half the time he helps me and when he does he talks to me like I am a 5 year old and is EXTREMELY condescending. Even while taking my money he was being sarcastic and rude. When confronting him about the way he spoke with me and how he does it EVERY time I come in, he told me I must only come one or twice a year. In reality, I patronize this company 10-12 times a year, even knowing I am going to be treated like I am wasting his time. The wife is BEYOND amazing! How she puts up with him...I have NO IDEA! I can guarantee I will NEVER spend my money here again. The food is great but absolutely NOT worth putting up with someone treating me so nasty."
5,I love this place. All items on the menu are worthy to try them. My favorite one is the Koko (biscuit with fried chicken). The service is a bit slow but they are so sweet and cool that who cares?
5,"My favorite place for fast food in Madison - I have both locations in my cell phone for quicker pickup.  If it's Thursday try the Shrimp in Cream Sauce or Crawfish in Cream Sauce special....any other day, the Red Beans'n'Rice with Double Sausage will never treat you wrong!"
5,"I'm from east coast and I'm trying to find the owner to let me allow this place in my strip mall this food is truely a touch of its own will hit every tasty bud....please understand!!!!!!!!''''''''you will leave leave happy and talking about""I wish I was their neighbor""'''! This spot will leave its mark....watch our in n out burger....be worried if people know what they are !!!"
5,I absolutely LOVE Metcalfe's.... I mean come on... who doesn't love low Grocery costs and TONS of samples! The people who work here are incredible and are always really helpful when trying to find something. It's a grocery store so I can't say too much but I always love coming here for some reason to get groceries.
5,"Oh my very favorite! 
Poutine! Not at all like the traditional, but oh-so-good and imo, so much better! Sandwiches served on biscuits?!? Heaven! I only wish this place was open for breakfast. 
Oh yes, and service? Top notch!"
1,"From the street, my husband and I thought Zoe's Kitchen would be like Panera - that is, we thought it would serve fast, flavorful, and good-quality lunch fare. None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross. 

We stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option. 

Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara. 

We sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a ""few more minutes."" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!

It wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members. 

As if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return. 

My husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the ""Greek"" marinara tasted like Prego. The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chips!

I guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's Kitchen. We are huge fans of fast, casual, and fresh lunch food, but we found the food at Zoe's to be anything but."
5,"Helpful, friendly staff. Great selection of food and supplies for dogs, cats, birds, fish, rodents and amphibians. They sell cats (many roam the store, so watch your step!), birds, fish and other little beasts, too! They also offer fantastic dog obedience classes and pet grooming -actually, I give them an extra high rating because of the great job they did shaving my cat! Half as expensive as most places and they let me witness/help out as needed, which is much less stressful for my mankitty than the places that require you to drop off your pet for a few hours (or the day)."
1,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced.  Trailers and trucks all over the place, so I had to make a place to park.  Ended up getting cursed out by a maintenance guy.   Nice job U-haul!!!!  Will never be going back to this place again."
5,"I shop here sometimes and it's a very busy market, but everything is fresh. My favorite thing to get here is the fresh corn tortillas they make."
1,"Awful canneloni served on a bath of poorly prepared heavy cream. Very 'unItalian', even the bread tastes stale and poorly prepared. The minestroni soup tasted like canned soup, just right for the strictly senior citizen clientele. My husband had a pasta with Italian sausage and chicken in a marinara sauce. The chunks of canned tomatoes were unappetizing. The one star is awarded for the only good item we ate, the Greek side salad. The waiter was totally goofy, rude and uninterested. He flopped the canneloni at the table with the statement, ""Two enchiladas."" Really??? First time but never again! Disgusting food, terrible service."
5,Fun place!  Very hip!
1,"Unfortunately ZERO stars isn't an option. If you are considering living at Courtney Village, please do yourself an enormous favor and RUN immediately! This is by far the worst place I have ever lived. First and foremost, get ready to be constantly hit with random fees. Your monthly rent will NEVER be the same. You have a base rent, but they pile on the fees constantly every month. Secondly, majority of the maintenance staff are extremely rude. I got yelled at because my dog pooped in the dog park and I didn't immediately run over and pick it up. I had every intention of picking it up, I just wasn't aware I would be scolded for not catching it as it fell out of his ass. Also, one time my roommate was on vacation for the weekend and had locked her bedroom door (which was the master bedroom with the other restroom inside) my toilet handle broke, so I called maintenance. They told me that because I had another restroom in my apartment, even though I had mentioned I didn't have access to it, that it wasn't classified as an ""emergency"" and they wouldn't send anyone until Monday. This happened first thing when I woke up on Saturday. So I had to walk to the public bathroom by the pool all weekend just to use the restroom. Speaking of the pool, if you live on the south side apartments, the pool isn't heated and there is no hot tub, so get ready to rarely or never use the pool. Also, the waterfall feature hasn't worked for about 6 months. At one point it must have been something with the pump that was going out because it was so loud constantly I was worried it was going to explode and kill us all (wishful thinking?!). Another negative, it is in the ghetto. During the 14 month lease I was there for, there was a domestic shooting, a police helicopter hovered over the complex and shined the spotlight in all of the hallways and windows for a good 15 minutes, constant parking lot arguments, as well as parking lot sexual favors, multiple shootings in the area, car break ins, and my personal favorite was when my boyfriend and I were walking in the parking lot and a cop pulled up and asked him very sternly if his name was Clinton (he's not Clinton). I have never felt more unsafe in my life. My boyfriend wouldn't let me take my dog outside alone after dark. If I could go back 14 months ago, I would run for the hills screaming. PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE FOR YOUR OWN SANITY, SAFETY, AND FINANCIAL WELL BEING!"
1,"Looks great. Smells great. When they told me it would be a 30-40 minute wait for a breakfast sandwich I cancelled my order. Seems like an unworkable business model. 

Hire another cook and install another stove. Came all the way here from Spring Green--sad face."
5,"This place is fantastic. The owners are friendly and personable but not overbearing. Happy, their golden doodle dog, is the sweetest and most welcoming ""greeter"" on the planet, yet - again - not overbearing. Guests receive a lovely, multi-course gourmet breakfast, and the owner/chef cheerfully accomodated my request for a gluten-free, vegan meal! The grounds are lovely ... there are lambs and llamas (no joke!) ... one has use of a mini kitchen and a nice little guest hangout area, in addition to one's nice, homey room. We had a jacuzzi in our room. We had no qualms or problems during our stay, at all - this is the comfiest B&B ever!"
5,We love Asia Fresh. bourbon chicken with veg fried rice-perfect. Take away done quickly. service great. Great price.
5,Great place. I have been going there off/on for years!
1,"This place sucks, simply put.  Older venue with narrow hallways, a bitch to get a drink or beer, can hardly walk around the lines of people in the way.  Everything else is what you would expect from an older covered basketball stadium.  The acoustics sound pretty good concert wise.  I always wish concerts were elsewhere - dodge, cricket, jobing."
5,Kevin the massage therapist is great. Listened carefully what I had to say and took care with my shoulder. Amber the receptionist is also great.
1,"I worked near there a couple years ago and would blindly walk in there on my lunch breaks over and over, ignorantly forgetting how mediocre the food was.  But I recently saw a Stixx has opening near there, so I don't even know if they are still in business..."
5,"The best teriyaki you can get for lunch! I love this place and the staff is always pleasant. The healthy special is a great pick that comes with brown rice, white meat teriyaki chicken, salad, and your choice of tea or lemonade. Perfect."
1,"Worst Best Buy ever.

I just had an employee there throw a temper tandrum because I asked him to call someone who has keys to the mobile locker over so I can buy my item.  Treating customers like crap just because someone asks if they can buy something?

Methinks not.  Never again.  NEVER again."
5,"I've been coming here for as long as I remember. Since 1995 at least. Their food has always been consistently good.
Service has always been a little on the slow side, but that is typical in the Mexican Restaurant way. I find the slow service forgivable because the food more than makes up for it."
1,"Not impressed. My coworker and I were waiting for a movie across the street and decided to try and beat the heat by getting some ice cream. I have allergies to soy so I have to be very careful about what I eat as it is in *everything* these days. There were two gentlemen in the store one dark haired and kinda sullen looking,  the other heavy set. I failed to get their names as I was quickly put out by our experience and just wanted to leave. 
The heavy set guy was busy with a customer so we asked the dark haired one if there was nutritional information available and politely explained I had allergies and had to be aware of everything I eat. He looked at us blankly and kind of put out sounding responded ""I have it in a book."" There was a pause as he just stood there staring like we were some sort of circus oddity. Finally, my coworker politely asked if we could see the book. Without saying anything and with a slight roll of his eyes he turned, grabbed the book and shoved it in my face kinda rudely. I took it from him and turned away from him because it was clear he had some sort of problem. I remarked to my coworker ""Friendly... Love that"" because he clearly was not.
Perhaps he despised his low paying job. Perhaps he thought we looked too low class to be in his presence. Perhaps he was having a bad day. Perhaps he was just a jerk. Whatever the case, his unfriendliness and and our unwelcome  were palpable. I flipped absentely through the book but quickly decided I really had a problem giving money to a store who had employees that seemed to think openly treating customers with disrespect was okay . Handing the book back to the employee in question, I smiled and said thank you as we left. As if this wasn't enough, as we were leaving I noted that he never took his eyes off of us and even kind of elbowed his co worker and started making some sort of comment while staring us down through the window of the store as we left. They chuckled amongst themselves if full view of us as I watched. They seemed not to care that I could see their every move. 
When I called back after we left and asked to speak to a manager, at first I was put on hold while whoever answered said they would go get the manager. A couple seconds later, the same person came back and said, ""Oh I'm sorry. She's not here."" He then informed me he had no idea when she would be back in. 
Call me crazy, but I find it hard to believe in a store of that size one could be unaware their manager was no longer in the store and further could not give me any sort of estimation of when she was expected except to say she was ""usually"" around in the morning. 
At any rate, I have scarcely been treated so rudely in a customer service environment ever. So, to the manager, whoever you may be, I would suggest you inform your employee he should endeavor to adjust his attitude towards paying customers if he intends to continue working with the public. Honestly, I really don't care what his problem was. Not my issue. I couldn't care any less what he thought of me or my coworker. However, I steadfastly refuse to give my hard earned money to a store which allows this kind of blatantly unacceptable behavior from one of its employees. Next time, I'll just find a Ben and Jerry's or simply endure the heat without aid."
5,"I've been passing the place for a long time, then tried it because the Subway line was out the door. Tries the Achiote Salad and I've been buying that salad at least four times a month. 

You can't beat the prices for the amount of food on the plate and there's enough of a selection for the kids to enjoy something too."
5,"I'm visiting from LA, so this was the first time I have eaten at Best Of Philly. I will for sure eat there next trip! The Gyros was amazing! And the mushroom steak sub was too die for! Thanks to the nice people working, I think it was the owner and maybe his wife."
1,I HATE this complex! The management staff is very rude and treat residents like crap. Do yourself and find another place in the area. This place is a ripoff and overall pain. There's plenty of nice condos in the area just check padmapper or zillow. Save yourself and stay away!!!!!
5,I've been coming to this location for over 2 years. I have had only fantastic service experiences. Never a bad one!!! They make excellent drinks too! True artisans that know their craft well. Solid!
5,One of my favorite places in Madison. You can never go wrong with an artichoke sand which and some crisscuts (they are worth the extra money).
5,"Can I give them 5 stars because you can drink during Cocktails in the Conservatory? 
Anyone?
Anyone?
I'm doing it. 
Did it."
5,"I can't believe I have driven past this museum a million and one times and never gone in. Just FYI its free on Sunday's in July. 

You want to get out of the heat? You want to do something inexpensive with your family? You want your children to learn something about the culture of Native Americans? This is the place for you!

I brought my son here Sunday before last and he had the best time! There is a ton of puzzles and hands on crafts. Stories and artwork to satisfy the most curious minds. The grounds and architecture are beautiful. I will definitely be back here with my son this summer! 

Good, clean, family fun!

Xo,
Reesie"
5,"Cute little place with great teriyaki!!
Business owner is a very nice older lady, she cheerfully walks around the tables to check if everything is well. 
  The Service is outstanding, teriyaki was delicious with rice and veggies. Also if you get a large drink, you get unlimited refills! Yay for raspberry tea!! 
Great small business with good food and great service. 
Its a must visit if  you're around the area!! :)"
1,"DO NOT PLAY HERE

The bugs were so bad I had to skip the last three holes. Avoid Avoid Avoid."
5,"Outstanding family Mexican restaurant! I've tried several of the other well known Mexican restaurants in Phoenix and Comedor Guadalajara is hands down the best of them all. Very large open restaurant concept (2 large rooms) with no bar but serves alcohol. No TV' either except in the entrance so keeps everyone focused on the group your with and food.

Large platters served so bring your appetite but the flavors are truly authentic and expertly cooked. Service was excellent. Try the7 Mares soup, seafood platters were fresh and delicious. Ejoy!"
5,"If you're comparing this to the other Starbucks in the Madison area, it has been my experience that this one is the best. Clean, friendly, fast, and the drinks are done even more carefully here."
5,Came here to drop few items from my location to this company.  This location is easy to find and plenty of parking right by Chase Field.
1,"Stick with Culvers!  My family and I stopped by on our way biking around the lake. What a rude and disappointing experience. First of all the staff who waited on us, Andrea was short tempered and not into customer service. We tried to order swirl, but they don't have it, we had to come up with a solution, Andrea just said no. We ordered a cone, small sundae and a can of coke. About $10.00 later, I was grudging given a glass filled about 1/3 full of ice for my not very chilled coke. The custard is ok, but nothing special. Another option would to be to continue on the bike path. In Monona there is an ice cream stop by a park on the lake. We will try that next time."
5,"Dave and I were exploring to new places around our new home and came across this lovely cafe in the middle of the Arizona Center. We were greeted and seated right away, we chose the patio to enjoy then spring weather. The ambiance was casual and made you feel like you were eating at home.  The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  We even got a personal visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying our dining.  

We started the dinner off with the best chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.   The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet for Dave's liking. 
For dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  and I had the mini chimichangas.  The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious.  The mini chimichangas did not disappoint mouth watering flavor in every bite.  Both meals were superb.  We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine white chocolate almond tamale.  A fun twist on the traditional tamale.  Even the left overs the next day were amazing. 

Over all this was a fabulous place to visit.  The only downside is that our meal was a bit pricy but I am sure that the $25 margarita pitcher didn't help. I would and will definite visit this place again, especially since it is only 0.2 miles away."
1,"The food was bland, the cheese dip reminded me of cheese wiz and after seated I waited over 15 minutes just to give my drink order.  The only good thing was the chips...not going back."
5,"Free samples of cheese, cheese spreads, and fudge! As good as it gets! 

I love this place. We bought about $15 worth of cheese after being pampered and trying about 10 different types of cheese, 5 types of cheese spreads, and 2 types of fudge. 

The store has tons of Wisconsin favorites, which I suppose is in part of attracting tourists to think that they are purchasing purely ""Wisconsin"" delicacies!"
5,"I think the other reviews sum this place up perfectly.  Ka is THE man, hands down. He takes his time, is very meticulous, and you have a top quality haircut when done.  

The first time he cut my hair I got the official  ""wife seal of approval"" when I got home.  That hadn't happened at any of the other shops I've tried over the years - I have tough hair to cut and she usually cringed when I came home with a new haircut.  I haven't gone anywhere since."
1,Not happy with Marvel....have to agree that they don't care about their customers.  I ordered 10 tons of rocks and scheduled a 7am delivery time.  It is now 11:30am and they still aren't here.  I lost half a day of work and have been paying workers who have been standing around all morning because the materials aren't here.  Very frustrated with this place and will never use them again!
1,"I purchased glasses on 5-3-13.  I am still waiting to receive the glasses that I paid for.  I paid on 5-3-13 and then waited.  After waiting two weeks I called to see when my glasses would be ready and was put on hold.  I was on hold forever when I was finally told that the factory had made an error with my prescription and that they had to be sent back.  I was told that they would rush the service and call me as soon as the glasses were ready.  I waited a week and called to see when the glasses would be ready and was told they just arrived.  I went in and picked them up.  I wore the glasses for two days when a friend informed me that the glasses were not darkening in the sun.  He showed me how the lenses did not change at all in the direct sun light.  I took the glasses back and the representative tried to convince me that the lenses were exactly what I had ordered.  When I asked her to step outside in the sunlight and show me she suddenly decided that maybe all I had was the anti-glare and the lenses were not correct.  She said she would correct the glasses and would do a rush service on the glasses. One week later I was called and told the glasses were ready.  When I went in to pick them up on my lunch I was so disappointed.  They were now trying to give me plain old glasses with the line across the lenses.  I did not want to try them on but the representative insisted.  I told her I was not blind that I could clearly see the line on the lenses so they could not be my glasses.  She insisted that I needed to try them on.  I told her that I want a refund and NO I am not trying the glasses on.  She said she would go get a manager.  I sat there for 15 minutes waiting.  I then met with Diana the Manager.  I was clear that I wanted a refund that I was patient and they had three chances to do my glasses and they could not get the job done.  I am going on vacation next week and I am going on vacation with my glasses and you have not been capable up to this point.  Diana then stated that she would  personally take care of my glasses and that they would be correct and that I would have them in time for my vacation.  She said she would give me a discount for the inconvenience I had been experiencing.  She looked me in the eye and gave me her word.  I looked her back in the eye and said if you do not get it right I will contact her corporate office and then I would find every review place I can to share my experience.  I picked the glasses up today.  I met with Diana and asked if she had checked them and is everything I paid for there and she said yes.  She put my lenses in the glasses and I tried them on.  The glasses seemed to be ok.  Things looked a little fuzzy and the ground appeared to be moving.  I was told there is an adjustment time and that it would clear up soon.  We went outside and I tried them on and they seemed to be more shaded than my old pair of glasses.  We went in and she did some more adjustments to the glasses and cleaned them.  I again asked her if all the features I paid for are on the glasses and she said yes.  She went outside again with the glasses while I was waiting and she checked them in the sun.  Diana said yes everything is on the glasses that you ordered.  I was running late on my lunch hour and was feeling rushed to get back to the office.  Diana refunded $39.99 on the glasses for the inconvenience I experienced.  When I got home tonight and stood out in the sun for five minutes, nothing happened.  The lenses do not darken at all.  The lenses do appear to have a thick anti-glare coating.  There definitely is no change to the lenses when standing in direct sunlight.  I will return tomorrow morning and get my refund.  I am concerned that they will make the refund difficult, but if a refund is not given then I would have to call their actions fraudulent. I had insurance that paid a portion of the bill.  The insurance company has also been charged for an item not received. If necessary I will be calling the fraud department at United Health Care. I have been deceived and feel like a foolish woman.  I am foolish to the tune of 
$ 793.90.  I will follow up this post with the results of my visit tomorrow where I intend to get a refund.
5-5-2013 Went back this morning to return the glasses.  The representative put them under a special lite they had and presto the glasses got dark. We then went outside and the glasses were definitely darker.  I really felt like something was wrong because I had the glasses outside at home for an hour in and out of the sunlight and they never got dark like they did at the store. The glasses are still fuzzy when I try to read small print.  I am going to bring them to my eye doctor to have them checked to see if they have been made to the prescription that I was given. I also double checked my paperwork and noticed a $135.00 copay I was charged.  My benefits show that I have a $25.00 copay. I will be calling United Health Care Monday to verify my benefits."
5,This place is awesome! My favorite lesbian bar in town!
1,"I am a dive bar expert.  I love me a good dive bar.  The darker and older the better.  The surly regulars on the fringes of society are my people.

This place is shit.  Not 'The Shit'.  Actual shit, as in a piece of crap.

We ordered wings, after the bartender bragged how they were the best in town, and the regulars started laughing about how they just cooked a bunch of fish they caught locally in the frier, and that our wings were gonna taste fishy.  Not in a ""we're fuckin' with you"" way, but more of a ""we have no sense of self"" way.

Homo say what!?!?

They did taste fishy!  We each ate only one.  Everyone was having a great time about it.  We left an entire plate of uneaten wings, and nobody gave a shit.  Fine, no problem.  

We finished our beers and left.

Even if the wings weren't trouty, they were way too big.  Bigger isn't better in the case of wings.  They aren't actually buffalo wings, and shouldnt resemble some bloated and abused fictional beast.  They should be from chickens.  SMALL CREATURES CALLED CHICKENS.


The end."
1,"This is so below average. The restaurant decor is out dated and worn out.  Poor service below average breakfast and how do you even screw up breakfast. Manager asked how was everything I said ""just ok""he said ok did not inquire. Food did not have quality flavor it was very bland."
1,"How do you get voted best of for 31 years when what is served is awful? This is the worst Chinese food my entire family has had in years. We all ordered different things and none of us could eat our meals. That was $50 wasted. There was no flavor, or the flavor there was did not match the dish. How do you mess up beef fried rice? I can make it with more flavor. The Mongolian beef had a flavor but it was all wrong. If you want to waste money and still be hungry, this is the place for you. How do places keep getting good reviews when they are so bad. I use to trust Yelp reviews but lately, I've been fooled by the reviews."
5,Truly enjoyed thier food here.  Went with another family and got Parrillada De Tres Carnes.  I highly recommend- its now my favorite Mexican Restaurant in AZ.
1,"Be very wary of the Family Video in Sun Prairie, WI, they do a great job trying to up sell you at the counter and next thing you know you are walking out the door with 3-5 movies when you came in intending to get two. 
The problem with this, is they do not indicate anywhere on the movie when they are due back. You do not get a receipt indicating when they are due back, so if you have five movies and one is due back the next day and the other four in five days, you better be darn sure you know what one, or you will be surprised with a $8-$10 late charge. (And hopefully, the person that hands you the movies tells you the correct one) 
When you ask them why they do not print off receipts, they state it is the cost of paper - well, I would think the cost of an angry customer(s) would be more concerning."
5,Great time! Lots to touch and play with and learn! Took our 5 year old daughter with the Summer Pass.
1,"I like the look of this place. The food was not good and actually made me and my friend very sick. Bathroom was SCARY and non 
air conditioned. I really wanted to like this place but it just wasn't good. I liked the atmosphere other than the bathroom.. I could drink here but wont eat here again."
1,"If chain restaurants offer us consistency in service and quality, well, I never need to darken the door of Hard Rock.  Good.  20 people walk in on a Friday night.  There is only 1 table in the WHOLE place - and the highlight of the group was the 100 year old dude wearing suspenders.  

The bartender acted as if the vandal hordes had just descended on her.  Seriously, I think she thought she was done for the night.  She got pissy with our multiple orders, couldn't remember 2 drinks at a time, and generally was a pain in the ass.

None of the drinks stood out as anything fancy, so we started to pack up and leave.  While waiting for my friends to settle up, I stationed myself outside the door, and did some ""in person Yelping""  - basically telling everyone thinking about walking in to run.  

Well, I guess a drunk girl standing outside telling you not to enter is not a good deterrent for everyone.  Out of the 5 couples that came up (Conan O'Brian's show had just ended - go Team Coco!) 2 decided to try somewhere else on my words....smart people, they will go far in life.  The other 3 doubted my wisdom, and ventured inside.  

All 3 walked out before the last of my friends did - every single one of them was stunned at how the single staff member working made them feel like they were intruding (I did exit polling) and decided that there must be another place in Downtown Phoenix on a Friday night that would like some money."
5,"I was travelling from Minneapolis to Indiana with friends when our car broke down in Madison, WI at 10 PM. I called Triple A and they dispatched Prarie Land Towing. Shawn, the driver, tried to jump start the vehicle.  When that failed, he hooked us up and towed us in. Meanwhile, he called ahead to have someone at the shop prep a loaner car for us to use locally until the shop opened in the morning.

We called around 8 AM, but they didn't have a report yet, so we called to have a rental car ready. We asked about whether they were open on Sundays, because that was when we would be coming back through. Although not normally open on Sunday, they were willing to make arrangements with us so we could pick up the car.

At 10:15 AM, they called to let us know whe could pick up the car in 15 minutes. We cancelled the rental and were on the road by 11 AM. Because of the folks at Prairie Land Towing, we made it to our conference, arriving only a few hours later than we planned, but without missing any major events.

If you're ever stranded in the Madison, WI area, ask for Prairie Land Towing!"
1,not good place
5,"I've never felt so compelled to use expletives in a review, but I feel like I could cuss up a storm and still not quite convey how much I'm digging Welcome Diner. 

I've been here three times, twice in the past week, and I can't wait to go again. I had the holy puerco on my first visit, the big Jim on my second, and today I had the Carol with cheese, bacon, and egg added at the suggestion of the guy taking our order. Everything has been utterly impeccable. It's comfort food at its absolute finest. I can't wait to make it through their entire menu and I have absolute confidence that I'll find many more delicious gems just waiting to be devoured. 

The atmosphere and location couldn't be any better either. Sitting outside on a nice wintry Phoenix day in Garfield will no doubt yield some good people watching and you'll be thankful to just be where you are. 

In closing, I want to thank these folks for doing what they're doing. If you haven't been here yet, or if you're for some silly reason on the fence about giving it a shot, stop deliberating and get your tail over there. You'll be happy you did."
1,"Never Again,
I brought my Mountain Bike in (which I bought 1 week earlier from Walmart) to have them replace my flat inner tubes with puncture resistant tubes.)  I came back 20 minutes later when they said it would be done and as I rode away, the back tire rhythmically rubbed against the back brake.  When I returned and told them about it, I was told the back wheel was not true.  It was true for the whole short week since I purchased it from Walmart.  I plan to take it to their competitor (Landis) and pay the extra $15-$25) to have the wheel put back to the straight condition it was in when I brought it to Slippery Pig in the first place.   I would never give a shop another penny for an extra service I should never have needed on a brand new bike which coasted perfectly when I brought it in."
5,Love this place ...the team makes you feel welcome at the drive thru OR if you run inside for the free WIFI.
5,"I have only good things to say about Monty's! If you like unpretentious food that is filled to the brim with flavor you will also like Monty's. We had the meatloaf and chicken in a pie at our table. I think I said ""yumm"" no less than 9 times...really it couldn't be helped! The turtle cheesecake I got to go was also pretty spectacular. I appreciated the service as well. Our server was friendly and available without being overbearing. It was the perfect dinner."
1,"I received the worst service of my existence at this establishment - absolutely awful , uncaring and embarrassing. Our group of 17 arrived at 11am before the rush for a retirement party. Shortly thereafter orders were taken, and others arrived about 15 minutes later and there orders were taken. All were served except me. Even those with late orders- my order was nothing special tuna melt.  Others who ordered the same received there food completed it and still nothing for me. When approached by the manager/ jerk on duty- was told we will get to it.  How awful- it makes one not want to attend large luncheons .  Pass the word don't go to this establishment.

Thanks much,"
5,"My review is for my experience on 04/26/13.  I was in Phoenix to celebrate my 50th birthday in my birth town and decided to have lunch at Alice Cooper'stown. Overall I had an awesome experience.

 I like how the women get into the theme, with cutoff denim shorts, black tanks and tees and AC eye makeup. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful but I want to make a special shout out to Susie. She took outstanding care of me. I decided to go with the tuna casserole based on her suggestion/recommendation...it was wonderful: creamy, great flavor, not fishy smelling or tasting. Onion rings would have been a great side (hint hint). I wasn't familiar with Kilt Lifter and she gave me a sample with my Hefe. It was so good I had two full glasses. Susie was attentive without being overbearing AND invited me to walk around to check out the memorabilia. Good waitress/bartender she is, she gave me a covered cup of water to keep me hydrated.

I especially liked the decor - a combination of music and sports memorabilia with lots of Alice Cooper influence.  The music totally ROCKED.  The restaurant also has a nice selection of tshirts and sweatshirts for sale. Maybe a bit overpriced but hey! they're in business to make money.

Here's a tip: go at lunch. I'm sure the dinner crowd is exactly that - a crowd. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm definitely going back. Thanks Susie for taking care of me!!"
5,"Well, I am trying to eat my way through the menu, but they keep adding delicious new dishes, so it's taking a while.  The service at this place cannot be beat.  When you are seated outside, every member of the team will be by to inquire about your experience and see if there's anything more they can do.  When you're seated inside, you are a part of the whole Welcome Diner experience.

I most recently had the smothered pork plate, which was pulled pork with a beer and onion gravy over a bed of jasmine rice, with sides of delicious collard greens and house-made poblano hush puppies.  It was a heaping plate of food for $11.50.  The next night, we returned, at my niece's request, and I had the Port of Call burger.  It was yummy beefy goodness with perfect fries on the side.

So, it's going to take me a while to sample everything the Welcome Diner has to offer, but I go at least weekly and I am dedicated to sampling all the goodness they have to offer.  This place is a gem.  Don't tell anybody.

Oh, yeah...Bike Rack!"
5,I go here driving in to the Farmer's Market.  Great mochas.  So big!  So wonderful!
5,"No matter your persuasion, there are good times to be had here.  The people watching is spectacular and everyone is super friendly... just watch out for the 70+ year old (!) tranny who looks just amazing, because she will drag your unwilling ass onto the dance floor to teach you to two-step!"
1,"The rice and steamed vegetables were good, but that's about all we could tolerate. We ordered General Tso's, which is what we always get when we first try a Chinese restaurant. It helps us compare to other places.The quality of the chicken used was awful. The dumplings were flavorless. We will not be returning."
5,"This is my new favorite restaurant in the Madison area.  Everything that crossed our table from the fresh pastas to the delicious sauces was a treat.  The portions were generous and the prices reasonable.  The calamari in the appetizer was tender and delicious in a rich and spicy tomato/fennel sauce.  The puttanesca sauce was dense with olives and the whole cloves of roasted garlic were a real treat.  The bread pudding was very good, but for me was a little heavy on the cinnamon.  I think I'll go with the Tiramisu next time.  Our water was pleasant and attentive.  The atmosphere was casual and cozy/romantic...  but I would rather see real candles on the tables vs the battery operated tea lights."
1,"I got caught up in the whole bank locally thing and switched from Chase to Desert Schools.  One of the biggest things I expected was that the customer service would be far superior to that of the big national banks.  Wrong.  

Most of the tellers are, for the most part, nice enough, but the people on the phone are rude, deceitful and spiteful and will do things to make your life miserable if you disagree with them.  One guy there cancelled my debit card just to be an a**hole and his supervisor stood behind his indefensible actions.  Hence, I just closed my account and went to BBVA Compass.  Wow, what a difference."
5,"I admit, I have very high expectations when it comes to service and this place was AMAZING. The stylist definitely took the time to listen to my concerns regarding my hair, gave me a oil/ head massage before shampooing my hair, a hand massage while my hair was conditioning and an amazing cut all for the low price of $33! I already have plans to make it back. Thank you for being so wonderful!"
1,"These have to be one of prettiest but worse managed apartment complexes in the valley. On the surface you would automatically want to live in these apartments just off their appearance but don't be fooled because the management staff at this location is HORRIBLE and don't care whatsoever. I had an issue where maintenance was entering my  apartment because they ""thought"" I had moved out. My lease wasn't up for another month and though I had already moved most of my belongings out I still had a few items in the apartment. Well maintenance decided they would take it upon themselves and ""clean"" the apartment so it could be ready for someone else to move in, while I'm still paying rent for this apartment. In doing so they threw away the belongings I had in the apartment including clothes & towels. Not only had they entered to ""clean"" the apartment once but TWICE! After the first incident I went up to the office and they said ""oh we're not sure if someone has been in your apartment"". Huh?? So silly me I thought that there was NO WAY they would make the mistake of coming back prematurely again after I just went to complain...WRONG! They entered the apartment again without my permission the following week and again threw away my belongings. This time I went to the management office and one girl was trying to contact maintenance to get to the bottom of this. Then out of nowhere here comes the head manager not saying hi & even asking me what happened; she immediately goes on the defensive and says her guys weren't in my apartment and that I need to file a police report because apparently someone must've broken into my apartment. I proceeded to ask her who would break into an apartment lock the door afterwards and CLEAN IT UP??? After she realized she was making no sense she refused talk or help me anymore and said there was nothing they could do. The funny part is I could hear the head maintenance guy in the other lady's office saying ""yeah I went in there the other day because I thought it was vacant...but once I saw some clothes I just moved the blinds over and walked out."" So they were clearly lying to me at the leasing office to cover their own butts. I was highly disappointed in this complex because it is such a beautiful complex but don't be fooled like I was...don't move here! Not to mention they're overpriced."
1,"Forget it. They get a negative star!
I love a good DQ cone or blizzard just as much as the next person, but a complete failure was at hand on my first visit to this particular DQ. 
Let's just say....I watched a cook with a large beard and very long hair (both uncovered) toss a uncooked frozen chicken breast someone ordered directly on a dirty counter before putting it into their cooking machine (some sort of microwave)...ah ya.

Do Not eat food here, unless you like the thrill of being poisoned. 

As for the ice cream---I have never been to a DQ where I've been told they were out of a specific blizzard mix. 
I completely understand that having multiple 16 year old kids run the store might sound great in theory for cheap easy labor, but they are ruining the franchise and spending the owner's money as I watched them give away multiple items free to a group on their friends sitting at a table in the back.

This DQ does not even deserve 1 star.

I read a review that said call the Health dept.....Seriously, someone call them!"
1,"Asked the jewler if he was able to replace the battery in my husband's Tag and he said it wouldn't be a problem.  Left the watch with him while I got a sandwich and when I came back he said he didn't actually have a battery that fit.  Since the watch was in the case and on the pillow, I didn't think to check it right there.  Turns out, he did quite a bit of damage to the back of the watch in his poor attempt at opening the back.  Worse than that is the fact that he didn't mention it at all, leaving me to discover it when it was too late to do anything about it.  I would never bring even the cheapest of jewelry to this place to repair again.  Dishonesty is not a quality you want in someone you're leaving your valuables with."
1,"This comment is directed to the gentleman that works in your Phoenix Colonnade location in the Furniture section. (The really short 80's looking guy)..

Why in the world would be so condescending to customers and butt in on their conversation? Why did you feel the need to critisize their description of a chair they were looking at?

Because of your rude and flippant behavior, and obvious lack of customer service skills you lost an extremely large sale and any future business my wife and I would ever give you. That unfortunately includes the clothing side. we refuse to give business to people that treat customers so disrespectfully !"
5,"Went to check out the Rodeside Grill for breakfast last Saturday with a group. Most of us haven't been there before but we heard good things from friends and saw the Breakfast menu online and thought we should try it out. 

Got a super warm greeting at the door and seated immediately. Had a nice dining area separate from the bar area and was clean an spacious. Our group was rather chatty so it took us a while to order but the waitress was very nice and patient. I got the Southwestern Omelet with pancakes - a little spicy but good. Others in our group got the french toast and one got prime rib and eggs. All were happy. Yummy food and good portions. 

Cost was decent - and we all got $ off for checking in on Facebook! We were very pleased and are planning on coming back again to try dinner."
1,It's called fast food. Not wait for three hours for a fricking burger food. WTF  how hard is it honestly?
1,What a joke!  It is not your average Embassy Suites.  They should really make this a Motel 6.   This place is really old and dated.  Luckily I only had an one night stay that was paid by my company.  The free breakfast is not worth it.   The AC is super loud so bring your ear plugs.
1,"Our first time here. Make sure you have 40 minutes to wait for your average tasting burger. The fries tasted like they were frozen. The good 'ole boys who seemed to be regulars, were loud and disrespectful. It's your typical dark, old and average dive bar. Let's see, something positive to say... you can apparently bring your dog. Yep. Inside. Where food is being served. Awesome."
1,I used to eat here all the time. It's been a hot minute. Today having lunch at their once great lunch buffet was horrid. The rice was dry and crunchy. The food was of poor quality. The tomato chicken tasted like beef jerky . On top of all that the services was horrid. I had to actually get up from the table and walk over to the bar were there was 5 waiters standing around and talking to ask for a refill of soda. They acted like it was such a bother and barely said two words to us. Never going back again
5,Ok this place was soo fantastic. I ordered the appetizer Sicilian garlic cheese bread. It had the perfect amount of cheese and garlic. The bread wasn't hard either just right. For my main entree I went with chicken broccoli fettuccine Alfredo. I definitely made the right choice. It tasted delicious! To top it off they include dessert with dinner. :)
1,"I wish this place were better! The only redeeming factor about this place is the happy hour. I went here yesterday just after the lunch hour and the service and food were both below average. Don't get me wrong, the hostesses were nice... when they were actually around.

I had the veggie burger and my friend had the beef brisket with bourbon sauce. Generally I find that if the veggie burger is good, the normal is bad and vise versa. However, both were terrible. My veggie burger had a terrible mush consistency and the quality of the bun was awful. My friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless. 

For the price I would expect better food... much better food. 

Honestly, they should get rid of the tables and add more beer taps. Quit the food, up the drinks."
1,"I've tried so hard after countless opportunities that you guys had just to be an acceptable go to bike shop...you've failed just about every time.  Horrible customer service countless times, jobs not performed during the time frame they had presented, which was not much of a big issue, but the fact that they never informed me that they never started the work after leaving a bike there for over three days.  I get it, you're busy.  But if you keep telling me it will be done today, I'll assume it'll be done.  If you tell me you can work on it, I'll assume you'll work on it.  And when I call to figure out what's going on, don't cut me off and expect me not to be an angry customer.  But I'm sure I get it, you're happy with your repeat customers and don't plan on getting/keeping new ones.  Thanks anyway."
5,Wonderful brunch today! I had the Sunrise sandwich and my husband had the Holy Puerco - they were both delicious. I loved the homemade biscuit - light and fluffy and not dry at all. Everyone in the staff is extremely friendly - very positive and relaxing environment. Highly recommend it!
1,"Ordered a bright, feminine bouquet with roses, Peruvian lilies, and daisies.  Received a sloppy, lopsided bouquet with no roses and no Peruvian lilies.  It looks like they took a mish-mash of leftover flowers, put it together and delivered it.  It was awful."
5,"Another one of my weekend staples. Monty's is the best diner in Madison--mainly because of their great vegetarian selection (they have a whole vegetarian SECTION...a relieving site for hungry vegetarian eyes.) My carnivorous friend are big fans of Monty's as well, so it's not for vegetarians only. I like their overall ambiance and their waitstaff is good if not great. The deserts are a MUST. Their shakes are really something to drool over, and their pies and cakes are delicious as well. Oh, and scrumptious breakfasts!"
1,"I was driving by looking for a place for lunch and I stopped in, hoping for some deli food. 

I was quite surprised to see that it's actually an old-school cafeteria. I didn't know that these places existed anymore and I was ready to be charmed.  Alas, that was not to be.

Although I came inside in the mood for pastrami, watching the staff throw together - and I mean that quite literally, I've never seen anybody, anywhere make a sandwich as quickly or carelessly - I lost my nerve and ordered the meat loaf special, thinking that was probably a better way to go in a place like this.

Unfortunately the meat loaf was dreadful as were the mashed potatoes.  Absolutely devoid of any flavor and covered in a gloppy gravy.  Seriously awful.

I see that one reviewer described it as hospital food.  That's being charitable because some hospitals actually have edible food.  It's more like what I imagine prison food to be like. 

It's also not particularly cheap.  My prison plate was $9.73 with the tax.  Not recommended."
5,"I love this place!  Was sooooo sad when I found out the Wisc Dells location closed.  So, detoured into Madison on the ride home and still got my fix of yummie fresh hot chips and salsa with a tasty strawberry marg.  Onto my fav dish, the Enchiladas seafood suiza, yum.  My fav mexican place to date."
5,My wife and her family are long term users of Los Olivos and I recently had my first experience with them.  Probably the best car wash I've been to.  Friendly service and they definitely care about doing a good job; we didn't pay for detailing but they ran my car back through the vacuum more then once to get rid of the tons of dog hair.  The owner is obviously hands on and was there overseeing things when we were there.  A locally owned independent biz I'm glad to be able to recommend.
5,"My parents live very close to the brewery/beer garden and it is so much fun to hang out there in the summer.  The garden often hosts events and fundraisers.  Sometimes there is a band or live karaoke!!  There is a neat stage and tons of picnic tables.  The brewery has a sitting area inside where the tour ends.  The tour is a good time as well!  The only downside is the lack of parking.  They have a small lot but we usually have to park on the street.

I wish this beer garden was located in warmer weather so I could enjoy it all year long!"
1,"I went to the Marling location on Stoughton road to order some kitchen parts for my small renovation project. I came prepared, bringing an extra cabinet door I had lying around as well as several photos of the crown molding to aid in identification of model numbers. Julie was the consultant who helped me. We examined the pictures and cabinet door at length, cross-referencing them against the Merillat parts catalog, until we both agreed that we had a positive match. I should mention that Julie took notes furiously throughout the process, carefully noting the product number for each item (or so I thought). Since a phone call to Merillat HQ was required to price out the order and the don't do business on weekends, she promised a follow-up call on Monday with final price information.

I got said call on Monday with final pricing. All that was left was for me to sign a contract (Julie's language, not mine) and put 50% down. I looked over the contract and verified that it contained line items for crown molding, a tall kitchen cabinet, and a spare cabinet door. I then signed and returned with a 50% down payment.

Two weeks later, as promised, I got a call that my order was ready for pickup. Upon unboxing the crown molding, I was shocked to see something that looked nothing like the molding Julie and I identified together. I immediately called Marling. Julie was apologetic but quite firm in that Marling doesn't take responsibility for ordering errors, no matter who makes them. After all, she said matter of factly, I did ""sign the contract."" Legally speaking, she's right of course.Ethically speaking, her logic is ridiculous. I'm now stuck with $150 worth of crown molding I can't use because Marling screwed up the order. What a customer service disaster. Avoid this place like the plague."
1,"This place is so slow. I got the express wash at 11am on a weekday and waited 40+ minutes for my car to be done. Wtf. 

Oh and now you must need a face or neck tattoo to work here. I didn't know if they were washing/drying my car, or figuring out how to steal it later. 

I'm not coming back here. It's not worth $5 to waste almost 45 minutes of my lunch hour.

----
I just got back to work from the place, and I noticed that 1/2 of my change/quarter pouch and all of my gum was gone. What the hell. My $5 car wash just became a $15 car wash. I called and complained, but what is it going to accomplish. Never again. I'm over this place."
5,Great service & yummy food. Enjoyed watching the game while there. Fun atmosphere!
1,"I write this review for the people who are in my position, and if you dont understand why SOME people are made to go here for petty offenses dont read this and judge because you dont understand what bullshit it is. The people who work here are cool and respectful and I understand its their ""job"" to run this place, but in reality its just another stunt by the government to rob people of their money and time. Most everyone assigned to this program cant even afford it which puts them in a even worse situation. The goverment pulls this crap cuz they know they can and piss people off more which in turn makes most situations worse. For the people who can relate for getting in ""trouble"" for the smallest thing and have to at least pay $1,500 to get something small off your record is complete shit."
1,"I was having issues with my laptop turning on, some times it would and other times it wouldn't. They were unable to figure out the problem and advised me that my computer had several viruses. Which I found odd because I had someone else already do a virus scan and they found ZERO. Data Doctors wanted me to pay a ridiculous amount of money, on top of what I paid for them to figure out the problem (which they were unable to do)  and he said its very possible that I had 250 viruses on my computer. He stated that this other expensive scan would be able to find them and then if I pay even more money then they can get rid of them. My computer was not even worth the asking price of what they wanted to fix it. I then contacted a friend and I was referred to another shop that would look at it for free....although they couldn't figure out the issue either...they told me that I have absolutely ZERO viruses on my computer. The whole thing seemed so fishy.  DD also did not finish diagnosing my computer in the time I was promised and I  had to keep calling them. They didn't even start looking at it until I was on my way."
1,Never will go again.. Food was so nasty.. Didn't  even put the flag up...
1,"I have been a regular at China Chili for over 10 years. Sadly once they moved to the new location on 3rd Street and Flower their quality has been deteriorating.  

Went recently for lunch and ordered the Mongolian Beef and Beef Foo Young and both were awful, no taste, no flavor and very sub standard.  The prices have gone up the quality is shameful.

I think that the Orange Chicken is possibly their best item right now but sadly did not have it.  Thought I would explore to other dishes but never again.

Not sure I will be back, possibly for lunch for the Orange Chicken. With so many other choices of Asian Food.. this local favorite has not kept up its quality."
1,"If the Chinese economy has a ""hard landing,"" it will look like Cofco Cultural Center. 

Most of the storefronts are empty. There's one gift store, woefully declaring ""yes, we're open!"" There are restaurants on either side of Ranch Market that may be the same restaurant with different names. The architecture is pretty in a ""Disney does China"" way, but it's essentially a strip mall with a high vacancy rate, anchored by a supermarket."
1,This place is the worst. I haven't had the best experiences here in the past but I decided to give it another try. The service has gotten worse. They told me 45 minutes for a car wash and shampoo of the seats and almost two hours later they still weren't finished. To make matters worse they took belongings out of my car and forgot to put it back in. I asked for a full refund and they said they only can only give free car washes. What kind  of customer service is that? I will not be going there ever again.
5,"I need to update my review of Blue Fin. This place absolutely rocks; that's probably why you can find me eating lunch here 4 out of 5 weekdays, seriously. I haven't ever had a bad experience here after finding this gem and cannot speak higher of everything about they provide. Service, quality and freshness of food, as well as value, cannot be found elsewhere."
5,"Best  old fashioned 5 & dime store ever! Reasonably price, helpful staff. Best framing service in town! You guys ROCK!! I've taken my kids through their childhood, then through my crafting years and now with my grandchildren. Great Store!"
5,"The best lunch in Downtown Phoenix. I always get the gyro picado with feta cheese. But great salads the offer a healthy, low fat & carb options. If you are in the area I highly recommend."
5,"Restaurant Review
Off the beaten path in Madison. I had looked up this place before on tripadvisor and was not disappointed. The restaurant itself is super small and the parking in front is rather limited (I had to drive around the block twice and realized that there was no parking in the back). Built as best BBQ in madison I was not disappointed. Fall of the bone tender ribs along with two sides was the meal I had. Get the sugar fried biscuits and you won't be disappointed. This place could be on diner and drives and I am glad I found it one my own! Also prices are super reasonable. No wonder why they won so many awards for there food. Best bbq sauce period.

Pro- Inexpensive, delicious bbq, hidden gem

Con- Small seating area, small parking, closes at 8:30 PM

Hidden deal- Order the combo to get the best bang for your buck"
5,"I can only say that it was amazing!  I am a fan, and the service was really great.  I recommend trying this place if you like authentic Thai food.  I will definitely be going back."
5,"I went to the Downtown Deli looking for a decent pastrami sandwich, and boy did I find it!  The pastrami is melt in your mouth perfect and the fries are excellent.  This has become my favorite guilty pleasure for lunch.  If you're feeling adventurous, try the Vic's Madness sandwich. Yes, I know a pastrami, egg salad, and swiss cheese sandwich sounds strange, but it's incredible.

And the best part is that the service is so fast you can get in and out for lunch quickly."
5,"We went there for the first time yesterday, and I would definitely recommend Spartan Pizza.  Here's why:
- the crust is thin, crunchy on the bottom, chewy on top
- the sauce is sweet and savory
- the cheese is rich and delicious
- the veggies were fresh and tasty

We ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think).  The Canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best I've had ... not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store.  The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that.

We also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2?  I'd bet the pizza salad is much better.

The service was casual and friendly.

In regards to the atmosphere, we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family-friendly but quite dated in appearance.  We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar.

I should also note that the plates for eating pizza are plastic.  This is a ""no frills"" kind of place."
1,"I would not recommend Joyce for bridal alterations. First and foremost, she is not friendly at all. I put on my dress for the first time since I bought it at her store, and was so excited about it. She made me feel rushed and took away from the moment. Then, she charged me $200 for bad alterations, which I ultimately took to get fixed for $100 elsewhere."
5,"Vintage guitar and amp aficionados really appreciate this place, but it probably feels alienating to people looking for beginners gear or those used to shopping at Guitar Center. These guys love what they do and love talking to you about guitar equipment. They have a variety of guitars and amps for those looking for something more unique or special than what you find at most stores.

I haven't made a big purchase there at this point, but have talked to the owner at length a few times. I botched a pickup replacement on my guitar (I'm a total electronics novice) and was planning to just take it in and pay them to fix it. But instead, they explained to me what I had done wrong and told me to try again. With their advice, I was able to install the new pickups myself without having to pay a tech. Also worth noting, I didn't even buy this gear from them and they helped me fix it."
1,"Horrible customer service. I'm shocked how they employ people who have such limited vocabulary and no common sense. Horrible attitude from the front girl ""Lucille"". Showed no effort in helping or listening to anyone. I did see her chuckle away every time she glanced at her phone. I assume her texting or Facebook was much more important than injured people seeking help. The gentleman sitting next to me has a broken finger and he's been sitting here since 11am ( 7 hours ago ). I'm heading to another hospital and giving this gentleman a ride to get seen."
5,"Amazing place with many choices~ if you are around this area, definitely stop by and get some fresh fruit as well"
1,"Six months later, I am still disgusted.  I won't eat scallops.  Thank you Biltmore for ruining a crustacean species for me."
1,"This place is slow beyond belief. How do they stay in business? I waited 15 min for my order which was wrong and cold. I got the excuse ""were short staffed"". There were two cars in line and no one in the dining area. How much staff do you need for two customers? I think they laugh about how bad they are as workers. Because they could care less...."
5,"I go to Welcome Diner so much at this point, I feel like making up disguises. It's like, c'mon, I'm JUST trying eat here everyday of my life and not feel embarrassed about it. 

The thing is, they make the best everything I've ever had anywhere.

The Bleu Burger? Omg. The Peanut Butter Bacon Burger? Literally so good, I'm pretty sure I lost IQ points. The Biscuit Sandwiches? I want to be in a Facebook-official relationship with one.

Just go here - you will understand and you will not regret it. Actually, you might regret it, because you tend to go.. no where else afterwards. Just start trying your disguises on now.

Real complaint: They only do breakfast on weekends, doesn't start till 10:30am.
More real complaint: They won't let me move in."
1,"We were starving and headed downtown for a concert and decided that BBQ ribs sounded great. I remembered that I had a an old groupon that I had bought so we decided to try it. When we first walked in it did seem a little ghetto but I know sometimes smaller places are better. We ordered a full slab Of pork ribs and 2 drinks. It came with 2 sides an with tax was about $30. My groupon was for $20 but was expired so I thought I would only get the amount I paid, $10. The only positive thing about our experience was that they honored my groupon for the full $20.

The cashier was not polite at all, not wanting to even take my groupon at first. You could tell he didn't want to be working.  Another employee was sitting in plain sight eating a large plate with no manners and looking gross. I went to get some lemonade and it tasted like water so I dumped it out and got root beer. About 10 min after we sat down they called our number but only to say that they were out of ribs! The place had 2 customers on a Friday night and the special was rib tips..but they only had chicken! They offered an extra side but no change in the price... Then while we were eating I heard another customer who had come in long after us, being old that they were out of ribs and the customer was upset that he had already paid for ribs too! I don't understand why they were letting people order and pay for ribs when it was clear they knew that they knew they didn't have any! 

When we got our meal my husband took one bite and said he hated it. the chicken was dry, bbq sauce tasted like metal and the red potato salad seemed like the kind you get in bulk at a grocery store. The fries   Were ok so thats all he ate. I liked the bbq sauce but the chicken was super dry. our friend ordered a chicken sandwich an the bun fell apart as she picked it up. She took one bite and said it was gross and didn't eat any more of it. 

If we had to pay full price I would have made a big scene but because it was a groupon and were just trying a new place I let it go but we will never go again."
5,"My friend and I went to the Science Museum and Planetarium a couple of months ago. It was awesome. We were going to see a planetarium show about meteors, but since we were the only ones in there the woman in charge, Linda, let us choose whichever show we wanted. We watched the one about black holes. Excellent. Afterwards, she talked us through what our night sky looked like and all the different constellations. Then we went on a roller coaster. Linda was the best thing about our experience. She was friendly and knowledgeable and really fun and she made our trip very unique. Everyone go now!"
5,Wonderful food! Excellent service! Great lunchtime atmosphere!
1,"Disgusting!

I've always wanted to go here because the buildings and the decor pulled me in. The food was worse than fast food. Pasta was overcooked. Broccoli tasted old, like really old. I actually considered leaving a tip and ditching the bill because I was appalled that I would have to give this minimal, barely edible restaurant money. A place like this doesn't deserve to take your money. There was absolutely no effort put in the food or service."
5,"Excellent fish tacos (including a mahi-mahi variety if you're into that).  I really like the salsa bar, not too overwhelming, just the right amount of condiments to choose from.  This place was a godsend when looking for a quick bite in downtown Phoenix.  Every other place I walked by looked really beat."
1,The WORST Best Buy I've ever been to.  I was charged $231.27 for an AMP install ... and they crossed the wiring so my right speaker was in the front left and the left speaker was in the right back ... and it kept shorting out on me.  And it sounded like compete shit (go figure) because they never played with the settings.  I went to the Manager Kevin S (he would NOT give me his last name) and he was a total unhelpful prick.  Anthony was the kid who f'ed up my install ... finally I got Keith to FIX the mess up ... Shop ANYWHERE but this store run by complete ASSHOLE PRICKS.  And what ever you do don't let Anthony touch your vehicle!
1,"This resort is beautiful. The grounds, pool, fitness center, and other amenities are amazing. If you are from snowy Chicago, Wisconsin, Minnesota and you want to getaway to beautiful Scottsdale AZ and enjoy serenity and comfort, you should consider Royal Palms Resort and Spa. Unfortunately, I had a bad experience at TJ Cooks restaurant for lunch. I ordered the flat iron steak and eggs. Except for the hash browns, the rest of the dish was INEDIBLE. I could have eaten a better meal at Denny's for a fourth of the price. I also ordered the Panini, a dessert combo of peanut butter, chocolate and bananas sandwiched inside a panini bread. This was also disappointing. My wife ordered the eggs sardou. It was cold and had no flavor but the hash brown potatoes were great. I'm hoping they had a substitute cook that day and this isn't their normal standard of taste. Again, you shouldn't miss the Resort, but I had reservations about TJ Cooks."
1,My mom drove me all the way over there yesterday and it wasn't there.  We should have checked Yelp first.  I looked on their website and it looks like there aren't any in Arizona anymore. My mom was very disappointed.
1,"I never thought I would write a one-star review of Deli Roma, but I think this once-great deli's day has passed. For the last year or so the food has been slipping and become mediocre - including, this fall, the worst plate of spaghetti I've ever been served in a restaurant (by an employee who is no longer there), but our experience on Saturday pretty much finished our long relationship with Deli Roma.

We arrived around 4:30 p.m. and there was no one else in the deli. A young man was seated behind the register and greeted us, but did not get up. We saw the specials board had an item which was a play on the Godfather, their signature Italian roast beef sandwich, and discussed whether we'd want to try it. During all this the gentleman behind the counter remained seated but appeared to be paying attention.

When I said we were ready to order he got up, but when I ordered a Godfather he said that they were out of Italian beef. I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway. The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients.

If he had, we probably would have stayed and ordered something else, but his attitude projected total, casual indifference in serving us and getting our business. If they don't want our business, we won't give it to them any more."
5,"Everyone here is very nice. You can really tell they all absolutely love animals. I called and they got my cat in the next day. They couldn't get a urine sample, so they gave me another appointment the next day for no charge. The facility is clean and up to date. I'm coming here from now on!"
1,"to start with i went with my boyfriend at 330 on 9/10/11. there were only 5 tables of people there including us. after sitting down i realized the cushion was covered in chip crumbs and lettuce, clearly they had not been wiped off. after ordering the server Joe D didnt ask if i needed a straw or lemon for my water. then my boyfriend had to wait 10 minutes to get a refill on his pepsi. when i looked around i saw Joe D standing at the bar slurping from his drink while talking to the guy behind the bar. The table next to me were served burnt chips. when we got the food my chicken was dry. this place sucks! i had been there before about 10 years ago and it was great back then. lastly this company has no comment cards anywhere in the restaurant nor do they have a way to contact the restaurant or make complaints through the website. they must not care about their customers as much as they use to. i do not recommend. if you are looking for mexican there are better places in the central/biltmore area. the only good thing was the red sauce on the chimi but not enough to get me back."
1,I live in walking distance to this place and wished it was all that and a bag of chips. Really people FIVE STARS???? seriously concerned  for where those people normally eat. This place is not even average. We have tried it 2X and just wont do it again. To be honest i cant remember what we had both times but a pasta dish was one thing and a meatball sub?? not sure. Pass on this one and go up the street to La Fontanella for a much better meal.

1,"First of all, I blame myself.  I've known for a long time that Ulta has less than desirable customer service.  I guess I am an optimist.  I really want to think they would improve their customer service over the years but sadly they have not.  From their cashiers (who are so freakin' slow and why is it there is only one ringing people up), to their less than pleasant makeup artists (unskilled and unknowledgeable about the cosmetics carried at their store compounded with inability to apply makeup).   Let me entertain you and share my most recent adventure.

As I enter the only Ulta in metro-Phoenix, I'm not greeted, and there's at least 3 sales clerks/wanna-be makeup artists I encounter as I walk thru the store to the back where they carry all the hair products.  After picking up my favorite shampoo, I decide to wander into the cosmetics department to see what's new.  One of the sales clerks (who ignored me when I entered) slowly comes up to me, notably not really wanting to help me but I guess she felt that she needed to at least ""try"" to seem like she wanted to sell cosmetics.   I play along and ask her about new shadows and blushes and what she recommends.  Since Ulta has very competitive brands, she is very politically-correct by informing me they are all wonderful.  Whatever.  Do you have an opinion?  Maybe some follow-up questions like ""What are you looking for in a product?""  ""What products do you currently use?""   Like every time before, I leave the cosmetics department empty-handed.  I'm not the typical customer that will buy a set because it comes with a little bit of everything.  That's borderline hoarding and I don't dig it.  Show me a product that works, and I'll buy it.  Give me great customer service, and I'll buy a bunch.  Simple as that people.  I'm a sucker for great customer service and will spend a lot of $$.  Ask my spouse.

So I make my way to the long line.  Long because there's only one cashier who is dealing with a disappointed customer.  Am I surprised?  No.  Am I reconsidering where I buy from the next time? Absolutely.   The customers in front and behind me are clearly just as frustrated as I.  One lady mentions, ""This is why I buy online!""  I totally agree.  So I finally make it to the cashier who doesn't greet me, just tries to sell me more magazines than I need.  I respectfully decline.  She rings up my purchases and literally throws them in a small bag.  By the time she squishes all my products in the little bag, it's bursting at the seams.  I give her my coupon (20% off my entire purchase which is the only reason why I went to Ulta in the first place) and with disdain, she runs it and makes sure she rips it into teeny tiny pieces in front of me.  What is she trying to say?  You'll never see this coupon again?  Whatever, get over yourself.  

So long story short, Uta sucks.  Especially the one at the Esplanade.  It's such a shame.  Ulta is in the business of selling beauty products and helping its customers look and feel better about themselves, which they clearly do not.  I've tried to avoid the Ulta at the Esplanade, but I have to say even the one in Ahwatukee and Chandler are almost as bad.  I get better customer service at Walmart.  That's how bad Ulta is.  Your Utra-suckly, Ulta!  I'm seriously never, ever buying from you ever again!  If I could give you zero stars I would."
1,I went to this place for a special occasion.  The waiter was noticeably trying to run the bill up.  I kept trying to keep the bill down.  It was a very strange experience.  The fish was ok but very salty.  I would not go back under any circumstances.
1,"I'm being generous - they don't deserve the star.

Because several friends recommended the G&D, I went in there once.

The place was NOT busy.  I sat down at a table.  While waiting for service, I pulled out my PDA and read the news off the net.  When I looked at my watch, and saw that half-an-hour had gone by without anyone EVER coming within 6ft. of my table -- much less asking if I wanted to order anything -- food or booze or coffee or a glass of water -- nobody.  Nothing.  I simply got up and walked out.

When I go to a restaurant, I do NOT beg for service.  I expect someone to come to my table and ask me if I want something.  They didn't do that.

Fortunately for me, there is, at least, another restaurant (there may even be two or three) in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, so I won't starve.  Altho, with that level of non-service, the G&D might."
5,"Banner Good Sam is the best hospital by far in Phoenix and trust me I've probably been to almost every hospital in the phx area! The nurses are outstanding they are always nice,happy and attentive! The doctors well I couldn't ask for better doctors they keep me informed on all my treatments and health care! Hospital is very clean and very nice. I would and have recommended this hospital to any of my friends and family! The only hospital I go to now!!"
1,"I shan't be returning.

Their festive signage caught me on the way to another venue for lunch, and I thought ""why not Chinese?""  I'll tell you why; or at least, why not to select this buffet.

Being greeted on the way in with a ""You are on camera"" sign sure is welcoming.  I was quickly greeted, though, and directed to my seat.  My drink order was taken before I even sat down, which was nice.  Too many buffets have you walk in, sit down, select a beverage, stand up, and proceed to self-service, and it was nice to save a couple of steps.

But then I got to the food.  Nearly everything had the congealed look of having been out too long; the skin on the surface of the sweet-and-sour sauce was rubbery and at least a half-centimeter thick.  Not exactly appetizing.  I did, however, find some acceptable-looking specimens and returned to my table.

The warmest of the foods could only generously be called lukewarm; most of the chicken was marbled with glibbery wads of fat, and all the sauces tasted sugary and generic.  I could literally not tell the ""orange chicken"" from the ""sesame chicken"" from the ""pepper chicken"" by any sense other than sight.

The rice was room-temperature, but I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me).

The fruit selection, which I also sampled, looked fine, but was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm.

They have a somewhat vast dessert selection -- particularly for a buffet -- but I'd more than had my fill.

Walking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted.  There were three more similar signs at the register/gift shop (!).  Again, very welcoming.

I won't be back, unless I'm told they're under new management."
5,"you know that feeling of wanting to try something new and not wanting to settle for good-but-typical restaurants when you're visiting an area? This place does the job for a good price.

for it being a specialty sandwich shop (i.e. serving duck), it has reasonable prices (~$8.75) for their signature The Duckling sandwich, which is a like a thanksgiving sandwich with roasted duck breast (Turkey + roasted duck breast + cranberry and walnut relish + cream cheese).  MIND BLOWN. their bread is so soft. its like having pillowfuls of flavor in your mouth.

fresh ingredients, so good.

My friend had the Brieciutto sandwich (prosciutto, brie, sun-dried tomatoes + champagne mustard) the salty from the prosciutto (which, btw, was of excellent quality; not the waxy, can't-chew-through kind of prosciutto) and the sweet from the tomatoes and brie makes it pretty darn good.

they also have so many gourmet snacks, bakery items and sweets on the counter, for the after lunch sweet tooth craving to seal it deal. but what I thought was the winner was their selection of bite-size gourmet cheesees (~$1.50 each) for you to sample with your lunch. I got 3: the Marble, triple creme blue, and the Prima Donna Gouda. if you care, here's the verdict: the marble was surprisingly the most pungent of all. triple creme was the winner, it being creamy and just the right amount of oomph. prima donna gouda was meh. fancy cheese without the price tag commitment? oh yes pls. 

p.s. why is it so hard to spell prosciutto correctly?"
5,"Since living in Austin I've become addicted to Topo Chico sparkling water.  Pros RM  is the only store in valley that carries it.  Good luck finding it there now too because I buy it all when I go! Ha!  Also, it an awesome mexican market too"
5,Ok I know my review is a bit late but oh well :) . I came in here when I visited Arizona when the LA Dodgers played the Diamondbacks back in April of this year. This place was cool! I had the big unit and it was soo delicious! I would definitely recommned this place.
1,"Well, let's begin with the owners son who made my pregnant wife feel like a complete idiot.  We don't know anything about accounting, that's why we hire an accountant.  Then we are asked to put down a $300 retainer like they don't trust we'll pay the money to get the work done.  Then once retainer is paid, we are put on the backburner and ignored and sent bills for over $1000 over the next few months just to get our year end taxes done!  Then we ask to have help closing the business out with the government and are made promises that everything will be completed.  Now 6 months later, my wife had every penny (thousands) taken from her account by the state because nothing was ever done and the state is still charging my wife Unemployment Insurance taxes ($2000+) that she doesn't actually owe because the business was closed in February!  Guess what, Sorge said they'd fix it for us if we paid a $300 retainer again!"
1,Went in today for a bagel an cream cheese. I used to always get a sun dried tomato bagel and today I found out it's discontinued. :( I will not be coming back anymore.
5,"I crave Zoe's when I'm in the mood for something light and fairly healthy. I love their chicken salad and tuna salad. Both are pretty much just meat, mayo, and salt/pepper/spices, I think. No onions and no mustard make me a happy chicken/tuna salad eater! I also love their pimento cheese, feta slaw, and potato salad. The chocolate cake, though, is what hooked me onto Zoe's in the first place. It is basically a Texas sheet cake - moist, not too overpoweringly chocolatey, with that boiled fudge frosting that soaks in and seals in the goodness of the cake. {Droooool}"
5,N E W   S E A T S !!!!  The old bench were terrible and kept us away.  We spent two games this year and we are hooked.
1,"Sad...sad...sad....what happened, this place was once cool, I give it a few more months and it will be offices or ghostown, I think one the reasons people do not go there, paying for parking is just not cool anymore..it cost me $12 bucks..and when talked to the attendant just for an explanation...he acted like he just did not give a shit!! That will be my last time there, and as far as recommendations to friends and family...forget it!! Too quote a famous movie ""Iceberg ahead!!"""
5,"Fantastic southwest food! You want something fresh, tasty, and reasonably priced go to Canyon Cafe! The canyon classic burger is perfect! Cheddar jalapeño bun can't be beat!! Guacamole made to order right in front of you! Can't beat that!"
1,"The ideal customer for this store is someone who is heavily armed and who has the patience of Ghandi. You would need both to safely navigate the waters of this disastrous store.

This is the nearest grocer for downtown residents, and it is sad that this store misses the mark by such a huge margin.

On any day, the parking lot is covered in grease, coffee, and trash. IF by some miracle you are able to get inside without being hit up for money by tweakers, then the heavens are smiling on you.

Once inside the store, your adventure is just starting. The characters inside the store are the inspiration for the bar scene in Star Wars. Very random and sketchy. As far as the contents of the store, to be fair they have all the stuff you need, and at a reasonable price point.

The huge problem here, is everything else. During peak hours, they have very few lanes open, that is a consistent failure with this store. Customer service is also dead here, and they just don't know how to take care of customers. I feel as though the broken window theory is at play here. It seems like because they don't take care of the parking lot, and other details, the whole place goes to hell. The store also has a serious shoplifting problem. I'm not sure if they just don't staff the loss prevention unit, or if they are inept, but I have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief. It makes for an unsafe situation for everyone. They do have private security there, and the guys seem really nice, but clearly in over their heads. At this point the store is so far gone, they really need off-duty police officers to make it safe.

It really seems like this store just doesn't give a shit. At each opportunity to impress, the complete opposite happens. This place is a huge safety problem, and I would hate to have my sisters or Mom go to this place, it's really that shady. See for yourself, but be on your toes."
5,"Ok, so I had been scouting this place out for a while, mainly because it looked like such a dump and was located next to a bus stop.  I finally stopped in a couple months ago and it was... really tasty!  Don't let the shack-like appearance of this place fool you - it's damn good mexican food.  Best I've had in the Downtown area actually.  I definitely recommend the ""gorditas,"" which actually taste a lot like what Taco Bell call chalupas.  Sort of a thick, buttery, fried taco.  Good stuff"
1,"I refuse to eat at a restaurant where you stole 98% of your menu from another restaurant and just changed the names!  Shame.

Wish I could give zero stars"
5,"I totally heart the Welcome Diner because:

There are 7 seats. Maybe 8. (inside)

The cook (Andy?) is super friendly and apologizes if it takes more than mere moments to get your food.

The Garfield fried egg sandwich will knock your little socks off.

If the Garfield knocks your socks off, then the french fries with onions and peppers will knock everything off you, leaving you happily, nakedly enjoying you food.

And because there are only really like 5 menu items. Eggs somehow, hamburgers somehow, hot dogs somehow, french toast in a cup (what? yes) , and some other thing maybe. 

Normally I hate cash only, but this gets a pass. It seems right to pay cash."
1,Unbelievably bad experience.  Not only is the woman behind the counter the rudest person I have ever met in my life she refused to answer a simple question. Anyone should be able to tell you what the estimated time frame for ground shipping us. Is it 12 days or 21 she had to be given an explanation of what I was asking.  I will be using FedEx to ship anything just yo not have to deal with her again.
5,"Mmmmmmmmmmm!  I came here with a group for a birthday celebration, and the weather was just perfect for patio seating.  We started off with some Thai beers, trying out a couple of recommendations, and a variety of starters.  That was the easy part, picking something to eat was a terribly hard decision, everything looked amazing.  

Lucky for us, with 5 people, everyone picked something different.  I had the best Beef Panang EVAR!  The mix of curry and coconut was perfect....all the flavor, and the heat came, but after you tasted it on every inch of your tongue.  The jasmine rice was the perfect base for the sauce, and the beef was perfectly cooked.

I love curry and spice, but I want to taste the food too, and they gave me all of the heat and all of the flavor.  For my mom, who can't eat spicy stuff, they had enough options, and she was thrilled to get something that tasted great.

Most of the people we were with have been to Thailand, and they all agreed that this was very authentic.

They even brought out a nice traditional, homemade ice cream dessert for the birthday boy - which we all shared.

Everything I tried, I liked and I really need to go back and try more of their menu...I think I could go frequently and not get bored!  I just wish it could hit them up on my lunch.

They are also right off the light rail line, which makes it much easier for a Chandler girl to get to - no worries about traffic or parking."
5,"The service from beginning to end was top-notch! Our car was swiped by a semi and took out our passenger side mirror. Abra treated us with respect and professionalism through the entire process. They did a fantastic job fixing our car and didn't overcharge us for anything. 

We'd recommend Abra to anyone!"
1,"My husband got the worst haircut ever today from Jackie. Right off the bat she started shaving his head too close and too high on the sides and then cut it way too short on top. When my husband said ""This isn't what I asked for"", Jackie's response was ""This how I normally do it"". No apology or effort to make it right, and then proceeded to charge full price. Will definitely never be back."
5,"So I was visiting Arizona for spring training baseball and pining for a decent meal when we stumbled across Welcome Diner.  This place friggin' rules.  All of the food that our party tried--duck burger, breakfast biscuit, creole breakfast--was off the chain.  And they service beer, which is perfect for a Sunday brunch.  

The staff was friendly and the service excellent.  They take pride in their craft, and you can see why when you taste the food.  If you're looking for a place to get some soul-nourishing food with a soulful flare, this is the place for you."
5,"Wow... Loved this place.  When I walked in and saw the menu, I didn't know what to get.  I've had some great Thai food in California so I was craving something good.

I really wanted a shrimp entree, but they only had seafood entrees.  I asked our waiter, Nathan, who was very pleasant, and he had a great suggestion.  He was able to customize a dish for me that I loved.  Fried shrimp with yellow curry, Thai vegetables, and jasmine rice.  He called it Crispy SH M.K.  No idea what that means but when I return that's how I'm supposed to order it.  The vegetables consisted of eggplant, Thai pumpkin, and green beans.  It was spicy, but I loved it.

For an appetizer, we had the satay sampler with shrimp, beef, and chicken. The satay sauce was delicious.  And, of course, a glass of Thai iced tea.

Prices were very reasonable and the portions were large - about $45 for two entrees, drinks, and an appetizer.  Can't wait to go back!!"
5,"This place is amazing. A friend brought me here when I was visiting from out of town and I was really impressed. This may be my new favorite Thai food place. They have a ton of creative options on the menu that look delicious. When I told the waiter I was a vegetarian, he said that they could make 90% of things vegetarian. I asked whether that included using beef broth and fish sauce and he clarified that they use vegetarian broth and a veggie substitute for the fish sauce for all of the veggie dishes. Amazing! I got a delicious noodle dish that I'm now craving again. My friend got peanut chicken and sticky rice with mango, both of which looked delicious. I would definitely recommend this place."
5,I love this place! It's family owned and operated (still!) and is old-timey like most places aren't anymore! For a yummy feel-good blast from the past meet me at Three Sisters! :-)
1,What a cluster and a fiasco to get I to a class...people have old passes and different passes which mess up the number of people for the class. 3 of is tried to go to cycle class and didn't get a bike even with a pass and our name on the list. This is the worst location in the valley. I drove 10 mikes to get here...thanks for nothing you guys! I'm sticking to scottsdale. Just wish they had more options for cycle...
5,Good food. Great service.  Ask for Waitress Aimee ~ she was friendly and professional.
1,"Horrible service and bland, tasteless food!"
5,"I brought my 2004 VW Golf in to have the AC repaired. The car was not purchased at Zimbrick and I had hoped the repair would be covered by the extended warranty. The problem my car was having turned out to be somewhat of a mystery, solved on day two by the shop foreman. I greatly appreciated that they were willing to work with the third party warranty company, kept me informed, provided me with a ride to and from work and then a loaner car. Also, I appreciate that the loaner car was a VW ;)"
5,Deli Roma- Great Italian deli.  Large portions.  Sandwich meats are slice to the order.  Perfect tiny dining room with plastic red and white checkered table cloths.  Soooo good. Go there.  Eat!
1,"The owner was completely unprofessional, called me stupid repeatedly and tried to charge me a fifty dollar fee for adding water to my radiator. I wouldn't go here again if he paid me!  It was the most ridiculous attempt to get money for doing nothing that i have ever seen. In top of that he tried to charge
 me almost two hundred for an oil change and adding coolant. What a crook!"
1,"Awful has a new name.  Hillstone.  Just awful; service food...the whole thing.  Food was cold and poor quality.  Service, they just didn't care.  A tab of $187 one would assume you would get mediocre service but nope. I recommend taking your money elsewhere."
1,"Waited over 40 minutes for a half-pound of dry ground beef; nothing ""BBQ"" about the BBQ Western burger. If the rest of the menu is the same quality, no wonder they need girls in shorts and tank tops to get customers!"
5,I took my gf here before a Suns game. The server was very knowledgeable.  The cheese plate was great but a bit pricey.  Some salad w/ fruit and boiled chicken was tasty according to the princess. Bleu cheese mac n cheese was amazing. Go eat here tonight.
5,"I have always loved this place and everyone I bring here loves it too. I go at least once a month and never had any problems. Really cool stuff to look and the merchandise is fun too.

The staff is usually friendly and the prices aren't too high. This is the only place I can find really good smoked meat!"
5,"I just went here for the first time and wow I can't believe I have overlooked it for so many years!  We tried all the hot items, the beef brisket, pork shoulder, and the ribs. I'd highly recommend all of them. Even if you are eating alone-you deserve it. This is America-Treat yo' self!

As a man who loves attending the local barbecues I can say this place is BBQ to the core. If you are serious about barbecue you best get over here. After one visit, I already plan to stop in or get takeout whenever I drive by the airport.



Side note: I love Famous Dave's Barbecue, but saying Smoky Jon's is inferior in anyway is laughable. The only reason I will ever again choose Famous Dave's over Smoky Jon's is because I am not in Madison.

Secondary note: you can pick up their sauce at Woodman's to put on everything."
1,"This hotel is horrible!! The customer service has to be as old as the hotel because they have no understanding of what is like to treat a customer correctly! The front desk has attitude, the valet are airheads and the overall atmosphere just sucks! I regret ever staying here and would like to advice anyone on thinking about staying here to STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!! Rooms are small bathtubs have roaches, paint is chipping off the walls.... Ugh just a bad experience! I paid 178 for one night and regret it! I've stayed at motel 6 that are way better than this!"
5,"Hate the wait, but love the place all the same.  Great, great food and convenient to Olbrich Gardens."
1,"Not going to waste too much time on this review because it was so awful. Bottom line, unless your name is Gordon Ramsay, do not step foot in this restaurant. Our service was fine, but the food was undercooked (they breaded the halibut!??!?), mushy, and tasted several days old. This experience would have been forgettable and/or forgiveable if they weren't also charging $35/plate for the halibut ""special"". There are so many other restaurants nearby that charge less for a much better food experience. Bottom line, avoid Avanti."
1,Tasty when they haven't run out of food on the buffet. Dirty and full of roaches. I wish I had taken my can of Dow Bathroom Cleaner to spray on the mens room door. Health department says they've take legal action. The employees sit at the bar and drink and talk on cell phones and watch t.v.
1,Good was ok. Not as good as it had been. Lots of mistakes by the server. Why are there screaming kids in the bar??
1,Gays may or may not be admitted. Depends on the front desk clerk.
5,"Visited between lunch and dinner:  Fast and friendly service.  Far better menu than IHOP or Denny's.  Meal combos ""Trio"" (limited time only?) are fantastic because you get a slice of your choice of pie.  Unbeatable bargain because the food is fresh, very tasty, in what I consider nice sized portions and the pie was included...otherwise a slice of pie cost around $4 by itself!  Saved room for the pie and took my left over meal to go.  Will definitely visit this or any Coco's location again."
1,Overpriced Hawaiian food
5,"A great place for plant lovers any time of the year!

My wife and I come here every winter (if we can) to attend a conference put on by Horticulture Magazine(Fine Gardening).  Olbrich does a nice job with preparation, including the food.

Their tropical conservatory is a bit on the small side but the building and plants are very well tended.

The various gardens are very well tended.  There are 10 or more theme gardens.  I love their rose garden:  YES WE CAN GROW BEAUTIFUL ROSES IN WISCONSIN.  In fact some roses have been developed by a hybridizer at Olbrich.

Olbrich is in a nice area of Madison - close to Lake Monona."
1,"One star reviews are really rare for me, So much so, that, if I am giving a one star review, I will usually just not even bother to write the review. 

Coach and Willie's probably deserves better, but for what we paid and the quality of food we got, I have to do what I have to do.  Here goes...

We had been given tickets to the Diamondbacks game and, not too familiar with the area, this was the first place we found. The game was starting in a little over an hour when we showed up. Even at that, we did not get bad service, the one star is primarily directed at the food, which was not good.

I get very dismayed when something on the menu sounds really good and is such a disappointment. I ordered the Baja Fish Wrap. I love fish tacos and this sounded like something in the same vein. They do give you a choice of sides. I chose the wedge salad. The fish was bland. The lavosh wrap around it was soggy and falling apart. The menu promised spicy sauce... again bland. The wedge salad was a travesty. It was just an unwieldy wedge of lettuce with a small amount of dressing on it. It took up over half the plate. When you tried to cut it it made everything slide off the other side. I gave up on it after the first few bites. It wasn't worth the work and mess. My wife had a nearly identical experience with her tequlila-lime chicken wrap... no flavor at all in any of the food.

These sandwiches and two drinks cost us over $50. Hence, one star. We won't be going back here."
5,"I've been wanting to find a good Salvadorean place in Phoenix and this place is it!  We went there on a whim for dinner, along with three friends and everyone hands down loved the place.  Its clean, comfortable and charming;  the menu is varied, with foods from El Salvador, Mexico, the Caribbean and even a few american style items.  The service is friendly, helpful, and didn't try to hurry us up.  
My husband had the steak and onions, and it was excellent. We all shared several pupusas, which everyone loved.  And shared a fried plantain with beans and cream and it was delicious!  My vegitarian friend had the Fried Yuca (w/out the pork), and she loved it. 

My husband is puerto rican and is very picky about restaurants, and had been resistant to trying Salvadorean food for a while - but this is now one of his favorite new hole-in the walls in Phoenix. We will be going back often!"
1,"What a disappointment! I had been wanting to come here for months. The service was embarrassingly bad. Despite the empty tables, there were 3 different groups waiting at least 15
minutes to be seated. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be looking around for their waiter/waitress and looking generally displeased. We requested one of the several tables outside and were told by the surly hostess that we couldn't...because the tables were dirty (and she didn't want to clean them, presumably?). Our drink order was taken and then a clueless waiter came back to re-take it. When he returned, he'd already forgotten my drink order and had to go back the bar to make it. We then saw two of the servers get into an argument in front of us. 

Every table is supposed to get bread and we asked several people for ours when after 30 minutes, we still didn't have it. One waitress even told us, ""I'm sure it's baking right now."" No offer to check on it, no apologies, nothing. 30 minutes and 2 cocktails later, we looked at the group of disgruntled patrons and decided we would rather take our business elsewhere."
5,exceptional customer service!!!  The cashier was very patient and friendly as well ! great menudo!
1,"I'm not sure why I even tried giving this business another shot. What a waste of time. 

They advertise for window tinting, so my husband and I decided to go in for a quote and possibly schedule a time to do it. We asked for a price quote from the counter and with the price and the brand of tint they use, we were happy and decided to schedule a time immediately. At that point, the lady at the counter said she needed to call the guy that did the tinting. [sketch moment #1]

She called and he was apparently able to come in immediately, which at that point was fine, we just needed to run our last errand before we got stuck there for several hours. As we were leaving, we were informed that we had to pay in cash, and couldn't use a card because this individual doesn't actually work for the car wash......we explained that we didn't have cash on us, and the lady at the counter kept insisting that we could just go get some cash. [sketch moment #2]

After we left, we had gotten such a bad vibe from that, we decided to not go along with the appointment and immediately called to cancel. During that phone call I explained that we were no longer to to get the window tint (this was within 5 minutes of us leaving there) and THEN, she tells me that they CAN take a card for payment! 

What the hell kind of business are you running? They also claim to have a warranty on the tint, but if the jobs are being completed by someone who doesn't even work for the car wash, who is in charge of covering any type of warranty? NEVER AGAIN. This isn't breaking bad, stop trying to do shady work."
5,"Allow me to express my undying love for New Orleans Take-Out. 

I lived in Madison almost 8 years ago and have yet to find another shrimp po' boy even remotely close to the delicacy at NOTO. It's one of those hole in the wall places that looks scary and not hygienic on the outside but is completely amazing and totally worth it. 

I remember the first time my dad took me for a ""sandwich as big as yo head."" I had just taken the ACT as a 6th grader and afterwards all I was really capable of was mumbling simple sentences. I remember being surprised that dad wasn't kidding, the sandwich really was as big as my head. And that it was like, really awesome. My fam were instantly regulars.

8 years and 3 citites later, the search continues. I'm not even asking for a better sandwich (I don't think one exists), but one that's just as good (it seems like that doesn't exist either).

Oh and if this review sounds similar to the one by Sheena F. it's because she's my sister. It's a family obsession."
5,"Disclaimer: I've only used union cab when I've made a telephone booking 24 hours in advance.

I've been in a union cab for about 4 round trips in the last year. Every time I've called ahead and scheduled, the respective cab drivers have either been there 5 minutes early or on time. I've never had a rude driver, and each driver was really helpful with heavy luggage at the airport. They are not as cheap as the share-ride cabs (like badger), but I felt a lot safer and more comfortable in a union cab."
1,"These guys are crooks. Shop manager there said I needed a new tire and that another guy was going to come in an tell me about options available. Guy B comes in and says oh you need 2 tires so let's get some prices. I said your shop manager just said I needed one. ""Well I recommend 2."" I'll do with 1 thank you. Guy B says oh you're just in luck I have XYZ Brand tire for $108 per tire... I drive a PT CRUISER! I could get all 4 tires BRAND NEW up the street at they're competitors shop without hassle for $75 more. Why the hell would i pay that for 1?! This place is a joke."
5,Pretty good thai food. I have been here twice and enjoyed the curry dishes very much. Great quality food and perfectly prepared. Service is always prompt and friendly - great place for lunch and dinner.
5,"Definitely loved coming here and learning about all the different Native American cultures. I would recommend taking the guided tour as I learned so much more than if I had wandered around by myself.

They have a nice shaded courtyard with a cafe and two shops"
5,"The opticians and optometrists at Isthmus Eye Care are so friendly and helpful. I recently had an eye exam and contact fitting here, and it was a great experience. Not a huge fan of having my pupils dilated, but they put some drops in afterward which was supposed to help the dilation go away faster. Dr. Maursetter was very nice and explained the purpose of all the tests she was running. It's always helpful when a professional is explaining what they are doing instead of just doing something and leaving you wondering why they are doing it. She gave me some daily contacts to try since I had complained of dryness with the two week contacts. After wearing those for a week, I decided I did not like them so they gave me a different brand to try on. They are very accommodating of your needs, and ordering contacts from them is quick and easy."
1,"Just thought I should update and mention that well over a year later, the $90 brake job held up just fine. I eventually sold the car, which had 300,000 miles on it, but the brakes never did become a problem again.  Though the owner claims that I couldn't have POSSIBLY fixed them for $90, it does appear that I most certainly did.  Well, me, my dad, Auto Zone and Chiltons."
1,Worst wait staff and management i have ever experienced in my life!!! Kinda feels like a retirement home.
5,"Been here twice now and I really like this place!  Great healthy choices for lunch and it is not that expensive.  Both times I have come I have had the My Sherry A'more it is grilled chicken, white onions, button mushrooms, and fresh baby spinach sauteed in a robust sherry sauce, with diced roma tomatoes, jasmine rice, and feta cheese wrapped in a tomato basil tortilla... YUMMY!  This is going to be one of my regular lunch places now.  Also they have a strawberry lemonade that I am sipping right now that is so refreshing!"
5,"I love this place. It is right down the street from my house and I stop in there several times a week. Everyone there knows me and has what I usually purchase on the counter before I even walk in. Amazing customer service, great options for beer, wine and even produce. It is so much easier and better than circle k or anything else around since it is smaller and I don't have to wait in a 20 minute line."
5,"Wow! I headed to Mi Amigo's with a group of friends in search of amazing (and cheap) margaritas. What I found was a restaurant that serves up $2.50 margaritas (the ""blue amigo"") and has amazing food! You HAVE to try the Chile Relleno. Seriously. It was the best Mexican dish I've ever had! Definitely check this place out when in Phoenix!"
5,Some of the best BBQ I have ever had.  Found this place when I was looking for a place to grab dinner on a quick evening flight up from Chicago.  It's super close to the airport and the food is outstanding.
1,"If you want to go and get harassed by the regular that goes there everyday,  this is it! Not, only, that but having the bartender support  him, telling you to get the ""f"" out of hid seat! Patti( the bartender)  continued to serve the man alcohol even after he appeared to have had a few before coming out! I tried calling the owner who i never ended up hearing from. I will let everyone know about my horrible experience I had, considering I live in monona!"
1,"If Kurt Cobain had been here in the summer time, he would have sang ""Smells Like Athlete's Foot."" Thank goodness, he lived in the Northwest.

This 24-Hour Fitness, especially the men's locker room, is disgusting. I took a shower once after a good workout and I had to count the years from my last tetanus shot. Filthy, shaky, rusty partitions in the shower. 

The rest of the gym has an ""I love the 80's"" vibe. It's one pastel short of a Richard Simmons' color scheme. There were gym rats who perspire so much at stationary bikes that sweat drips from the machine and forms a pool on the floor. If you have an over-active sweat glands, please have the courtesy to wipe. 

Worst of all, on my fourth (and last) visit, a petty thief broke my locker and stole all my cash. I reported the incident, filled up a form, and got valuable advice: ""Don't use combination lock, it's easy to break."" 

Ummm...really? When some gym members have bolt cutters instead of fitness gloves, it's time to move on to a different gym."
1,"Yes, the reviews are right.

1) Hotel needs updated
2) Shuttle is slow, took me an hour to get to the hotel because of a ""shift change"".  One guy was waiting at the hotel so long he missed his flight
3) Fitness room is lacking at best"
1,"TERRIBLE!!!!!!

I have been in the state for 4 months and this is the WORST restaurant choice we have made so far. I had a bad feeling and should have listened to my instinct. Wasted $40.

Let me start by saying the host/hostess were the nicest staff at the place. 

My husband ordered the 7 oz sirloin with riblets, seasonal vegatables and mashed potatoes. The sirloin was mostly fat and rubbery. There was no meat to be eaten. It was just a hunk of fat. The riblets even had a weird smoke flavor that he compared to cigarette smoke. We do not go places looking for an all smiles server, but this guy did not smile and when he saw we were not enjoying our meal and my husband's plate was still full, he did not even ask if the food was okay or if there was something he could do. We don't like to complain and just were not in the mood to even let him or the manager know. I really did not expect the food to be so bad. I will stick to TGIFridays, Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse from now on;they never disappoint and we have no problem putting down $50 or $60 plus a $10+ tip. For the same $40 spent, we could have gotten a meal we actually enjoyed. The only good part was my daughter's chicken fingers, fries and pepsi. Sad. We will not be returning. For such a nice ""looking"" exterior, you would think they'd have more quality food and servers. I guess you get what you pay for..sadly.

Do not go here! We will be voiding it like the plague."
5,"I am a little biased - I worked in a library all through high school and into college. I also love books, I own A LOT of them, ask my husband, he just moved them all. So, I really haven't met a library I haven't liked, but the Sun Prairie library is top notch. Having recently re-located to the Sun Prairie area one of the places I really wanted to check out was the library. It did not disappoint. Here are the aspects of it that really stuck out to me: 
The snack shop - what a great idea! Who doesn't lose track of time at the library and need a little refueling? 
The ceilings and overall structure - very elegant. 
The staff - always kind and helpful. Not the stereotypical librarian who constantly shushes you. 
Plenty of places to sit and read undisturbed, unless you have children that is. 
The children's area. 
Screened in porch 
Plenty of activities and programing 
Reservable community rooms"
1,"If you've ever wondered what it would be like to attempt to sleep on the infield of the Indy 500, while the race is in progress, and you don't care to spend the money on race tickets, just book a room at this hotel.
The property is immediately, I mean immediately adjacent to the infamous ""Beltline"" highway, and the sound attenuating properties of the windows are non-existent. 
I thought the heavy curtains that frame the sheer might help to reduce the mind numbing highway noise.  But guess what, they're decorative only and can't be closed.
I spent $65/night through Price Line, and that was about $50 too much.
A few annoyances, in addition to the brain gelatinizing cacophony:

1) What the hell is with the 30 lbs. down duvets that these hotels seem to think add a half star to their rating?  They're excessively hot on all but the coldest nights, they weigh a freaking ton, and when they end up on the floor (as is always my deal) you have nothing left but the thread bare, pallid, dirty sheet. Which isn't enough.

2) Setting the alarm clock requires an advanced degree in electrical engineering.  Seriously, you really expect people to use these pieces of junk? Which leads me to annoyance number 3:

3) When I tried to use the dirty, circa 1981 phone to set my wake up call, and I successively pressed all four of the ""At your service"" buttons I got nothing.  I messed around with the phone for 15 minutes before I finally reached a guy working in the bar (I could never hope to duplicate this feat).  He was kind enough to transfer me to the front desk.

4) I was going to use the in-room coffee maker but it had been filled, at some point, with sour smelling water.  On my worst day of caffiene deprivation, I wouldn't have used that disgusting and antiquated little machine.

A flat screen TV and a weighty down (or down substitute, as it where) duvet do not make a 3.5 star hotel! This place needs a major capital infusion.  Thank you for your time."
5,"I used Downtown Deli today for a catering order. A year ago a client had brought us these amazingly good sandwiches, I had a ham sandwich on a Kaiser roll. I was so thrilled because I love a good ham sandwich, the ham and bread are they key elements! 
I decided to use Downtown Deli for a client seminar we had since the food was good and the box lunch is nicely prepared. 
When I placed the order, Glenn asked me how I heard of them and I raved over the ham sandwich! I was pleasantly surprised to see a box lunch right on top with my name and inside was a ham on Kaiser just for me! The oatmeal cookie was nice and soft and well appreciated for the mid-day snack crave! Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and on-time delivery!"
1,"We had two waitresses for our table of 8, each only did a section of the table but service was very bad. From our three drinks ordered, we only got two. It was pricey. We won't be coming back."
5,"A museum about the indigenous people of North America, or Native Americans. This place is very well put together, there are people that are able to answer your questions. Their knowledge is vast about Native Americans. I would definitely revisit this place over and over again."
5,I always try and get here at least once when I go to Madison.  The food is always good.  I love the tofu scramble.  A great mix of traditional diner food with some great healthy alts.
5,I recently had a birthday and as part of the celebration my partner ordered a cake from Scot's. The cake was beautifully decorated and tasted delicious. I would highly recommend them for any of your dessert needs! I should also mention we split a cookie and it was fantastic as well!
5,"If you are looking for local culture, this is it. As a recent transplant to Phoenix, I really enjoyed my visit to the museum and learned a lot about the local Native American cultures. This is also a must visit when people visit you in Phoenix. What I especially love about this museum is that it presents the Native American cultures as living, breathing peoples and not in a museum/""under glass"" sort of manner. There is a lot of information here, and it is presented clearly and coherently."
5,"Our neighborhood, locally-owned sushi place and NOT a chain (as someone suggested in another review). I had to weigh in because we have been going to Ichi Ban for 7 years and the owner, Seth, and his staff have been consistent, attentive and friendly. And the sushi is fresh, creative and tasty in my opinion. Order something off the ""specials"" menu posted on the wall and you can't go wrong with the spicy tuna. It also isn't as expensive as other sushi restaurants and there are other menu options for land lovers. Great sushi place for lunch or dinner and right on the light rail."
5,"Just awesome. The biscuits are buttery, the chicken is juicy. The food is simple, done well, and delicious; plus it's minutes from our house. 
Can't wait to come back to try something else!"
5,I think I hugged Duane two times today! We just did our taxes through Beckett Tax and my husband and I couldn't have been happier with the results! I would recommend him in a heartbeat. All of these other reviews are so true. He made taxes fun (who knew?!) and made the numbers (that feel like a foreign language to me) easy to understand. Awesome!
5,"I am the owner of a Jaguar and a Range Rover so it goes without saying that next to my wife and kids, my mechanic is the next most important person in my life. After moving to Phoenix I followed the rule book and took my cars to the local Jaguar / Land Rover dealers for repair and service. A friend of mine recommended Virgina Auto Service to me a few years ago when he was visiting me in hospital as i was recovering from the shock of a $4000+ repair on my Range Rover. (just joking but it wasn't far off)

The next time I needed a service thats exactly where I headed - and I have been heading there ever since. The owner Matt Allen is a champion. Aside from being a terrific guy, he as honest as the day is long and I know if he tells me I need to get some work done, it needs to be done. Likewise he is always looking to keep the repairs and service in check and takes as much pride in saving me money as he does in the work his shop performs.

I am not a happy customer - I'm a fan. These guys do business the way it should be done, they treat their customers the way you hope people would treat you and most of all I always feel I get value and peace of mind for my money.

I highly recommend this shop."
5,"We attended this month's third Friday N+U event (free) at the Heard and it was a blast! This month, it was Capoeira and African drumming/dancing with an open bar and margaritas/street tacos in the cafe. The event was entertaining, full of energy and my 3 year old and I danced for almost an hour. My margaritas certainly didn't hurt! I had a great time and I am really looking forward to September's event, jewelry and drinks!"
1,"I've always wanted to try this place, but after going here today for lunch it will be my last time. First of all, impression is everything to me. The cashier was rude and I'm not sure if she even knew how snappy and rude she was to everyone. Some of the workers didn't look too happy to be working today which totally messed up my mood. I had the BBQ chicken sandwich and it was moist but not seasoned. The cashier ruined my experience and management needs to check her attitude!

Also, the volume on the radio needs to be turned down in the back. If you're waiting for your number to be called you can just forget about hearing them."
5,"Best Jamaican food in the whole state!! And they're even FROM Jamaica! How's that for authenticity! It's a family run business and I got that sense of family by just eating there.

Unfortunately I moved from Madison and my tummy cries for their food all the time! Whenever I am in town though, I stop there --especially for their all you can eat buffet on Fridays. They get kinda nervous when I walk in because I eat all their food. I can't help it! It's all so tasty. They use the perfect amount of seasonings and their meat, like their chicken and ribs, is so succulent meat falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. Plus it doesn't have that ""chain restaurant"" type feeling. You go in there, you eat great food and they let you enjoy yourself.

When they first opened, I asked the owners why they didn't open up other locations because their food was so darn good. And they said they didn't want to get too big and compromise the food. That kind of dedication in what they do really spoke to me. It spoke to my belly too.

Pineapple Salmon--awesome! Jerk tofu--awesome! Meat patties--awwww yeeaahhh! You have GOT to try this place! Stop reading this and go now! Do it!!"
1,"I went into this location and had a coupon for a buy one foot long sub get the second one for 99 cents well my total ended up being $15.76, sounds a  bit high, well my preparer Hector ""Clerk 21"" did not how to use the register and called another employee to ring in my coupon, which they did not apply obviously since my bill was almost $16.00 and they were cursing and were rude and were complaining about how they did not have time to mess around because they had a party platter order they had to prepare. Very disappointing, maybe Subway should invest in better training or maybe higher wages to get better staff."
5,"Whenever I get the chance to stop over in this great city I always try to swing by Monte's. The service is friendly but don't expect to be looked into every 2 minutes. Which personally I prefer. This has a very local feel and the prices are just right.

I had the Blue Plate special with egg whites. It was wonderful. Not greasy. The artichoke sandwhich is also off of the hook! Very good down home food all the way around and extremely reasonably priced. Especially coming from the West Coast.

The other added bonus is Monte's is located in the Willy Street area...the more eclectic part of ""downtown""."
1,"So, I know it's crazy that I'm giving this place one star but hear me out. I recently had my engagement pictures here. I was so so excited, bc I come here every year and I thought it was going to be an amazing experience. I have never been more wrong. I paid the $31 fee to have my pictures professionally done there, not a big deal bc I loved this place and it was worth that to me. I then found out we only had an hour to take them.  Ok still, we can hurry. As soon as we walked into the building, we were bombarded by the woman who runs the place(I assume), asking what we were doing, did we have a permit, and what not. We told her yes we paid, and we were waiting for our  photographer. She then asked me if I had any clothing changes planned, and I said yes, just one. Her answer astounded me. ""We don't allow people to change in our bathrooms, so you need to find someplace else, like your car"". Ummmm, it was a Saturday at 3pm and almost 80 degrees outside, how can you tell me I need to change in my car??  I was floored, speechless. She then goes ""it's in the contract"" bc she must have seen our jaws on the floor. How can you ask that of someone?!?  I work in customer service, and the way were treated that day was awful. Thank god a friend of mine who works with a limo service was there that day and I changed in the limo. My fiancé did not bc he did not feel comfortable. When we came in, she followed us and goes ""10 minutes left"". Um again, what?!  I would assume she's walked the grounds before, and it takes a while to get around, especially in heels.  We ended up going 10 minutes over.. Oops. And my photographer stayed to take pics with my ring. Apparently the woman tracked her down and said she needed to leave. I was so excited to take my engagement pics there, considering they will be the only ones I take, and this lady ruined it. I've never been treated so terribly. Especially in a public place like that. Part of me really never wants to go back there ever again. She needs a crash course on customer service. Bc she has zero. I would be fired and lose a lot of money if I treated people the way she does."
1,"I stayed at this pig trot about 3 years ago with my then girlfriend (now wife). I found the hotel to be disgusting, dirty, roach infested and in a dangerous crime-ridden neighborhood.  There wasn't even a shower curtain!  But I'm writing now to point out what an awful staff they have.

I had reserved the room for 2 people (me and my girlfriend). She flew in separately from me.  I got there first and was checking in.  The girl at the desk was an Eastern European. Trying to make small talk I asked her where she was originally from.  She hissed, ""I'm not going to tell you!"" I said, ""Sorry I was just making small talk, it's common in the US to do that.""  She said, ""It is a strange question and I will not answer it."" At this moment I noticed she actually had a tip jar on the counter.  Unreal.

So, anyway, she gave me a key and I said I needed two keys. She said, ""Why would your girlfriend not be with you?"" SO Of course I said, ""Sorry, but I'm not going to tell you!"" I smirked and took my 2 keys to the nasty room.

Later when I checked out I asked the owner (an Indian or Pakistani) where the lady who checked me in was from....he told me BOSNIA!  So whoop dee doo I found out!! Haha...She's BOSNIAN!

BOSNIA BOSNIA BOSNIA! Slobodan Milošević would be proud."
1,"As a new yelper, I feel the need to span the star spectrum, but I really had a hard time trying to think of a 1.  Then I remembered a little voyage I took last fall, coupon in hand, to Zoe's, which is right between my apartment and work.  The coupon gave me pretty much any menu item with a drink purchase.  Thank God I had that coupon, becuase I would have been pissed if I had actually payed $7.50 for a ""spinach quesadilla"" which was cream cheese and cooked spinach between two tortillas.  I could have made it better for $.45 at home.  
Then I actually went back again to give it a second chance (I had a lot of coupons) and ate a very boring sandwich with cafeteria stlye mashed potatoes.   Maybe this place would be better for non vegetarians....my coworker liked his Greek Chicken plate, (liked, not loved)....it may go up to 2 or 3 stars for carnivores."
5,Oh my god I wasn't sure about this place pull in up but I should have after deein its a hole in the wall Mexican food restraunt this place is AMAZING the food is Fenominal the salsa is tasty and spicy and the food is out of this world first time here and everything looks soo good I wasn't sure on what to order I will be back to have more mmmmmmmm mmmmmmm good When u come here no matter what u get u need to try the Guacamole hands down the best Guacamole ive ever had in my life & im not exagerating its extremely fresh & addictive
5,I stop in often to pick up things for craft projects. The people are always friendly and I can almost always find what I need. Often times for less than the big box craft stores. I grew up going to this store and love the location. Easy to stop in and pick up a few things. Love it here!
1,"Don't shop here.  The owner John Menard is PURE EVIL...  Menards is a terrible place to work, not a good corporate citizen, and a terrible customer for its' vendors.  Spend your money in a local hardware store."
1,"This place saddens me. It is a void. It has a sterile atmosphere. The sandwiches were dry and not very good. The prices were high. The only reason that I went was because they handed out coupons in my neighborhood. If I had to say something good about this place, it would be that it is clean."
5,"This place is really our favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix area by far. The corn fritter appetizer is so yummy and I love their pad thai, which I usually get vegetarian with tofu. I have not had any veggie pad thai that is better anywhere else!  Wish it were closer to us, we'd go a lot more often if it was."
1,I was disgusted this morning to drive by and see a Whole Foods being put in this center just down the way from Trader Joe's.  Shame on Town & Country for even allowing this and shame on Whole Foods for such an underhanded move.  Wrong.
5,"This is the only spot I trust to get my ride a bath, even though I drive a beater, the staff here treat it as if its an expensive European car. 

Attention to detail not only comes from the car wash staff but also from Gene who meticulously maintains the gloss and shine of all my Italian kicks."
1,"I went there for Mother's Day, and after reading many of the reviews here, it was exactly as I expected it to be. Coming here was not my idea. It is sub-par, old school (cough-cough) Italian out of the 60's. Most places would have given a Mimosa with brunch or even a rose to mom. Not here. There was a large display of some stuff they called food, but it was gross. Believe me, folks, this is not Italian but some semblance of what they called Italian. I am ashamed for them. 

As others suggested, the pasta was mush; there were breakfast buns on the dessert table, grizzled lamb, and butter knives for cutting meat, which could not cut through the ham! Someone mentioned the desserts were probably bought at Costo. I felt the same. This was all for the price of around $40 per person. Ugh! 

Did I mention the over-priced, watered down drinks? No real Italian would ever put cheddar cheese on an antipasto. Did I mention our food plates were piling up on our table, but no one came to take them away? Service was lacking for a place that didn't have to worry about serving food for the day. 

Every item at the buffet table should have had a serving utensil but many had none. I was very uncomfortable having to pick with my hands. It was all poor quality food and poorly prepared. Not for foodies and especially not for real Italians!"
5,"Loved this place. I've had menudo in Tucson, El Paso and home made by my ex-mother in law, Mexican from Juarez, and I liked this one better...

The chips were made to order, the salsa was really good and the place was clean, including the restrooms. Staff was friendly and good prices. Too bad I don't live in Phoenix."
1,"Place is dated. There are always multiple machines broken and when machines break, they are not repaired for quite a long period of time.  Maintenance is clearly not a priority. I inquired as to why maintenance was not a priority but received no response.   Do not join unless you get tour with manager  and discuss maintenance with manager and get comfortable the situation will change.  You do get access at other clubs around country, so I am able to go to other 24 hour fitness facilities and have found other facilities much more acceptable."
1,"So I have been wanting to come to this joint for EVA! How-EVA, our experience was not fabulous. It was more like DRAB-ulous. Things started out great when we snagged a cozy little table in the corner about 9pm on a Friday night. The liquor wall looked too tempting to pass up, so I ordered a Gibson with some Tito's vodka (my fav!)- well the cocktail onions were soggy and mushy upon first bite and it pretty much ruined the drink. The server did not offer to bring me something different, he just apologized and looked for the jar of onions and said they are all like that. Hmmmm. There were a MILLION specials. It took like 5 minutes literally to read the entire list. It was baffling. The prices are NOT cheap. We were already thinking we should give this place a shot during $5 plate happy hour. Anyway then we ordered some grilled oysters. Well, they came out with Chirozo on them- and I barely eat seafood, but definitely not pork! All the server said was ""Well it listed the chorizo on the menu""- Hmmmmmm. Again, we just kept them. Then my boyfriend tried one and it was full of sand! At this point, we had already ordered the mushroom toast points, but after the oyster debacle, we had pretty much decided to go elsewhere and especially when the next appetizer came, it just was overloaded with brie and canned looking mushrooms, totally overcooked and unappetizing. We politely told the server that we were just going to call it a night (there was NO WAY we were going to spend 35-40 bucks on the entree lottery)- he then offered to ""do anything"" to make our experience better and we thanked him and just explained why we were leaving and we would be back to try the happy hour another time (truth). Anyway then he took like 15 minutes at least trying to get the manager to take the oysters off (I would rather have paid for them) and then he FINALLY brought us our bill with the two drinks AND the uneaten mushroom appetizer. I am a foodie and have been in the business since I was 15 and I NEVER EVER want anything for free or removed from my check, however, there are certain circumstances- and I must say I can not remember having a completely horrible experience like this one on a long time- where I feel  that as a server, let alone a manager- I would comp the entire tab and offer to have the guest back on some sort of gift certificate or comp.  Again, I NEVER EVER look for anything free in a restaurant, but if you had been sitting in my shoes last night, you would agree this experience warranted some above and beyond customer service to retain guests in the future. Well that didn't happen, perhaps they have been around so long they just figure oh well who cares, we are well known so whatever. Well, whatever is I will NEVER attend that restaurant or any of their other concepts, plus now I have written a poor review, and all my FB friends know about it too. I'm sure in my life moving forward Rokerij will also come up in conversation with some of my foodie friends and they too will know I think this place is overrated. We left the waiter a very nice tip and thanked them by never attending their establishment again. Such a shame. Customer service is dead these days... SIgh....Hope it was worth the $30 bucks guys."
5,"Some of the best bar food in the state.  Burgers and Pizza are always a fantastic choice.  Entertainment is hit or miss, but at least they have some.  However, my favorite reason to go here is it serves the coldest tap beer ever!!!"
5,"This is not only a grocery store, it's a staple in the community. Tim and Kevin Metcalfe have kept the tradition alive! Yes, this store is pricier than others but you do indeed get what you pay for. The Metcalfes also give back more to the community that all the rest of the grocery retailers combined!  This is a good hearted family running an excellent local grocery store."
1,"Recently purchased a car here. Thought it would be decent, due to average reviews and featured on an app I downloaded for recommended dealers. By far not the best experience. They will tell you what you want to hear during the dealing process, and then make all sorts of excuses not to follow through with promises. 

Have had issues with the car, drivers window quit working, so they told us to let the guy who was replacing the windshield know. We did, the guy fixed it, we were on our way. 

Came time to make our first payment, which they told us wasn't due for another two weeks, and then a few days later was supposedly due and late, and informed us that we owe them now for the drivers side window. And since we were late, it ""threw up red flags"" for them. Really?! So not coming through on your cheap little 500 mile warranty didn't throw up ""red flags"" for us as consumers? Whatever.  

These people are very shady. Do not let the initial welcoming manner fool you. They are money sharks and will not help you whatsoever in good faith. Shop around and stay away from them. The only reason we didn't give the car back is the 1000 dollars we had already paid. We are just going to go to our regular mechanic now, and deal with them as less as possible.

To add fuel to the fire, the car blew a head gasket a month after we bought it. They want $2600 to fix it, and will not do anything in good faith. Waste of a lot of money $1700 to be exact (down payment, first month worth of payments and all the towing)... Words of advise...STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE. There are way better dealers in the valley that will help you. We now have to save up for another down payment for a different car. They can eat s**t."
1,"Leanna was the photographer at a wedding I was in.  Her assistant was nice, but Leanna came in with a bad attitude.  I felt she was extremely unprofessional.  All of my family noticed how rude she was.  I saw the proofs and they were ok, but I don't think it was worth putting up with her attitude."
5,"This place is making me a cookbook hoarder! Helpful Staff. Great deals on books that aren't even an a year old. All in good condition. Everything is categorize for easy finding. They even have music items, comics and magazines."
5,"I'll start with the disclaimer that I REALLY like the people that work at this place which is downstairs from my work.  The food is always great quality and if you need a last minute ""gift,"" they have wine and many other goodies to make a  basket (which I have done).
The happy hour serves local beers and their house wine is only $3.00 which makes it irresistible for a bargain shopper like me (and it's good too).
Stop by and say hello to Ally, Pierce, Gloria and Dave - and rest of the gang.  People are not strangers there for long!"
1,"Absolutely horrible. I ordered a white wine spritzer, the server told me I don't think we carry that, I don't know these fancy drink names. I told her what it was and that it's been around forever. My wife ordered a frozen strawberry lemonade and got a regular. When ordering our food she laughed when I specified no poblano peppers or any spice. I ordered a weight watchers meal as I wasn't too terribly starving. When our food came she just assumed that my wife who is larger than I wanted the weight watchers. I was completely appalled. I spoke to the manager at once told her everything and explained we were leaving and I was paying for nothing. Next time I visit Phoenix this will not be where I go."
1,Soooo expensive.  They come up with arbitrary charges that end up costing an arm and a leg.  They also ripped the seam on one of my shirts in the process of cleaning it.  Would NOT recommend.  There is a $2.25 dry cleaner right down the street on Indian School that I've started going to instead.
5,"My Dad and I went to get some latin food.  I have been before so I knew what to expect.  This place has really good authentic food at a really good price.  

I got the Posole which was excellent and a huge portion and I got a beef tamale.  I also had the cantaloupe drink and it was awesome.  

If you haven't been you gotta check this place out."
5,"These guys saved my bacon by literally giving me the fenders from their bike. Really.

For those of you that take the good time to read my mediocre reviews, you'll know that I recently bought a fat bike. And I love it. Really, really love it.

But, I don't particularly enjoy the amount of water and crud those huge tires sling around. After my last ride, it felt like I was carrying around an extra 10-lbs of salty water weight, primarily in my bike shorts. Memories of a dirty diaper came to mind... 

So, I set about looking for fenders. I visited several bike stores in the area, none had what I was looking for in stock. So, I went online and ordered a set from Amazon. Who, eventually e-mailed me a ""whoops, sorry, those aren't in stock after all"" message. Curses!

Then I remembered that Revolution was just around the corner from my house, so I quick raced over to see if they had a set of fenders. And they did! Win!!

But... they were installed on a bike that was on the show floor. Fail!!

I inquired if they had extra fenders in stock - nope. 

I inquired if they would be interested in selling the ones from the show floor bike - yep!

Win again!!

And, because the fenders had been ""used"" (for one ride), they gave me an unnecessary, but greatly appreciated discount. 

Talk about nice guys. Thank you!! 

Great selection of parts and accessories, as well as bikes of all shapes and sizes. I will be back. I promise!"
1,"AWFUL AWFUL cellular service in AZ. I mjust switched from T mobile to At &T and BOT was that a stupid move. They are most unhelpful - I have dealt with them in the store, Customer service via phone and chat online and no one will help.... lousy phones lousy service. I have no texts for hours. I mget messages after a 2 hour to 24 hour delay. Ridicu;ous. If it is was not for IPHONE thises people would not be in buisness"
5,Doug did a great job on my Tag. It took longer then expected but was not his fault. Fixed it and polished it like new. I highly recomend him.
1,"Ok, so the reason why i am giving this place such a low score is mainly because they take themselves for granted waaaay too much. I was looking for a diner for a long time and when i saw it from the road i thought: oh this should be fun!!. oh well, 45 dollars for 2 entrees is waaay too much. plus the food was not fantastic, the service was soo arogant and the overall feel was like the were all saing: come on, you know you love it.. which immediately turned my off...

hope you have a better experience

good luck"
1,The service is absolutely horrible. The staff is rude and acts put out by your mere presence!
1,"I'm rating this of my initial experience with this place and my disappointment. I had been wanting to check out this place as I had been hearing great things about the wine and cheese selections plus I drive by  there everyday. 

My friend and I chose to check it out on a mellow weekday afternoon and we did not even eat/drink here because of the initial impression we received. We walked into the front entry and saw there was only one couple at a table and it was slow due to the time of day. We looked around and eventually expected to see anyone who worked there as we awkwardly waited near the hostess stand for several minutes. Finally, a server emerged who did not even acknowledge us in any way and went to help the one table. After that it appeared that a cook or someone from back of house came out to the bar and again did not acknowledge us either. Finally, a couple minutes later the waiter came out into the dining room again and we asked to see a wine list just to get his attention. He then made his way over to hand us a wine list. At that point, we were pretty much over this place as we did not want to see how much worse the service might get if we actually stayed. I was really disappointed that the experience was so bad without even trying the place as I was really looking forward to finding a new downtown restaurant."
5,Love the old diner feel. This place was absolutely delicious! I had the welcome burger & fries & my bf had the big jim. Both perfection!! I can't wait until next time so I can get the biscuit ;)
1,"waited 20 min. for a booth, then 15 min after seated to get iced tea and water. Walked out after 20 more min and no sign of server or salads...."
1,My wife and ate there tonight. Food so so. Service not good. Efficent but not friendly. I had the feeling she wanted to be somewhere else
1,"Overpriced!

They don't clean your clothes any better than any other cleaners, but you pay for the convenience of the drive-up service.

Unless there's some reason that you can't get out of your car, I'd advise driving past this place and taking the time to walk in somewhere else."
5,"Some friends of mine took me to the Wild Thaiger for my birthday.  I can't think of a better place to have my birthday dinner. This place is fantastic!  The food was great and served with true elegance but in a casual setting. Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed, the service was great.  We were told right from the start that there would be at least a 20 minute wait and they were dead on in their estimate.  No problem at all.  I don't mind waiting if I'm told the wait time and it is accurate. 

The atmosphere is relaxing, intimate and the decor is not over done as are so many Thai restaurants.  Can you say clean?  Even on such a busy night they kept the place almost spotless, even the bathrooms.  The kitchen is open to the dinning area and you can see how well managed and organized every thing is.  The kitchen staff looked like a well oiled machine in action.

The Food and Drinks:
Well to start off, we didn't order any adult beverages this evening as we were going out to a local night club after dinner for our fill of libations. Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection!  I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.

Appetizers:
We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.

Dragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.

Satay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!

Wild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.

Veggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.

Hot Pot:
We also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.

Main Course:
I had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!

Once again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.

Desert:
OMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!  Enough said. Period!

Will I go back?
I wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal there.

Hats off to The Wild Thaiger.
The best Thai food I have found anywhere in Arizona."
1,"My husband & I recently went there for a Port tasting ,,,to say it was a disappointment is an understatement.  We have been there several times & live only a few miles away. With that said - the Port tasting was a DISASTER! GO NOT GO THERE FOR TASTINGS!! Unlike most tastings they mark up the bottles by 100% in order to make $$ & sell their very mediocre food.  The pours were so uneven they ran out of Port for several people!! We had all paid $20 & the pours were uneven - BS!!!!!  I was livid & then they served us a tomato/basil/.crap flatbread ""complimentary"" - WTH?? with Port?? Obviously these people know NOTHING about wine pairings.  My husband & I were very disappointed in the service, food, price point of bottles (laughable really) & the overall experience!  DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Keep trying to unsubscribe from their mailing list, though today they sent me 7 SPAM emails.  

Stop it! 

They also have a link to review their spa's on Yelp on the e-mail - though it just goes to the Yelp homepage. 

They obviously don't care much about their customers.  

It was so long ago I was there I can't remember the service."
5,"Firstly, hat's off to Jenn H. who had the cojones to give this place a lousy review without also coming off as insensitive.

The story of the various Native American tribes is an incredibly solemn one that is all too often glazed over in your average grade school American History course.  I was blissfully unaware of it until my wife decided to dedicate the rest of her life to studying indigenous cultures and schooled me on the following - For 200 years, Native Americans were seen as uncivilized beasts in need of strict re-education to meet the white man's version of civility.  Not until the 1960's (and as recently as 1990 with the passage of several federal laws including the Native American Languages Act) has the United States finally reversed course and decided to protect the various Native American cultures.  Sad, but true, and something your average American probably doesn't know and likely doesn't want to know or care to know.

Thankfully there are places like the Heard Museum which does a brilliant job of telling the story of many of the tribes that were located in the Southwest.  I feel it is unduly categorized as an ""Art Museum"" by many instead of an ""American History"" museum.  Yes, you get the art - in the form of pottery and jewelry and Kachina - but you also get the traditional clothing, the traditional cooking, the language component, and most importantly the history lesson.  If you leave here thinking, ""that was just a bunch of pottery and dolls"" then you've totally missed the point.

The first floor of the museum has a great flow to it with each section dedicated to a different tribe.  Obviously there are many similarities, but the most interesting things are the subtle differences between the tribes.  It also has changing exhibits on the second floor - when I was there it featured a wonderful exhibit on modern Native American art (sculpture and paintings and jewelry).  There is also a heart-wrenching exhibit on the horrific boarding schools the children were forced to attend, often far from their homes and at extremely young ages, to strip them of their cultural heritage.  My favorite part has to be the hands-on exhibit, likely meant for children but I couldn't keep away from it.  So what if I'm pushing over a 5 year old to get a pipe cleaner and tissue paper to make a flower?  There is even a section of the museum dedicated to other non-American indigenous art and garb.

What an excellent excellent museum.  You leave much more informed and with a necessary touch of white guilt."
1,"i recently moved into cityscape, a high rise apt. bldg. just a block or two away from this establishment and i've started trying out the local eateries as i don't like to cook much. i ordered a tavern burger and cottage cheese. when asked how i wanted the burger i said well done, meaning no pink, but specifically stated i didn't want the burger to be burned and/or dry. the bartender assured me that would not happen. well, guess what? the burger was way overdone and left a bad aftertaste that lingered for quite a while. i should have requested the burger be tossed and another mad however i just wasn't in the mood for a hassle. plus the bartender never did ask how my food was. it's a shame as i left very unsatisfied and with a burnt taste in my mouth, unlikely to every return or to recommend this place to others. i'm sure it was not intentional but the result was still the same."
5,"I almost didn't go there for dinner because of these bad views and that would have been a big mistake!
The food was extraordinary (we had enchiladas, shrimp fajitas and my friend had the tamales).
we ordered a pitcher of margarita and it was VERY strong on the tequila.
I'll definitely go back!"
5,"Don't be fooled because it's in a truck stop, truckers know where there are good places to eat. Stop here just for the desserts, I bought an eclair that must have weighed a pound, delicious, like they are supposed to be made. Cream Puffs look like they wouldn't fit in a one pound coffee can... grin. Don't miss this place..."
1,"This store has set hideous customer service standards! I was lied to about their return policy by an employee and screwed over! They gave me the run around when I asked to speak to a manager...she was conveniently never present and was the ""only one who could help me."" When giving me the final verdict on my issue, she cowardly had her employees do it for her on the phone (of course not face to face) and could not even call me herself. I highly recommend taking your business to a different pet boutique where quality service matters!"
5,"Fantastic hole in the wall (hole in the trailer?) restaurant. Great relaxed vibe, with good old bluesy southern music as a backdrop to the even better tunes of familiar conversation. I loved how hometown it felt. This is definitely a place where strangers become friends.

Fantastic service! Our server was Brandon, who was so helpful in making sure my meal was vegan and describing every delicious detail to us. Upon leaving, every employee waved and thanked us for dining. So nice!

On to the food...fantastic. I had a veggie burger with fried avocado on the side. Life changing. My boyfriend had the classic burger and fries, and loved it. I can't wait to come back and try the vegan po'boy.

I'm really excited to be a frequent patron of the Welcome Diner. So happy we found it!"
1,"Worst experience ever!  I am a fan of Richardson's so I thought we should check this place out.  Stopped in on a Friday night around 8pm without reservations just to see how long the wait would be.  Great host at the door greeted us and was really friendly.  He said there was over an hour wait upstairs but we could try our chances downstairs where it was all open seating.  We headed downstairs, grabbed a couple glasses of wine and waited for seats to open up.  We waited quite a long time for a table and multiple groups were able to grab seats before us, so we saw a couple ladies paying their  tab and asked if we could get their seats when they were ready to leave.  We ended up talking to them for a while before they left.  When we went to sit down, a very unfriendly brunette bartender said this other couple had been waiting longer and were next on ""the list"".  The other couple was already sitting!  She gave them our seats  at the bar and someone else who had just walked in grabbed their chairs.  I'll never be back.  If there's a list, tell the door guy and offer people to put their names on it when they arrive.  And if that couple needed to sit at the bar so bad, I would have been fine with the table.  Customer service is obviously lost on this place (except the sweet door host.  Worst experience I've had in a long time.  Contrary to my efforts to calmly explain to the bartender, she did nothing to resolve the issue."
5,"I have been seen by the Nurse Practitioner Christa and Dr. Laura Kimbro so far. Both experieces have been good. They are really good about following up with you. They can do ultrasounds right in the office if your insurance covers it.  They do all their baby deliveries at Banner Desert.

One small complaint...they take the whole thanksgiving weekend off. Although there is someone always on call, it would be nice if they were open that friday."
1,"My wife went to Cali nails to get manicure and pedicure with gel, they are extremely rude and way overcharge! Then the finished product was crappy. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Nails were crooked told me my fingers were crooked bubbled gel polish whole nail not even polished"
1,I have stayed here before without any issues. This last stay of 6 nights was a different story. The first night we had loud and rude neighbors. The sixth night and seventh day our room smelled like pot. The cleaning people did a crappy job and the hallway looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in quite a while. I will not be staying here again.
1,DO NOT STAY HERE. They charged my credit card for services not rendered I had to contest the charges with my credit card company.
5,"The most chill, relaxing, artistic coffee shop in Madison. Love the outdoor seating watching the bikers go by sipping on an iced tea. Their drinks are great. Service is nice, very polite staff. I also love that it's next to Absolutely Art."
1,The night shift manager(female) was unprofessional. I couldn't tell if the dancers were beautiful because the club is TOO dark. The dancers look bored while dancing and one of them almost fell out of the main stage. The side stages don't have pole-dance. Club features mostly dull blondes with fake breasts. No natural beauty.
5,Great Place. Just good quality breakfast and lunch foods.
1,"The reason I Yelp is for entertainment and because I use the reviews from others to choose where I spend my money, so I like doing my part by sharing my own experiences. My intention is not to get free stuff. Ever. I rarely write negative reviews, and the reason I wrote a negative review for Zoe's was because I believe the conditions of the restaurant were a health risk. That being said, here is my update. So one of the managers from Zoe's asks for my phone number so he can find out more information. I give it to him, willing to share my experience. He calls me, hears me out, and apologizes. Then he asks for my address so he can send me a gift certificate. Unnecessary, I tell him, but nice touch. So I give him my address. Now, 2 weeks later, nothing. I messaged the customer service person who had contacted me initially just to let her know the gift card had not arrived. Just pretty surprising the level of poor management. I am no longer wondering what happen to Zoe's because it is pretty self evident."
1,"Ew,  I recently moved to this area and this is now my local Dairy Queen.  Who knew you could mess up a Blizzard so bad?

First of all, the line was out the door.  We assumed that it was just a busy night.  Turns out they were out of multiple items (and did not put a sign up). People were upset and walking out.  Then the family in front of us ordered, but did not pay.  No card, no money left their hand.  What?  So like you are giving out free ice cream and making us wait in line?  

I get up to the counter and ask a question about the ingredients of a Brownie Batter blizzard.  They are like, it is just brownies.  My response: Anything else?  They had to go ask someone.  What?  Seriously?!  So I finally get my answer and order it.  My husband also ordered a blizzard.  He ordered a Turtle Pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard.  We never got a receipt.  When I asked for one, they said they did not have any.  What?!

We pay and wait.  And wait.  Oh, but while we wait, we get to watch the kitchen person.  He was making a chicken sandwich.  With his LONG ponytail hanging over the grill.  Yum?  More like gross.  Then both my husband and I notice that he grabbed a raw chicken breast (while not wearing a glove) and placed it on the bare counter.  He then wiped his hand on his pants.  What?  Salmonella much?  Any food standards?

We get our medium blizzards.  The ice cream normally extends to the top or slightly over the top of the cup.  This time the ice cream barely made it to the top of my cup. My husband had ice cream under the cup.  When we asked if this was a medium, they said yes.  And just walked away.  

I walked out feeling very unsatisfied and my husband I determined this will be our last visit to the local DQ.  Besides the poor service, the food standards were disgusting."
1,"If you are an audiophile, then stay away   FAR AWAY.!!!   I brought in a Luxman hybrid amp because of some parasitic noise that I thought was due to a dirty volume pot.  After they replaced 5 capacitors for about 175.00, ( WHY??)  I took it home and guess what , it made NO difference whatsoever.  So I brought it back.. Here is where the problems really began  Martin, ( you are a total DICK) was so rude I thought I was getting punked.    I hope to all that is holy you go out of business soon.    My amp is still not fixed.  I am out 175.00.  And I do not want to go back there to face this very very rude individual.  He was even rude to my wife, who by the way is the sweetest person I know. (I have to say that).  I am sorry our paths crossed at all!!   By the way, even if you are not an audiophile, but simply a decent human being I still advise you stay away...far away."
1,"Bad service. They were slow to give my order even though they were only a few customers that time. Also I spotted a few homeless guys just outside sitting. Not only that, the place isn't all that neat. Find a spots of dirt on the floor. If it weren't a request of my niece then I wouldn't have gone here."
1,Never going to any Hooters again. 1) Flat Ass everywhere. Eat some of the wings and do some squats. 2) They increased the price of the endless wings for the new year yet the wings got smaller. The manager said that it is because they are being charged more. They might want to think about changing suppliers then. 3) To charge for every ranch dressing is asinine. We asked for one ranch each and she brought us a ranch every time we got our next plate of six tiny wings. Never did our server Ashlea tell us we were going to have to pay for each ranch that we did not even ask for. At least the beer was good and at a decent price. I think we will stick to Zipps!
5,"Surprisingly large selection of books here.

My wife knew about this metaphysical book store for years, but when we went to visit it, its original location had been all boarded up for some time.  We were later tipped off as to where it had relocated.  The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but you go in and you are greeted by a wall of books going down a long wall.  I was impressed.  While I don't buy these kinds of books like I used to, some of the old used Manly P. Hall books (some of them signed) on the back wall were very tempting.

This just might be the best, most varied used book store I've found in the Valley so far.  If you're looking in the Valley for spiritual/metaphysical/religious sorts of books in the Phoenix area (and there's a few of them there), don't skip this place.  Lots of books, lots of space, and friendly service.  It's cooler in there than outside, and I'm not just talking about the temperature."
1,We tried to make a reservation for a party of seven and were told by Alecia that they could not accommodate us. She did not attempt to make alternate arrangements and was condescending in the process. We were extremely disappointed and will be taking our business elsewhere.
1,First time ordering from Pizza Heaven. I picked this place because of the yelp reviews. Perhaps their regular crust pizza is great but this was by far the worst gluten-free pizza I've ever had(no exaggeration). The crust was tasteless and soggy like wet cardboard. I popped it into the oven to see if I could get e crust crispy but no luck. I'm so disappointed.
5,"This little store is located within the Arizona Center here downtown.  I have shopped here before, as it is in the area that I work at.  It is locally owned by a couple, and they actually have two locations...this one and another location in Gainey Ranch in Scottsdale.

This place carries mostly touristy stuff.  I think thier prices are a little high, but the store is well kept, the people that work here are wonderfully nice and kind, and you can get a garden variety of items to choose from."
1,"This place is tired on every level. Staff is polite and friendly but thoroughly inefficient and clueless. There's a cute hotel around the corner, called Clarendon, just go there and enjoy life ;)
Back to the 'Hilton Garden Inn': interiors are dated to say it polite, the 'bar tender' is more interested in watching some football games on the TV screen, the breakfast room staff on weekends just sits there doing nothing even when you're the only customer (note: the staff during the week is different, they're good). Check in is delayed way beyond 3PM, I've ordered a taxi to the airport on my check-out day: they did order one but managed not to tell me that it's actually here for 20 minutes!!!! And so on. Never again - NOT recommended. Ah, and well, they don't reply to emails either."
1,The worts place for service on your car they stole my wallet even though was hidden in the glove compartment. They hired criminals and illegals    to work for them I will suggest to never go to there isn't safe
1,"A walgreens with no liquor? What am I, in Utah?"
1,"I agree with Pauly C. I disagree with his review being GTL. I am also from Texas, the meat beneath the breading in the chicken fried steak was absolutely atrocious, the gravy was decent but not the best I have had. The bread was deplorable, I've had better day old bread from fry's. The bbq sauce tasted worse than krafts original, and this is supposed to be a homeage to Texas BBQ and food. I would never go there again even if I was starving and paid to eat there. For real bbq visit Bobby Qs on 27th ave and northern, I have yet to find a decent chicken fried steak in Phoenix."
5,"This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town!  This is not your roach infested 24 hour drive through kind of burrito joint either.  Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca #1 and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix!
1-Full bakery with mouth watering fresh pastries
2-Fresh ingredients and great prices
3-Also serves beer if you feel like having a Corona with your meal as opposed to take out
4-Little market has the best prices in town on citrus fruits and just enough of everything to cook up a little Mexican meal (Ranch Market not needed!)
5-Make your own pico/ salsa bar, make it your style and get as much of it as you want:)
So, if you are downtown looking for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Of course it is super casual take out or seat yourself kind of place so don't  try to flatter your date here! But get there early, I'm pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10..."
1,"The bar:  Very disappointed.   Music too loud. Too ethnic. Poor set up with entrance outside the restaurant.   I used to ""happy hour"" every weekend in years past ... What a change, will never go in the bar again...no class whatsoever.     What happened?"
1,My radio and navigation system went out on my Acura.   I took it in to Zimbrick who immediately determined that a small fuse had blown.  I was glad it was only a fuse until I pick up the car and was charged $100 for replacing a two dollar fuse.  I complained but got nowhere.  They have since lost several thousand dollars of my service business to other repair shops.
1,"Really nice ambience, super nice. So nice that we wanted to stay and have a drink and something to nibble on in the downstairs bar. Unfortunately the server wasn't anywhere as nice as the ambience, she essentially kicked us out because we sat at table that was reserved (although there was no reserved sign) and didn't offer to help us find a seat in a full bar. So much for hospitality. They probably do have great offerings here in the food and drink category, but lots of other (nicer) places do too. So that's where we ended up going."
1,"TASC is government run tax payer funded legal extortion.  I live in Cali had a bong confiscated in AZ, no arrest, no ticket and now I have to jump through hoops to avoid a class 6 felony on my record.  FUCK AZ AND FUCK TASC"
1,"if I could give this place -10 i would...

here is the deal... we live not far from here, so me first, went a few years ago, so this isn't want this is about.

husband went about a year ago.  he injured himself.  gave him an Rx for advil and was sent on his way.  (Turns out, he actually had a torn muscle, and needed extensive PT and was in so much pain, etc...)

This morning is when it all comes to a head...  my daughter had this ""pimple' on her chin that felt like someone punched her in the jaw she said.  So i looked at it, thought it might be an ingrown hair so i did 'surgery' on it... for lack of a better phrase.  used tweezers, a sanitized stick pin and got the 'ingrown hair"" out (although did not find a hair)...  

So my daughter wakes up this morning, her whole chin is swollen.  She is a Navy Veteran, served in war and everything.  She is NOT a complainer.   The doc came in and didn't even look at her for more than 2 minutes.  It was a female doc and didn't introduce herself.  Did not put gloves on and examine it, just basically looked at her, and gave her an Rx for antibiotics told her to not squeeze it and said that if it wasn't better in a couple of days to go to the E.R..  Say whaa??  

as the day goes on, my daughters face becomes more and more swollen.  More and more red, just doesn't look right....   i said, ""honey, I need to look at that""  i barely put any pressure on that, and a bunch of green puss (yes tmi) comes out.  it did not take much pressure for me to get a bunch of infection out.   i contacted a friend who is a PAC...  She said I did the right thing and that daughter needs to see a doc soon and keep taking the antibitoics.  So that is what we are doing, she is making an appointment at the VA and will continue to take the antibiotics as prescribed.

This actually looks like some sort of bite!  i am outraged at this place for not inspecting this further!  This young woman is NOT a complainer, and deserved an exam.  i mean I just barely touched it and stuff came oozing out!  wtf is that?  shouldn't the DOCTOR have done that?  

so after my experience, my husbands experience, and no my daughters experience...  we will drive further to get quality care!  

STAY AWAY FROM HERE!  Scottsdale Osborn is not too much further, and there is another urgent care up the street about 52nd st and Thomas Rd.  please, do not waste your time and money."
5,"I completely agree with Chris S. Happy pills. Seriously. EVERYONE at this hospital is SO NICE!!! The nurses, the doctors, all of the staff....day and night. My friend is being treated here and has been addmited for various days now, and everyone agrees this hospital has really made this whole situation so much more bearable and less stressful, considering. 

When you or a friend is going through illness or trauma, the last thing you want to deal with is rude and uncaring nurses and doctors. You will NOT experience that here....they are WONDERFUL.

The hospital itself is very nice, it feels modern and clean. There is even a nice ""healing garden"" you or patients can relax and get a little fresh air in. The food isn't that bad considering this is a hospital...I had a nice salad and sweet potato fries one day! Prices are like an airport.....expensive. But at least it's not typical cafeteria food.

Thank you Good Sam for taking such good care of my friend!"
5,"I'll start by saying I sat at the bar with a bunch of buddies for a game rather than actually sitting in the dining room so the comments about poor service may be legit. 

However, if you're looking to judge just the burgers and steaks they were great. Solid atmosphere with three big screens around a bar, the place is admittedly for an older crowd but they were very accomadating when six 24 year olds strolled in for a game."
5,Have been going to MCV Salon for more than a year. Always excellent service. Corina is friendly and energetic.  I always get a fantastic haircut.  Very well put together shop.
1,"1. They moved, and their website still shows the old address.  The new location is ""hidden"" behind a larger building, and to get into the salon, you have to enter in through an ""outer"" building; it's a suite inside of a building. Didn't matter much since they were closed by the time I found the place.

2. They were closed by 4:50pm, and they don't have their hours posted anywhere at their new location. I'd refer to their website for info, but it's apparently out of date.

I love Aveda products; I will apparently have to go elsewhere to buy them."
5,I came in yesterday with a pretty big group of ten plus we sat on the patio which was very nice. The waitress was very polite and was checking on us pretty consistently :).  This was the first time I had been there since it was redone and I really liked how it looked.  My friend and I tried the Chipotle Chicken and Wild Rice soup it was so delicious even on that very hot day so kudos to that!  I also tried one of the fried pickles with the sauce it came with it was also very good! Had a good time here.
1,"It's loud, the employees are not friendly, and you simply can't trust them for a wake up call... I didn't even get an ""I'm Sorry"" when they entered a 6am wake up call for 7am!

And I've been Marriott Platinum for 10 years! If they can't be courteous to their elite guests, how are they to everyone else? Skip this hotel..."
5,"Best barbershop in the phoenix area.  Go to Vadim...he is like the michael jordan of cutting hair! 16 bucks and some change with a military discount. Straight razor lineup, hot shaving cream, hot towel, and a slightly awkward neck massage.  There are several tvs in there with man stations on...ie espn, as well as a clean decor with a fricken pool table! Go there...like, now!"
1,"Always loved this place, but last time we tried it had a terrible experience.  Wanted to order fish and was told they no longer served it.  About 5 minutes later the same waitress brings out a huge fish plate for the lady next to us.  We are like "" What the HECK"" ????  Needless to say if we are not good enough to eat what anyone else gets, then we are taking our business else where.  The food that we got was not that great this time anyway."
5,"What can I say. I love this place! Great coffee, great atmosphere, great staff, the other customers are even great! I do wish they would get gluten-free yummies but other than that the non gf baked goods look and smell insanely delicious. They have really good deals running throughout the week too."
1,"My experience was nearly the exact same as the one Dana M described.  Absolutely terrible!  Except she went so far as to say that she had hoped people who used them would bring someone with them.  I was by myself....... and in restrospect, glad for it!  Wouldn't want to subject anyone to such unpleasantness.  OH, and dont' order the berry smoothie.  Mine went down the garbage disposal as it was undrinkable."
5,Great service..great food...very fast!
5,"This place is awesome!
The prices are Great and the food is soooooo good!
The service is the best ive ever had at any restaurant in the valley, hands down.
They have security in the parking lot and that shows the owner cares about her customers :) 
I go as often as I can and you should too"
5,"My girlfriend called this place (found them through Yelp) after another salon butchered her bangs and cut them too short.  They let her drop in with no appointment, fixed her bangs, and made her very happy. 

They are really nice people, too.  She will definitely be going back there for any future hair appointments.  Actually, I probably will too."
1,"Ah, Red Letter. I heard they got rid of their jerk off booth. Which maybe helps their case of being less skeevy. I'm not really against jerk off booths, but I have heard some crazy stories about this particular one. It didn't seem well monitored. I really hate the selection here and the prices are higher than other's. They seemed to have more fetish stuff than Selective though. So I guess there's that. Overall I'd suggest staying away, Red Letter has a bad rep for a reason."
5,"Ken's is great. We rarely have ever got bad meat here - and we've been to Ken's at least once a week for almost 15 years. 

Virtually all the steaks are great. People really like the Burgundy Pepper Steaks. The Rib Eyes and NY Strips are my favorites. 

The Sheboygan brats are fabulous. The ribs are great too - nice and meaty. When my family does burgers we always get their sirloin burgers. Really tasty.

The staff is often younger people - but they are very nice and well trained. 

The only downside would be is that it's pretty expensive - especially the non-meat products. I only get the non-meat things if I really need something and want to save a trip to the regular grocery store (but this is typical of mini-mart type places).

Beware - on nice days they will go through some things early. Don't wait until the last minute. 

They do let you call and make orders, which is nice if you want to guarantee something will be in.

A wonderful place. Highly recommend."
5,This place is the best. My nail guy even gave me his cell phone number so I can text him when I'm coming in to make sure they have a spot for me. My acrylics are gorgeous and Jimmy always takes great care of me. I won't go anywhere else.
5,"Fantastic museum. The Indian exhibits are expansive and usually heart wrenching. It is worth going on one of the free guided tours (they run frequently). My guide was very knowledgeable and provided much insight to all exhibits, including the temporary Georgia O'Keefe. The main entrance area is a nice place to lounge outside and have a picnic or something. The staff is very nice and friendly. Parking was easy."
5,"Not only is Mi Amigo's located inside the same esplanade/plaza as my all-time favourite AMC theatres, but Mi Amigo's makes fast food seem like it takes forever.

We got here right at noon. There was apparently a conference going on in Phoenix the same day because there were people everywhere wearing badges from different universities from all over the world. This place was PACKED. I could tell that the staff was not expecting this rush because they only had 3 servers and 1 bus boy and every table and chair in the house was taken.

We were told we would have to wait 5 minutes for a table, but 30 seconds later we were walked right in. As I mentioned, the place was PACKED and every single one of the servers had a glow about them from running around like crazy. They were HUSTLIN' and they did an impeccable job. 

Because there were only about 3 servers on staff this day, each server was responsible for one third of the restaurant (and it is HUGE). Each of them was helping the other out; I saw them running one another's food, and clearing plates regardless of whose section it was.

Our food arrived moments after we ordered it, and despite the fact that the restaurant was slammed, everyone was very pleasant. They made sure to smile in between their sprints to and from the kitchen.

It was a wonderful experience dining at Mi Amigo's and we actually ended up going twice over the weekend because we enjoyed it so much.

This place deserves mad props. It's quick, it's cheap (we paid $15 for 3 people's lunch) and it most definitely hits the spot."
1,"Carpet is torn up, locker rooms are in a sever need of a remodel from 1986. Equipment is old and there are always 5-7 machines broke. Seriously, this should be the crown jewel for Phoenix area 24 hour fitness gyms. Especially for the area. What a let down."
1,"Absolutely terrible experience.  Two thumbs down.

I have only heard good things about how great this place is. HA!

Our office ordered about 20 sandwiches from them.  The hot sandwiches were luke warm.  The chip order was not delivered. The drink order apparently was forgotten as well.  An $8 Ceasar salad that you would think would fill the container was so small it would fit in a small bowl.

Not recommended.  We will never order from there again and we have 350 people in our office."
5,"Had to update my review to share that I had dinner here last weekend for the final day of Arizona Cocktail Week. Of course, I couldn't pass up half priced hurricanes!

I tried the Vegan Po'boy (fried avocado, kale, pico de gallo and chipotle remoulade on french bread) and it was magical...but left me wondering how the heck do you fry avocados? No, seriously??? I'm sure google will tell me later which will lead to fun experiments in the kitchen.... 

Customer service is top notch--everyone that works here is super friendly and the wait time for food wasn't too shabby. I really love the vibe of this place and predict many visits in the future. Day or night, this place is one of the top restaurants in Phoenix."
5,"Old Navy!  The place to go for affordable clothing in Madison that doesn't cream Cheap-o like a lot of the ""Wet Seal"" type stores do.  Always fantastic sales and the clothes are uber-flattering.  I just picked up a knee-length tweed coat for about $50 and I get compliments every time I wear it.  The staff seem to enjoy their jobs as well.  5 stars!"
1,"Wow. 
This place sucks.
Honestly, don't waste your time. The food is overpriced. The service is awful. I hate the parking structure. It's just a mess. 
A hot mess.
How are they staying open?
My arnold palmer was $2.50. The tea was flavored and tasted really gross with lemonade.
We split the house salad which was obviously the prepackaged spring mix from Costco (or Sysco -- whatevs) 
Then we split a medium pesto, tomato, and basil pizza. The tomatoes were not ripe, the sauce was bland, and the pesto was non existent. And then the 30 pine nuts that were smashed into the cheese were overkill.
The crust was fair.
The server took my plate before I was finished and then set it back down after she realized my fork was in my mouth.
So for two teas, a house salad, and a medium pizza our tab was $22 
??? Costco Pizza would have been better.
Bleh."
1,"Very disappointing.  I was looking forward to a lox breakfast, but I don't eat farmed salmon.  So of course I had to ask if the lox was from farmed or wild salmon.  The server checked with the kitchen and it is farmed!  No lox for me.  I then asked about the chicken livers; ""are they organic?""  I thought the waitress was going to burst out laughing but she quickly composed herself and just lightly shook her head.  Okay, I'm a fuss bucket, I just can't eat nitrates, hormones, preservatives, etc.  I ordered a bagel and wished I had just gone to TJ and picked up some wild Alaskan lox, organic eggs, organic bread, organic butter and I would have gotten it all for the price of their lox & eggs breakfast plate with plenty of quality food stuffs for 4 other meals.  I think this place is past it's due date, old school, no growth and just getting by on low grade food stock and laughing all the way to the bank."
1,"I hate coming here, the receptionist seems mad always, she has a rude tone and makes you feel like you are annoying her.  I only cone here cus I'm leaving in a couple months but lawd this place needs a new crew not to mention dr. Kramer can be a rude one! I can tell he got irritated when he knew I had to be refered out..... read riviews in the end we make him business and his staff gets paid because we the patients bring business.... hmmm maybe they should think about this"
1,"Review 2/5/12
We were searching for a place to end the night with dessert.  We found Au Petit Four on Yelp and their were .4 miles from where we were.  COOL!  And we had their desserts before at the Esplanda location, so we know the the stuff is good.  Parking was almost impossible.  It is hard to find a space but we have a promise of good desserts so we grab the kids and walked.  

They have only been in the new location for 6 weeks.  It was pretty nice.  So we all walked to the dessert case.  Everything looked good.  We settled on:

1 Coffee, 3 Bottled waters, 1 Lemonade, 1 mango cake, 2 creme brulees, 1 white chocolate cake, and 1 large chocolate chip cookie.  There wasn't a pricing for any of the things we ordered, so when he came to tell us our bill was $48.50.  We were shocked.  WHAT?  No detailed bill?  The kids were tired and we just wanted to leave.  

10 items for $48.50 = Average $4.85 per item since we don't know the prices (non alcohol drinks and dessert)!  REALLY?????  I feel a little ripped off."
5,Wild Thaiger celebrated its 10th year anniversary this weekend!  This is a neighborhood restaurarnt with first class food.  The chef and owner consistently refreshes the menu to great delight!  You will not be disappointed.
1,"Was there for dinner there tonight 6/5/14. I was staying just a few blocks away and needed quick dinner so went to Cooperstown.  Had burgers there in the past and was very happy.  The Following is a quote from their menu, word for word:

""""Rusty Wallace"" St Louis Ribs.  St. Louis cut pork ribs smothered in dry rub and slow smoked to perfection, then lightly sauced with Cattlemen's BBQ sauce, and flashed on the flame broiler.""

I was hungry and came in about 20 minutes before close and was waited on by Matt.  I ordered ice tea and asked Matt if the ribs had been cooked recent or a long time ago and reheated.  And told him that if it was the latter that I wouldn't be having them.  He said he would ask the chef, came back and proceeded to say ""the bartender had them and said they were good"".  Hmmmm, that wasn't what I asked, but noted his answer in my mind and proceeded to order......Yes the ribs with two sides.

The food comes and it was exactly what I was afraid of, Ribs that had been boiled, then cooked in a oven and braised in marginal bbq sauce.  I ate them and it filled my stomach.  When he came by with the check, he asked ""so how were the ribs"".  I made him go get a menu and read the above quote. And then nicely without being a jerk told him that the establishment was falsely advertising the ribs.  I explained that I have smoked all meats in a wood fired barrel smoker for over 20 years and I would welcome the opportunity to go in the back and see where the ribs were slow smoked, if what I was saying was wrong.  I also explained that I had been out of tea for 10 minutes and I was a big boy and could handle the truth of how old the ribs were.  He then said that he didn't know how old they were.  Then without apologizing, asked how I was going to pay?  Really?????

The check was $20.45, and Matt got NO tip.  I had breakfast yesterday at a very popular, very busy establishment...No Relation....Matts BB, Great service and added a $5 tip to a $13 bill...no I'm not a cheapskate.

I would welcome a management response to the ribs and the service!!!!!!

1,"Based on the reviews went here for Lunch, they had Buffet with one Meat and 3-4 vegetarian dishes for around $10. 
Tried palak paneer but the paneer(cheese) itself  was missing the dish, it was like having chicken curry without chicken. Long story short the food lacked the taste that you find in good Indian cuisine..."
1,Shortly after posting this review someone from Pep Boys requested I email them about the situation at hand. Would you guess I received NO response?! What a crock. Save yourself and do not bring your car to a Pep Boys Service Center!
1,"You have got to be kidding me...absolutely unable to eat any of the four dishes ordered for lunch today. I read the below reviews and wondered if I was in the same place...mumbles the waiter couldn't have been less help if he had stayed home today.
The broth was flavorless, the noodles like a pile of jelly. The fried pork was so over cooked I couldn't chew it. The cold noodles were indeed cold, as they tasted like they were cooked 3 days ago and stored in the fridge. And the miso soup? Me so wished it was good, as I was starving when I left."
1,"BEWARE...if you want a reservation for less than four people, you are out of luck! Apparently there is one table in the dungeon that is reserved for parties less than four but it was reserved for he night. However, we were invited to sit in the bar...yipeee!!! I think it's good for them that they are busy, but I think they should seriously evaluate how they treat new customers. This place was highly recommended, but impossibly unaccessible."
5,"We knew we wanted to do some sight seeing downtown Phoenix and this location would allow us to do just that.  The quality of our stay with Holiday Inn Express has always been excellent, so when we decided to go to a Diamond Back baseball game, we discovered this location within walking distance.

The rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable.  We had a nice walk to and from the game, and again the next morning to attend Sunday services.  Would recommend this location for anyone needing to do business or pleasure near downtown Phoenix."
1,"I am giving up on AT&T/Singular.  As long as I stayed with the cheapest cell phone I think known to man, they worked fine for me?  Three phones and a few years later I am giving up.  l am a caregiver for a lady who is older.  I can't tell you how many times she and other people have told me they can't get through to me when I haven't left the city limits.  If I am going to have a stupid cell phone-I could live with out it, I'd like to get at least 60% of my calls.  Verizion is always rated the highest in virtually every study I read.  It is also the most expensive which I can deal with if I can get my calls.  I can keep my same number and get better service-I Hope, I hope, I hope."
1,"I took my two children here after going to the museum on a Saturday afternoon.  I ordered a fruit plate to start with and then we were going to share a hamburger.  She asked how I'd like it cooked and I said ""medium"".  

When my fruit plate was dropped off by another person, no silverware or napkins were left.  We started eating the fruit with our fingers.  The waitress walked by and saw us.  I assumed she was going to get silverware.  But then I didn't see her again until she brought the hamburger.  There were so many things wrong at this time.  First, the fact that I had to ask for silverware and napkins in a restaurant is absurd.  Especially seeing that I have 2 children under the age of 4.  I obviuosly need napkins!  But the hamburger was WELL done and absolutely tasteless.  There was nothing on it.  I had to ask for mustard.  When I ordered the hamburger I told her it was for us 3 to split.  She just brought over the hamburger on one plate with no extras.  I had to cut the hamburger into pieces and tear one of our drink napkins to put the burgers on for my kids.
At this point I was so annoyed and tired and wanted to leave.  I asked for the check when she finally walked by a few minutes later (she never came by to ask how anything was).  I didn't even want to bother complaining and waiting to get more food.  After a long day, I just wanted to leave.  But I would never come back again."
1,"I want to give this dump a big fat 0.

My mother and I went this past weekend very hopeful that the food would be good based on the fact they won Best in Madison. How on earth did this place win any award for great food and service is beyond me.


The menu was extremely old, small and the coffee was pure water.  
I order the walleye, hash browns, toast and eggs breakfast.
My mother order biscuits and gravy

My toast was cold, hash browns had no tastes, over easy eggs were not cooked fully and fish was very small in size.

Mothers gravy was too salty and a thick bunch of sop. 

The menu had no coordination. Biscuit,gravy and hash browns? That is nothing but starch!

With that aside,
Not only that but the server was horrible. I felt like she ignored my mother and I the entire time. I understand they were kinda busy. Fine. We can be patient. However, she refilled coffees at her other tables and stopped by to tell the customers their food was being made after waiting for so long. We did not receive such treatment. She passed our table several times and never once asked us how was the food or why our orders were taking so long. Not once.  She was a horrible waitress.

Neither my mother or I could finish our food. I took possibly 4 bites and was done.
We spent less time eating then we did waiting and ordering. Waitress continued to ignore us, so we got up and just walked over to pay.

I told the cashier the food was horrible and I wouldn't be back. She then stated to us that normally the food is good and she wasn't sure why it was taking the kitchen so long and were getting orders wrong.

 But here is the killer... she then leans over and says "" I hate our kitchen staff, we need new ones""

What kind of place does that? You do no throw your co workers under the bus TO CUSTOMERS! I was beyond flabbergasted. 

Just a horrible business, not friendly and food is beyond pathetic. 
Do not go here. I have no idea who in their right mind would vote them as ""Best in Madison"" or give it 5 stars unless you do not have taste buds. 

If you want great food, coffee AND service, go to The Original Pancake House in Monona."
5,"ALICE AND HIS WIFE ARE WONDERFUL, THEY DO A LOT FOR ARIZONA, this restaurant is amazing and all the food is homemade, and the ribs are amazing, and, if you get the footlong hot dog, the bell rings.  This is close to CHASE FIELD AND all of the sites in DOWNTOWN."
1,"I love Dr. Shealey, she is awesome.  However, the ""referral coordinator"" Dawn and ""aide"" Mary are completely rude and condescending.  They do NOT want to help they just want to get you off the phone.  I had and appointment with the Dr. and asked for a referral to bariatrics, because I knew the program required an official referral from my PCP (my patient coordinator had even checked my benefits.  In the mail, Dawn sent me a letterhead stating ""your insurance does not require a referral.""  I called them explaining that although upfront it does not generally require a referral, for this program, and according to the procedure code, it does.  She became very condescending and told me she'd been doing this 15 years and they ""don't do that"" (give the referral I needed, even though Dr. Shealey had said it was a good idea and agreed to....) and continued to transfer me back to Mary who was also very rude and just said ""WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?  MAKE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT AND TALK TO HER!""  They are just horrible!!!!!!!  Pray you never have to talk to anyone but the Drs. there...."
1,"I just had my car in for a auto accident during the visit the shop broke the ignition on the car. They are taking no responsibility and said it was already broken they had the car for a week, if it was already broken how were they able to stop and start the car that whole week! The repairs are going to run more than 600 and they will not even help pay for half. Don't take your car here it was their location on cave creek and hatcher!"
5,Took in two of my watches for new batteries and a band repair. Extremely friendly and prompt service. Very low prices.
5,"""Hey Dan! How's it going?"" 
""It's going good! You?""
""I'm great! Good game last night.""
""Thanks man!""

This is the conversation I had with Dan Majerle the last time I was there. There's NOT a better sportsbar downtown the Majerle's. Great beer selection, great food, great location, and if your luckey you can talk to Dan freaking Majerle! That guy drains 3's and half court shots like a stripper uses her pole. Majerle's is a MUST on game day. Before, after, or both."
1,"The prices are extremely high, i went here tonight with my mom and i didn't even order anything because of the prices, ($15 for a plate of pasta?... Methinks not! ) my mom got calamari and it was really overcooked (i posted a picture!!) she also ordered a fish sandwich and the fish was literally half the size of the bun."
1,"They advertise ""you don't need no teeth to eat our meat."" Well, yes you do! I bought a full rack of baby backs and couldn't wait to get home with them. They were VERY tough... and had very little meat on them."
1,"I won an air conditioner and a heating tune-up through an auction. Upon the initial inspection I was told that everything should be OK but that a newer furnace (mine is 8 years old) was recommended. 

Later, when it was determined I could not afford a new furnace I was told that my venting was not up to code. All Comfort Services would then be happy to sell me a new furnace (to replace one that's only 8 years old) and a new water heater as well as the stuff that goes along with it (plumbing, electrical, etc.) 

So I took it upon myself to hire a home inspector to look things over and was told that everything was fine. The venting was indeed up to code and that there should be no real reason that I couldn't have the A/C and venting work I wanted done with the current set-up. The inspector then also told me he has had trouble with All Comfort Services in the past using similar bait-and-switch tactics to upsell customers into equipment that is not needed (in my case it was to make up for the A/C unit I was getting for much less than the list price I think). 

Emails and phone calls to Kendall Richards, the owner, went unanswered when I tried in vain to get my money refunded to me. Thankfully my credit card company worked with me to dispute the charges and I got my money back. 

I would stay far, far away from All Comfort Services and instead use a more reputable heating and air conditioning vendor."
5,Everything about this place is perfect! The chips & salsa and enchilada's were delicious! I would recommend this place to all my friends!
1,"No shock at all on the numerous bad reviews for Danny's. I wish I would have read them before I took my car in. Why you ask? Here goes:

They stole my change (probably over 15 bucks).
Exterior was dripping with water and back was streaked with mud.
They wrote on the car window, ""basic wash"" and it did not come off after the wash.
If they vacuumed the interior I couldn't tell, I can tell you they didn't vacuum the floor mats, or the driver's side.
They didn't wipe down the interior; there was still dust exactly where I left it.

Normally I would have back to complain, but after waiting over an hour I just wanted to get F out of there. Danny's should take some lessons from Los Olivos, they do a proper car wash.

1 Star is generous."
5,"Red Modern Furniture offers an amazing selection of refurbished danish modern, vintage, 60's mod, and eames era furnishing. The furniture is lovely- but the prices are SKY HIGH. Expect to pay top dollar for you won't find any bargains here. With that being said, it is still worth a trip to Red to salivate over the fantastic pieces."
1,"Wish I could select zero stars!

We were seated at the FURTHEST hightop away from rest of the  patrons. The waitress was friendly, but when a bug was found in a friend's drink, no apology given and no arguement from said waitress when all 5 of us got up and left (despite having a fresh bottle of beer delivered to the table). Ding! Ding! Ding! Probably means that this is not a singular occurrence... Do not go! :(  #gross"
1,"I paid $17.50 for an inside-outside cleaning and was given a dirty car. After agreeing that the car was dirty, the manager refused to have them vacuum it again."
5,"Was visiting Madison for Epic Training last year and came here with some coworkers.

AWESOME!! Everything I had was delicious. Tried escargot for the first time and it was wonderful. It was drenched in some savory buttery sauce and topped with a puff pastry...OMG. We also tried the crab puffs, they were also delicious.

Can't remember exactly what my entree was but it had bacon in it and was great too. The chocolate creme brulee was lovely.

Back in Madison this week and will be going here tomorrow."
5,"I went here on a first date the other day. I've already been here before, but I just got the standard Pad Thai. I know that's just an American thing, so I wanted to try something a bit more Thai. I ordered the Beef Panang, and it was AMAZING. I wanted to eat the whole darn thing, but my stomach wouldn't allow me. That made me so sad, so I'll just have to go back and get some more.

The service was great. We ordered our first drinks from the menu, but our server said he'd just made some fancy shmancy new cocktails the night before, so we just ordered from him and had him give us whatever he'd like. And it was great. The server was super helpful and personable, but he also gave us enough space to chit chat and be on our own.

All in all, a great vibe, great service, great food, and great drinks. I'm going to make this a regular spot for me."
1,"The treatment I endured here was so atrocious it made me activate a Yelp account. I initially came in for a prepaid interior exterior detail package that included a wax. Upon my arrival I agreed to a polish add on/upsell. After retrieving my vehicle  I quickly observed that no detailing had occurred whatsoever;  the inside was still dusty, dirty and there were water stains in my passenger seat. Something shampooing the seats and carpets would have easily removed. It was then that I realized that  what I had originally paid for was not done, only the upsell job. Even that was hard to confirm since they parked my black car across the street under a tree that left it with a coat of green pollen powder all over it. I asked for a manager, Danny, who offered me two free washes and to actually detail the car when I could make it back. I declined the courtesy washes and brought my vehicle back later in the week to be completed. This time when I picked up the car, it was under one of their carports in the detailing area. A staff member gave me my keys with the interior floors and seats wet to the touch. Why would you shut the doors to a car with no way for it to ventilate when the interior is still wet? The mats?  They were wet as well on top of each other locked in the trunk. Why not put them in a dryer? Again, this made no sense. Then, to top it off I noticed that both my Armor All and Meguiar detailing wipes as well as the Ozium I put UNDER my seat were missing. These items were not trash, they were barely used. There was still dirt debris and leaves under my driver seat but they had time to steal my car care products. What a joke! I again asked for a manager to voice my frustration and in return a towel boy came out asking do I still need help with my windows. I ended up just leaving in  utter disgust coupled with shock that places like this really exist. I have encouraged all of my friends, family and co-workers to never, ever give any Danny's location their business. I would implore you to do the same."
1,"By far the worst company I have ever worked wit. If you can avoid Charter do so at all costs. Absolutely terrible customer service and SCAMMERS. I have to call every bill I get because they add charges. 
I have had to call about TV and internet about 10 times in 2 months."
1,"Took an out of town coworker on 1-8-13.  It was very slow, only two other tables so we thought we would get excellent service from Thomas, our waiter.  Well, that didn't happen.  He was MIA most of the night.  In fact, we had to ask another employee to get him so we could order.  Thomas we not very friendly at all and acted like he did not even want to be there.  I still tipped him 20%, because I have worked in the business many years.  My best tip is writing a review and simply not going back.  Simple as that.  Finally, it was a cold night and they did not have the heat on.  Nothing worse than eating and freezing at the same time!  The food? It was just OK"
1,"Steve is a great guy but the gyros and fries fall short of OK let alone great.  First off the gyros always sliced so thin that it quickly burns and curls on spit when cut. That Would put you out of business in Chicago. Next the toppings are weak and need to be improved. The pita is ok but not worthy of my mouth or money. Now the fries, come on guys these fries are greasy and no flavor Steve turn the temp on the fryer to 350 and they will fry properly.  Stop giving us greasy fries they suck buddy.  Gyros needs to be flavorful and juicy you know that, but many places here have no idea how to make that happen.  I wish I could have a gyros like central gyros or costas gyros back home. Your sauce is good but that's just not enough to earn more stars.  I will submit this to the AZ papers as well maybe just selling the business would be best.  The gyros here should be free.  Come Steve better gyros for all is needed.  I mean dry and burnt just doesn't work man. I will be watching this place and informing others if things improve.  Peace."
5,"Great selection of meat and sausage... 

I dropped in on a lark and they had unlimited Skirt Steak... which I couldn't find anywhere else in Madison (totally weird, coming from chicago).  Great quality skirt, required a bit of additional trimming, but that's normal...

will visit Jim again and again"
5,"As a new downtown Phoenix resident, I went in search of a nearby nail salon. I was impressed with Cali nails, and have been going back ever since. They're a great value and knowledgable about the services they offer. Would come highly recommended to downtown Phoenix-ites, or others looking for a great nail spot."
1,"hours posted are wrong. arrived here at 4:45 today, opened door and was greeted by a woman telling me they didn't open until 5:30. well as of now posted hours here are from 4. I get that hours change and not all media gets updated, but their doors were open and their hours reported as such. No offer to be seated and offered a drink anyway or even an incentive to return during new business hours. just a simple we are closed until 5:30 and an escort out.  I repeat, hours posted on this site as of writing this review reflect my attempted patronage. lock your door or update online info or be courteous. there were only 2 of us, and not even a question if there would be more which there wasn't. never been here before. probably will not try again thanks to this experience"
5,"Awesome Mexican Tienda Joint - super friendly staff, almost too many menu choices to choose from - I had what was recommended by the cashier - the steak fajitas - and they were incredible - I left stuffed with tender beef, guacamole, fresh tortillas, peppers, rice, beans, chips, salsa muy rica...  Format is super casual - you order at the counter and if you want to eat it there they bring it out to you in the seating area. While not expected given the format, drop in a tip and you can tell they really appreciate it. 

They have an excellent salsa bar, and sell a wide variety of mexican beer, and it's priced  sooo right.  I'll be back for sure next time I'm in Phoenix."
5,The best Thai in the Phoenix...  This place could hang with the best in the country.  Highly recommend the salad rolls and boat.
1,"how can I get my iPod fixed?  these little snots won't wait on me.  I have to go online to make an appointment, even though I went to the store. They only take appointments for two days ahead, but you have to go on line to do it--- WTF?  You have to make it online? 
And why are they dressed like little Steven Jobs clones?"
5,"The raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing had actual raspberries in it. Ok. Just had to get that off my chest. The dressing surprised me and I'll go back for more than just that. 

We arrived on a Saturday night without a reservation.  I believe we took one of the last tables available until 9 or so. I would have opted for the bar if a table hadn't been available. There are a few high top tables that are seated in an area with live music.  The place is small and intimate. It's the perfect place for a first date. 

We started with the Lemon Parmesan Artichoke Hearts which were nothing like I expected but were rich and flavorful. We weren't terribly hungry so I ordered and appetizer for my entrée and my boyfriend ordered the special. I tried the Crawfish Cheesecake, which, is basically a cheese ball in the shape of a piece of cheesecake. It was tasty and would make the perfect appetizer for a table of four but I wouldn't recommended as a main entrée.

The special was the highlight of the meal. I couldn't repeat it if my life depended on it, but I heard the words: scallops, shrimp and sweet potato  ravioli, pecans, lime something and zucchini... I forgot about the rest of the menu entirely.  I'm not doing the plate any justice with this, but please trust me, it was delicious. The vegetables were perfectly cooked with a lime (something, slightly spicy but still let the veggies shine) sauce that complimented the sweet potato ravioli. Then there were scallops. It was one of those dishes that I couldn't comprehend. All I know is I am anxious to try more of what this chef has to offer."
5,I've been going here since I was a child. It's my parents' go to place for taking visiting family out for dinner. I've seen it go through remodeling and expanding to what it is now. The prices have gone up considerably but the food is as good as ever. Delicious! None of that canned beans shit.
1,"Do not go to DEANS auto repair unless you want to waste half your day and receive a bill you pay to get your car back that is a poor opinion of  what needs to be repaired.  What a joke this place has the b**** to charge $135 to open the hood for a few minutes and sit on the car for an hour and call you back to say you need to clean out your gas lines, and that will be $445.  After you pay the 135 for diagnosing nothing, we will subtract that from the $445, what a deal.  I went there to fix the problem and I was specific at what was wrong, so it was a shock to find out they did nothing.  They could have been honest and said it will cost you $135 for us to just look at it and then you can decide if you want to gamble with us actually doing any work.  I believe they are crooks.   Never will I go to Deans auto joke."
1,"Please do yourself and everyone else a favor by avoiding this rotten place!

Hanger employs a pack of sullen, lazy administrative good for nothings.  We asked them to immediately order and bill our insurance because we were two weeks from our annual plan renewing, which meant $500 out of pocket, in the month I was laid off. 
Nice....

Ten days go by, my wife calls and was told that our insurance didn't cover it, that they would not order without 50% cash down. 

#1 Outright lie from the bitchy woman, they never contacted our insurance company, who will cover Orthotics 100%

#2 Nobody called to inform us that they wouldn't order out without cash up front. (Because they sat on their fat backsides and never did a thing)

The woman my wife contacted early yesterday acted like she cared. But no call back yesterday afternoon or today. I called and they forwarded their calls to an answering service five minutes before 5:00.  Lazy, lazy, lazy. Did I mention nasty and surly?

Go anywhere but Hanger!
FYI, this was the 7th Street location as recommended by my wife's doctor, who is going to get an earful and lose a patient."
1,Business CLOSED... no call cancelling appointment.  Very poor form - purchased a three pack of facial/pedi's and doubt I will see any refund :(
5,"I went here searching for some of my favorite Mexican candies. I struck gold!!
This is a clean, well organized store that has an enormous selection of Mexican candies, many in bulk. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I come here and I stock up on my favorite snacks, and I always try some new ones. I'm never disappointed!"
1,"Not impressed at all.  I went with my husband, and as always he ordered a bean burrito, it was very bland and way over priced.  I had a chicken and a beef taco, the chicken was horrible, and the beef was very dry.  For desert we ordered apple chimichangas which were very good, but how could you mess up deep fried apples and tortillas dipped in cinammon and sugar.  The only  thing good I have to say about this place is that every time I ordered a beer the waitress brought me one immediately and then about 20 minutes later the busboy would bring another out to me thinking I never received the first, either way, no matter how drunk I got the food never tasted good.   I would never go here again."
1,Well they where out of the large cups for shakes. So I got a medium and they still charged me for a large. The service and the shake where both mediocre at best. I will never go back to a cold stone again. Try churn on central at least when you hustled there you get good quality ice cream :-) lol
5,"Ok, I don't usually go too deep into my personal life but this place brings back good memories. My fiancee at the time (whom I've been married to for 15 years now) took me to this place one afternoon. He worked in the downtown area so he was familiar with all the good eats. Surprisingly our food was great. As the years roll by, I take our kids and we sit at the same spot that my husband and I sat during our date 15 years ago. We order the same entree too, lol. This place has several entrees to choose from. My favorite is the Teriyaki Chicken. I know it sounds plain but don't judge a book by it's cover. It's a small hole in the wall but it's clean and not run down. The owners have maintained the business very well. Go to their website for a complete listing of their entrees. By the way, try the Mochi dessert. I don't know whats in it but I LIKE IT ALOT..."
5,This is the most. wonderful church I've ever been to! The masses are beautiful and the people are friendly and welcoming!  I can't imagine going anywhere else.
5,"Loved going to this place. As a night shift worker, this was the best place for a good breakfast and good drink. Recommend highly!"
5,LOVE this place! I eat here on a monthly basis and always have great services and food. It's affordable and quick! Definitely worth checking this place out!
5,"I started bringing my Audi here about 3 years ago. The staff is friendly and forthcoming. Generally speaking, car repairs suck but the mechanics here make the process here easier. Most importantly, I feel like I can trust them. I never feel pressured to get more work done than I can afford and they take the time to explain the repairs to me and answer my questions clearly and respectably. They are just stand up guys."
1,"Hmmmm.... Think I Would Rather Suck Down Your Colonoscopy Bag?

If you are truly looking for a unique dining experience accompanied with old world business cards and lifeless animals, then you will need to try out Texaz Grill all for yourself. If you are looking for good food, solid service, and a nice atmosphere, then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs. If you love low-quality food, poor service, and a revolting atmosphere, then you need to steer your lifted F350 right on over to Texaz Grill.

Wow, from the moment we walked in I knew we were in for trouble ... I just didn't think it could be as bad as it actually was. This is one establishment that will leave you wondering whether the city of Phoenix mandates any sort of cleanliness or health standards. This place is dirty, vile, unkempt, and this is way before we even met our server or received our food.

Just 7:30 PM on a Thursday night, but you would have thought this place was closing up shop for the night or permanently (which wouldn't be a bad thing). Guests are sparse and the few who do remain look like they have chain smoked all of taste buds right out of their mouths. The servers give you the impression they are NOT working for tips and really make no attempt at ensuring a pleasant guest experience. The inside will remind you of a cross between a real, small town BBQ joint and a TGIFridays minus the corporate cleanliness standards. The booths are ancient, uncomfortable, and anything but clean. The walls are littered with business cards, dead animals, used hats, and license plate frames. You will want to write off all the dirt and disaster on the wall as good old Texas charm, but you will quickly realize your appetite fades as each minute passes you by.

So we arrive at our booth and are quickly greeted by our degenerate server who you would have thought was being paid by number of tables she turned over per night. She doesn't look like she wants to be there, and, frankly, neither do we. Our drinks are brought out in a timely fashion, and then she did the best she could to get us to order a quickly as possible. And, we're off....

Orders are put in for a Chicken Fried Steak and the Thursday night BBQ sampler. Our server had to check that there were any of the BBQ samplers left which should tell you that this combination was probably made yesterday and has been hanging around all day. The salad came quick - too quick. Within two minutes of ordering, I had the misfortune of choking down a brown, bland, and boring salad. Of course, nobody goes to a BBQ joint for a salad, but I think most prefer green lettuce and more than two dressing choices.  Not even ten minutes later and our entrees had arrived, and we suddenly had enough food to feed an entire homeless shelter but I have my doubts of them even touching this piss poor attempt at Texas BBQ.

Chicken Fried Steak - imagine about 1oz of beef shankle meat breaded in a pound of breading and smothered in some alien gravy. The meat was bland, veiny, chewy, and not even good enough for my neighbor's dog. You get two of them and each one will be bigger than your head, but I'm not really sure what you are supposed to do with them because they are anything but edible.

BBQ Sampler - I would have rather have sampled what was soaked up in the dirty bar rag or growing out of the rug. The ribs were too fatty and smothered in the generic BBQ sauce that made this place famous. The brisket was boring and overcooked. The Texas fries were not fries, nor were they good. The sausage was edible, but more so in a comparative way. Even the bread was terrible.
 
The food can be summed up as atrocious, inedible, poor quality, and even hard to look at. Truly some of the worst food I have ever eaten or looked at in my entire life. The highlight of the night was easily when our server seemed astonished we refused the to-go box. Sorry, but you should have been shaking our hands for even trying to make a meal out of those make-me-want-to-go-vegetarian plates of meat. 

It is worth mentioning that Texas Grill does two things and two things only correctly. You will be seated quickly to ensure that the dead animals or the plethora of 1970s business cards stapled to the walls don't scare you away and the plastic soft drink mugs are gigantic, but I'm sure this was implemented to minimize server interaction with the tables.

Go grab a McRib or two before you throw away any money at this place...or be ready to pop some serious laxatives. Outside of some rough drinking nights, I have never felt the urge to vomit all over the place 15 hours after a meal. Good luck to you if you choose this place. If you do decide to go, don't forget to bring your business card - it might be old enough to go up on the wall in 2032 - that is, assuming this place is around much longer."
5,Such a jewel here in Phoenix.    The Heard Museum has one of  the best Native American presentations.     It is well thought out and exhibits continue to change to wet your appetite for another visit.    It is a must visit whenever you are in Phoenix.   I highly recommend that you visit the Heard Museum.
1,"Came here looking for a couple of house plants as well as a couple of plants for my balcony. Had a list of potential things but I don't have a green thumb and know little to nothing about plants. Walked around for 30 minutes with a paper in hand, looking around clearly lost and overwhelmed and wasn't greeted once or asked if I needed help. I eventually gave up and left defeated with no plants. Pretty big selection, but probably won't come back because of this."
1,"This place is just as pretentious and uncomfortable as any uncomfortable and pretentious place I have ever had the displeasure of wasting my time and money. 
The food was boring, the service was unfriendly and almost non existent, parking was lousy, the food is overpriced, and the ambiance, if any, was drowned out by the incessant blaring music. 
This is the typical place where people with lap tops sit around discussing their greatest business and work ventures making sure everybody around them is, of course, aware how great they are and how cool they are. 
I don't recommend this place to any body that actually knows what good food is, what good ambiance is, and what good service is."
5,"My husband and I stopped in here on a freezing Sunday morning.  It's a small place,  but doesn't seem too crowded.  We had eggs benedict, and it was VERY good. Prices  they charged were more than reasonable for the quality of food,   and the waitstaff was super nice. As people who drink coffee black,  it's very hard to find small places like this that you need no cream or sugar to make the coffee palatable,  and luckily this was one such place. So really,  nice atmosphere, good food, nice waitstaff,  don't even bother going anywhere else for breakfast."
5,"Hands down my favorite place for Chinese food in Madison. Consistency is key for me and IG is always consistent. The pace is slower than some restaurants, but it's worth the extra time. We eat here at least 4-5 times a year and it's always a great night with great service. 

Cashew Chicken, egg roll, shrimp rangoon and a glass of wine = LOVE!"
1,"Absolutely horrible.  

The building has been recently remodeled because it burned.  I'd guess the insurance company didn't cover a replacement broom, vacuum and cleaning supplies. My arms stuck to the new table, the floor was really littered with garbage and my silverware was dirty.  Gross.  It was 2pm on Sat and dead.  No excuse for dirty.

The waitress was really nice, I think her name was Sarah.  She was personable and attentive.  She's the only reason I'd give this place a star at all.

I ordered a Gyro sandwich.  It came with fries and a bowl of soup.  I ordered Broccoli Cheese soup.  I think if I heated up some Velveeta and added a gallon of water to it, then tossed in a bunch of dirty, uncut broccoli, I could duplicate the Sir Hobo recipe.

I wish the rest of the meal was that good.  When the Gyro arrived, it reeked of rotten deer carcass, the plate was filthy and the fries were colder than Alaska in December.  I'm not joking.  The Gyro tasted so bad that I had to spit a mouthful of it into a napkin and slug down a glass of water to cleanse the horse-s--t taste from my mouth.  

Sarah noticed that I hadn't eaten my food, she offered to remove it from the bill with out me asking.  I would normally applaude that gesture, but some older foreign lady (I assume the owner) came over and told her not to do that.  ""I'll make you new sandwich,"" said the old lady. I declined.  I figured I couldn't choke down another bite of the garbage they call food.  I paid my 9 dollars for a lousy cup of liquid Velveeta and left.

I bet the Dairy Queen across the parking lot is glad that Sir Hobo's is back open.  I wonder how many people have done what I did... walk to DQ and had an ice cream cone to try to clean the aftertaste of death and decay from my mouth.  Never again.  I'd go to DQ instead."
5,"I have been here twice, both times for breakfast. Both times I was *very* happy. 

I had the greek omelette (feta cheese, spinach, you know the deal) and thought I had died and gone to omelette heaven. Best I ever had. It came with this delicious tzaziki-type sauce on the side, which I should have brought home with me (I did finish the omelette at the restaurant). 

The second time I had this very interesting strawberry fritter french toast. I love french toast and all things sugary, and this was definitely sweet. It sort of had a filling (that was the strawberry part). It was delicious, but not for those who claim they don't like sweets. 

The service is terrific, very fast and genuine. The coffee is hot and just right. 

You'll likely be surrounded by various old men (with the occasional younger man sprinkled in), but these old guys know a good breakfast when they find one."
5,"There are plenty of reviews to demonstrate the fortitude and cache of Coronado Cafe, so I will simply say that this is a sweet little spot for a lunch date. 

My girlfriend and I had our second date here as one of those safe, sans alcohol, 'is this the one?' dates, which came off perfectly and pleasantly and I looked like the f'in man for suggesting it.  Sucker.  Just kidding.  I love you baby.  Heh."
1,There shouldn't even be an option for a star. The service is horrible and bartenders are very rude. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone not even my worst enemy!
1,The employees here need some serious training. They have no concept of customer service. They also have supply chain issues (always out of product and never know when it is coming in). I have tried Marvel a few times and each time the experience got worse. Will never go back now.
1,"just ew.

dirty bathrooms.
plastic-y vegetables.
watery gravy.
bland mashed potatoes.
iceberg lettuce and pink tomato ""salad.""

this is the taco bell of diners...the food is cheap for a reason. do yourself a favor and skip it. when denny's food looks fresh in comparison, you know you're in the wrong place.

*sigh*

5,"Hey Yall...i knew i would find EXACTLY what I was looking for...I want to tell me peers when they fly in, but I want to keep her a secret....I LOVE ROSITAS...Carmen was my prompt and courteous server...i I ordered the carne asada burrito enchilada style with rice and beans it came with a side of guacamole and a little lettuce salad. The Carne Asada Steak inside of this burrito was totally undeniably freakin awesome, awesome like a FOODGASM in my mouth the meat was tender, flavorful, juicy, and I could see & taste the spices WHERE IN THE HELL do they do that at well let me tell you ROSITAS. This has to be one of the best things I've ever eaten since I've been in Phoenix, Arizona. The mom and pop setting remind me of home the loud crazy people didn't bother me it's a small restaurant it's time to be expected. Don't do yourself an injustice by leaving if it's crowded what are your items to go. I love guacamole but I didn't enjoy this one because I could tell they add Southwest spices and I like mine plain."
5,"Quite possibly the best optometrist I have ever been to, and I have been seeing optometrists for almost 20 years.

Everyone here is SUPER nice. They make a point of cleaning all of the equipment you are going to be touching right in front of you. And (my favorite part) they don't do the puff test! They have this little contraption that touches your eye (I thought it would freak me out, but it was fine.) - WAY less stress than the damn puff test.

I will definitely be going here from now on for eye exams."
5,Been coming here since I was a little girl . I'm salvadorian myself and their pupusas are the best in AZ !!
1,"Food poisoning for two, please...

I am really confused by all the 4-star and 5-star reviews for this place. The 4-star average Yelp rating was the reason my wife and I chose to dine here during our stay in Phoenix. Yelp, you really let us down this time.

So I was on company business travel in Phoenix the week of March 12th and my wife was traveling with me. We had a French impulse that Tuesday night and tried to crash Petite Maison in Scottsdale, only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available. The following night, still craving French cuisine, we decided to stop in at Sophie's French Bistro in Phoenix.

The first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours. However, encouraged by the strong reviews on Yelp, we decided to go ahead and order. We took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following...

3 Cheese Plate
Chef's Pate
Calamari
Crispy Duck Breast
Creme Brulee

The food was average at best. My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it, and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was. Most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency.

The fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room. We both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning, followed by the onset of stomach pain. No big deal, I thought... 

By shortly after midnight, we were each fighting for time in the bathroom, taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night. I'll try to spare you the details, but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that I have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life. Needless to say, diarrhea was also involved.

After going through this for a good two hours, my wife and I were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated. My wife even told me she felt like she was dying, and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth. o.O

So by around 2:30am, my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance. For a while, neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone. I eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly. I carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital.

We drove to John C. Lincoln Hospital on Dunlap, which I recommend if you ever get poisoned by Sophie's French Bistro. I managed to get there without hitting anything, which was remarkable since I could barely see straight and could barely function at all. 

Once inside, my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly. The nurses and doctors rushed her into the ER and brought her back around. They gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an IV drip of fluids. As I waited, I continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated. Despite being in a hospital, I was determined not to check myself in for treatment, not wanting to add further medical bills.

Sometime around 5:00am, my wife was ready to be discharged. The official diagnosis was acute food poisoning. We were never able to identify the specific meal at Sophie's which poisoned us, as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts each.

However - and this is the kicker - when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was Sophie's, they remarked ""oh, that place!"". We learned that the ER at John C. Lincoln has seen 3 other cases of food poisoning caused by Sophie's. The hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against Sophie's with the AZ Department of Health Services. They told us that once they have at least 10 confirmed cases, then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreak.

This all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place. I can only assume that the other poisoning victims either don't use the internet, or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere, too weak to write a review.

Please, please, PLEASE don't put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night. After this experience, we lost all desire to dine in Phoenix ever again. Thanks, Sophie's, for ruining our trip.

For the record, we did have an excellent meal at CIBO Pizza the night before we were poisoned. I highly recommend CIBO. Great food, without food poisoning."
1,"Uuugh!!!! What a rip off. I came in from out of town and hung out with my buddy Joe. He highly recommended JT's because of their awesome wings and tiny tacos. What he didn't know was that most of the positive reviews of this place on Yelp are ancient reviews from when Julio was still working there. This place had the kiss of death and was taken over by cheap, shady owners. The new owners want to cut cost but still cash in on the positive word of mouth about the food. They also raised the prices. So in essence, the new owners are producing a cr@p product and charging us more money! To add insult to injury they shorted us 2 chicken wings. Talk about trifflin'!! If they're shorting people wings, I'd hate to know what they're doing to their drinks. When we got them they were cold all the way down to the bones and stale like they had been made as a mistake earlier in the day, boxed up and given to us (short 2 wings!!!). The tacos were bland like they just cooked some ground beef without seasoning and threw it in the shell. I added the salsa to try to add some flavor to it but it didn't cut it. I'm sure MY taco has more flavor than this one did. Most of the wings and tacos are still in the fridge and will inevitably meet their fate at the bottom of the garbage can. In conclusion, if you want over priced, piece of cr@p wings that don't taste half as good as frozen ones and tacos that taste better when they come out of you than going in, go to JTs so they can pi$$ on you face and tell you it's raining!
*Additionally, don't believe the review underneath mines. I'm almost 100% positive it was done by someone who works for them or has some sort of affiliation with this place. It's written like an advertisement. The wings look NOTHING like they do in that picture. This review would be VASTLY different if they did. Our wings were all limp and flaccid when they showed up to film. Nice try you guys. You make me sick."
5,"This is the real-deal Mexican food in Arizona. (Not to be confused with Rosita's local chain of restaurants.) Home-cooked goodness. Freshly cooked chips, spicy red and green salsa. Try the chicken chilie relleno or a green chili burro enchilada style.  For you meat purists, check out the sauteed beef burro or the carnitas burro(!). It's all soooo good - not a bad item on the menu. Go to Rosita's Place - you'll be glad you did."
1,"I was so disappointed after reading all of the reviews.  Firstly, breakfast stops at 11:00 on weekdays and noon on the weekends, NOTE THAT because when we showed up today after my husbands late night shift the night before they would not serve us breakfast.

CASH OR CHECK ONLY

Worth noting, both menus are pretty slim, but breakfast is larger than lunch.  

They were out of the fried chicken ""dinner"" (you mean lunch, since they were only open till 2, right?). We ended up ordering the patty melt, ok, fish sandwich, subpar, and onion rings, good but not $3 good. Sandwiches come with chips, not fries.  But was definitely not the pancakes that everyone else was raving about that I was craving.  The coffee was sting but a bit bitter. The total was just under $20 without tip. 

The decor is old, doesn't bother me too much, but looking at the filthy carpets, it was disgusting and I was a bit afraid since I was wearing flat sandals.  Before I forget to mention it, the place smells like smoke when you first walk in, I was completely expecting to see ashtrays at the booths.

The service was excellent... If you are a regular. If not, plan on spending about three times too much there. We waited for about 5 minutes for our waitress ( one of the owners) to shout sit where you want.  We grabbed a table. My husband had to take a work call, but had given me his order. After waiting 10 minutes, I had to flag our waitress down to place our orders, and she looked at me shocked that I would want something to eat. Trying to get the check out of her was terrible. By 12:15 the lunch regulars had started coming in, so she was chatting about a recent wedding, showings hem the wedding pictures, talking about what the place looked like, etc. by 12:30 I had out cash on the end of the table hoping to move things along.  She walked past us three times without making eye contact, finally, I put my arm out and asked for the check, which had not been prepared, wait for another 5 minutes while she served more regulars and FINALLY she got back to using we were out of there by 12:50. 

In short, we will never return.  It is expensive for what you get, food is unremarkable, serve is terrible, and it seemed like it could use a food service inspection because it was pretty dirty."
5,"This is where it's at! If you are looking for really good, cheap and somewhat late night (I think they are open till 11pm) mexican food, you've got to try Rosita's. I absolutely loooove their mole sauce-- best in the Valley. Try the beans and rice burro, enchilada style with mole.  Pair it with a nice cold Pacifico-- Sunday afternoon Heaven! Their salsas are to die for, and both the red and green pack some serious punch!  You've got to pay a dollar for chips, but it's so worth it. The tamales are also muy delisioso!

The little old ladies who work here are absolutely adorable in their little matching dresses. They are no nonsense, too. There's a sign posted that says ""Please control your children!"" I love it. Plus, they have a kick-ass temporary tattoo machine at the front where you can buy ""Dogz"" tattoos, with realistic looking dogs in gangsta settings. Classic."
5,"The meatloaf in every form is superb. There are three options, meatless, sandwich, and entree, and they are all 'of the gods.' Absolute favorite place."
5,It was terrific in every aspect.  I had no idea there was such a reservoir of talent here - in every area of theatre.
5,"This is it - the cream of the crop.  

I've lived in the Madison area for the past two years, have visited many of the local Indian buffets, and have found none that equal the Maharaja standard.   Buffet dishes change on a daily basis, but you can always count on their show-stopping chicken tikka masala to be in the mix.  In addition to the standard meat curries and tandoori chicken, they always offer multiple vegetarian dishes and an array of appetizers.  

Recommendations:  coconut soup, vegetable korma, malai kofta, baingan bhartha, chicken tikka masala, mango ice cream

The staff is wonderful and always keeps plates of naan a plenty :)

Maharaja is by far one of Madison's best restaurants.  And, you can't beat their lunch buffet deal (under $10).   But diners beware, it is incredibly easy to overeat at this place...forcing one into an almost immediate food coma upon settling the check."
1,"what a wasted oppotunity.  
Native American culture is so rich and the traditions so deep but they focus about 5 percent on this and 95 percent on being displaced and anger at reservation life and .. hold on.  dont bash.  i understand that they were wronged.  i am Japanese American and I KNOW what it is like to get land taken away and hearing stories about being a tax paying citizen and get taken to jail.  but ... i just wish the focus was on the beauty of the traditions and cultures.  i really wanted to take away more from it.  maybe i went in with expectations to high?  i live in hawaii so i see alot of ancient cultures and traditions and thought this place would be similiar.  and for 12 bucks a person to go there... at least parking was free! and there seems to be interactive things for kids too!"
5,Very nice lunch food. Carnitas are awesome and the white chocolate tamales are a nice finish.
5,"totally yummy food!  I love their appitizer veggie sampler, and their desserts are good too.  I recommend the thai custard."
1,"Came back after two weeks because I still was sick.  The registration staff was still just as nice and helpful.    Although there was no line, I saw the doctor for approximately 90 seconds.  He said you're back; I told him what was going wrong and he told me his plan and left.    I doubt my co pay and health insurance appreciated such a pathetic effort.  


I won't be coming back, there are other places where I'll be seen and treated for a bit longer."
1,"tuna sandwich was ok. (if you like cheap tuna dripping with more olive oil than 3 salads would need.) kind of pricey for a plain sandwich , no drink etc. bread was good but that was about it."
5,"Bruce Co installed our back patio this week. We shopped around to get quotes for identical specs (same pavers, dimensions, services, warranties) from other local companies-- bigger companies like Barnes and small companies. Bruce Co came up less expensive than the others, included landscaping (when we didn't ask for it in the quote), were easy to work with, and offered a cash back incentive. The workers came out early on the day they were supposed to arrive and worked the entire time. They did an awesome job, were very thorough in their clean up and yard mending (from where they brought in the materials), and were friendly and professional.

I highly recommend working with them."
5,"I have been a patient of Doctor Johnstone's since approximately 04/2007.  I have seen her through thick and thin, joys and sadnesses, 2 breast lump scares, abnormal papsmears, etc.  No matter what troubles and health concerns God presented me with, Dr. Johnstone was there to calm me, lend an ear to any and all of my concerns, and to move forward with appropriate treatments.

I was overjoyed last May to learn that my husband and I were expecting our first child.  I could not wait to go to Dr. Johnstone's office to tell her the news & talk with her about the prenatal care that was to come.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that it's a 45 minute to a 1 hour drive to Dr. Johnstone's office, my husband asked if I could please find a doctor closer to our home in North Scottsdale to go to for the prenatal care as he did not see any sense in driving so far south to frequent appointments when there were perfectly capable doctors much closer to home.

Hesitantly, I agreed to switch doctors.  I asked my primary care physician at Mayo Clinic Thunderbird who she would recommend and she gave me the name of an OBGYN only about 15 minutes from my home.  My husband and I visited them for several appointments.  The doctor and the office staff were courteous and nice.  They seemed to know what they were doing/talking about.  However, this doctor WAS NOT Dr. Johnstone.  I missed her, her patience with my questions, her terrific way of explaining things to me in a way I could understand, etc.  

After I cried and cried to my husband to PLEASE let me switch back, I returned to Dr. Johnstone late in my 2nd trimester for the remainder of my pregnancy.  My baby is due Feb 7th 2013 & I couldn't be happier I made this decision.  I could not imagine anyone other than doctor Johnstone delivering this baby.  

I have read the reviews others have posted regarding not being pleased with the front desk/office staff.  I have not had that experience.  They are running a business and sometimes they are very busy and down to business, but I find that if you greet them with a positive attitude, a smile, and your respect, they will be equally respectful to you.  

I would definitely recommend Dr. Johnstone and her practice to anyone.  It is true sometimes they run behind and you need to wait to be taken back for your appointment a little late.  I am not put off by this as I worked for Social Security for approximately 8 years and I understand what it's like to fall behind when giving your full time and attention to each individual as they deserve.  Also, I would imagine it would be reasonable to think some patients may be a little late for their appointments causing the whole office to fall a little bit behind.  It does not turn me off at all, and I will gladly continue driving the distance for this high quality of care (& genuine caring) in the future."
1,"Alex A. was craving some Chinese food, so we headed over to the Chinese Cultural Center and decided on trying Lao Ching Hing. I should first say that I'm from an area that's saturated with Chinese restaurants, so I have pretty high standards for Chinese food. Lao Ching Hing fell far short of those standards. 

At first glance, it seemed like a pretty nice restaurant. They invested a lot in very nice traditional-looking furniture, which I don't see often. So I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of the place. We were the only patrons when we went, so I can't really complain of bad service since we were the only ones being served.

We ordered the stir-fried string beans (my all-time favorite dish) and the salt and pepper pork. They were both so bad :( The string beans were under-seasoned and not really cooked the way it should have been cooked. In that particular dish, the beans should have been dried. It seems like they sort of skipped that step or didn't complete that step. So instead of nice crunchy beans, we got squeaky beans. The pork chops were worse though. I'm thinking it was at least a day old - you could taste the old oil - and they probably just re-heated it (we definitely heard a microwave go off). And that old oil taste stayed in my mouth long after dinner was over. Not pleasant.

I think Panda Express has better-quality food than this place. I will not be returning."
5,"I have been here twice in three months and I live in Flagstaff. Always a great experience, great food, great service!"
1,"Not a fan.  Had the sesame chicken lunch combo and did not like it at all.  The soup if a veggie and if you want egg drop it's a $1.00 more, the fried rice has nothing fried it's just yellow rice.  The chicken was hard and the sauce wasn't good.  It was just not a good experience."
1,"It is not delicious, but the service is good."
1,the arizona center is to phoenix as the galleria is to scottsdale.  can you say white elephant?
5,"We went here over the summer and I still dream about the biscuit that comes with the breakfasts.

The wait for brunch was long, but the free papers and indoor/outdoor waiting area made it entirely bearable. 

The menu, as others have mentioned, is very very vegetarian friendly. We tried the pesto + mushroom omelet, which was original and delicious, as was the spinach + feta omelet. 

We also tried a recommended milk shake, which was worth the splurge. 

This will be the first place we stop next time we are in Madison.

Our server was friendly and everything we ordered was delicious."
1,"This place CANNOT EVER give me everything I order. They are the most worthless, slack jawed, habitual screw up's I have ever witnessed. Not only do they always forget something, but half the menu will take ""another 16 minutes"" according to the drive up attendant. Dont ever stop here!!!!!You will regret it!!!!Check your order before you pull away at least!!!"
5,"BOMB breakfast! We must have arrived at the perfect time because when we left there were people waiting on tables and chairs outside.

Great service and everything was authentic!"
5,Recently went with Carl for my wedding cake. The wedding cake tasted AMAZING and the design that Carl came up with was simple and very classy. Carl is very nice and I felt that the cake was very reasonably priced. Thanks so much!
5,"I took my truck to get an oil change and inspection. Robert was super friendly and knowledgeable. They did a great job and even picked me up from work. The only thing I didn't receive was the truck wash I was told I'd get (not the important part). Overall, great mechanic!"
1,"Went to central ave location. Dry pulled pork,you NEED teeth to try to eat it,rubbery,bun was soaked on the bottom with? Won't go back,waste of money,tables were dirty too."
5,"This place is wonderful.  One, Almost anything on the menu can be made gluten free.  Two, They have about 7 different types of loose teas to choose from.  Three, The food is GREAT!

My favorite dishes are the Three Delicacies Sizzling Rice Soup and  the Tofu Lettuce Wraps.  I am not lying when I say that I have NEVER had a dish I didn't like here.  The food is never greasy, never oversauced and never overcooked.  The seafood and veggies always have a really fresh taste... I seriously have no complaints at all.

I miss you."
5,Everything about this place is wonderful!! I love the huge windows and outdoor patio! Gorgeous! Their food is amazing everything from the chips (there are about 5 different chips in the basket) and salsa to dessert! They have some of the best margaritas in town! Yum! My favorite thing on the menu is the goat cheese stuffed chicken with roaster red pepper sauce! This is to die for!!
5,"GREAT music and tons of fun! LOVE the music!! Fridays is mainly for ""cheros"" aka
guys that wear pointy boots with matching belts as they play that kind of music. Not
really my thing but can be fun if you got your buzz going. Saturdays is hip hop,
reggaeton, and house music which is the main day it gets POPIN!  After 2 it turns 18
and over-never really stayed after 2am so don't know how that it. 
NOTE: Karambas is not a place to go looking for guys or a dress to impress kind of
place.  It kind of reminds me of a club I used to go to in Juarez except with alot more
eye candy.  The atmosphere is very fun and people don't really go there to mingle its
more of a place to with your friends and have a good time without having to impress
anyone.  From experience usually the people who don't like going here are the people who are looking for someone else or sad to say ugly lol not to be rude but its true.
Bathrooms: Yea they're kinda small but um im there to party... if your worried about the
bathrooms LMAO please don't go out or maybe drag a urinal with you.  
Prices: People say their over priced but honestly i thought they were cheap... if your
hard up for cash look extra sexy so a cute Latino will buy your drinks for u duh!"
1,"If you could leave a 0 star review for Danny's, that's what they would get -  not even one.  Maybe it's my mistake for leaving my iPOD in the back of the car, in the gym back, in the zippered pocket and in the armband, but paying $20 for a car wash and losing a few hundred dollars in stolen property...
They did leave the earphones, though.  Lucky me."

5,"We ate here during lunch on Sunday and I can't understand why this place wasn't packed. They have the best vegetarian fajitas, chips and salsa that I've ever had...and I eat Mexican food a lot. The chips are mixed, some are won tons, some are sweet potato crisps and some are seasoned corn chips...all mixed together. Our waiter explained that the salsa takes two days to make the concoction of roasted vegetables. I had my free checkin dessert to go...and there was a lot to choose from. If I lived in the area, I would definitely frequent this place."
5,Ryans is a such a great find! They have animal products for such a cheap price and the more you buy the more you can save! There is a minimum 25 dollar purchase but i always....ALWAYS spend more because there is so much stuff for such a good price. The place is setup like a warehouse..because it is....and isn't the prettiest place I have ever shopped but for the prices..you deal.  I keep coming back!
1,it was a dump. There was no one around to help. and half the machines were down.
1,"Really not sure how to rate it since the service sucks so bad. Pretend it's a 1 1/2 star I guess.

For the second time in a week I've received my Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger with no bacon. How does that happen?

Other incidents have included but are probably not limited to: a mysteriously soggy bun, buns that were harder than they should have been, missing food and other various problems typically associated with these type of eateries.

I know it's fast food but come on people. Get it together!

Also keep an eye out for your straw as this Wendy's is notorious for giving you your drink and then giving you nothing to drink your drink with. I don't know why Wendy's insists on putting the straw in the bag since they more often than not forget to.

If it weren't opened 24 hours and I wasn't such a gluten for punishment I'd never go here.

Dave was cool, this Wendy's is not!"
5,"This place is close to the museum so we thought we'd give it a try.  YAY!  and  YUM!  The pulled pork was worth the drive from San Diego.  My sister from Alabama saw the peach cobbler on the menu and spoke with the cook who assured her it was fresh, hand peeled peaches and homemade.  My sister is quite the critic of peaches.  OK, the peach cobbler is the best there is.  No comparison - excellent *****.  Eat here you won't be disappointed!"
5,"You know what's great? Walking into a banking establishment and having the tellers know your name! I've been with Sunwest for 27 years, and I've never had any fees charged to me (yay automatic and free overdraft protection!) Your mileage may vary, but I love these guys. This branch is fantastic. All the employees are friendly and knowledgeable."
1,"I have eaten at Luke's for some time now. I am not from Chicago so I can't offer any feedback on authenticity but it is usually pretty good. 

I am not sure what's up with the owner. I assume him to be the salt and pepper haired guy who appears to be in charge. No one working there seems happy and like many other reviewers have already said the fat dark hair man working the counter is a business killer. I would have to guess he is driving off 10s of customers a day minimum. The owner is either blind or just doesn't care because the rude treatment goes on when he is right there. 

Time for Luke to thrown in the towel or make some big changes.  Start by firing the rude #%ck at the counter."
5,"I've gone here for many different events and the stadium never fails. Everything is so big and nice, even the bathrooms are nice! The seats are not rock hard like other stadiums. Parking is everywhere around the place and theres always spots so you don't have to walk far."
1,"Why do we stop here and eat? It's cheap, It's fast, the name is familiar? Probably one or all those reasons. But we could be so much kinder to our digestive track if we would just explore out side the box! I once went 15 years without eating at a Taco Bell. Why did I try it again? Must have been an advertisement over powered me. I can be strong again and refuse to eat this crap once again or forever."
1,"First let me say that the food was good. Second let me say that I am a 25 year veteran owner of bars and restaurants. I know intricately how they run and the types of people they employ. We ate there on 2/13. My date was a professional Triathlete. She does not drink when in training. To be responsible I only ordered one glass of wine ($15). The server with the Brit accent was rude and condescending from that point on. His response was a miffed ""just one glass "" repeated back snarkily. I ordered 2 apps, a split salad, and two entrees and dessert.  He was pained to inquire if it was good and we had to fight to get our water glasses filled. He attempted to hurry us out, all the while kissing the asses of the regulars at the adjacent table. He didnt let us even get halfway through the dessert before unceremoniously dumping our check. I then had the gall to pay with a Capital One credit card. The asinine snob opened the check folder in front of us, looked down and made a sour looking face. 

It was clear that 1. he was pissed that there was no bottle of wine ordered to bump his tip. 2. His perception of Capital One cards was that only low class and credit crunched losers own them. I recently got divorced and my Ex destroyed our credit, Sorry Mr Bean but thats what i paid with. I left a 20% tip because it is my custom from owning restaurants.

So if the owners or management of Vincents read this please understand that I had on a custom hand made shirt, new Gucci Loafers, and a $12,000 Franck Muller watch. I chose your restaurant, i CHOSE not to drink, I chose to pay with a non-status credit card, and I will most certainly CHOOSE not to return based on the entirely unacceptable and highly offensive behavior of  my server based on the his uneducated and insulting perceptions. I left a $30 tip because I choose to so the bus boys and other staff would be tipped out. This idiot waiter that was ONLY concerned with his tip needs to learn that his customers are often much more intelligent then he is, and that gratuities are earned for service. Good service, not rude, condescending, childish, idiocy based on his perception of who his clients are. He clearly misconstrued who and what I was, and did the ""look down at the tip and thank you graciously at the door"" after he saw his grubby $30 left on my low class credit card. 

As a side note, I might have ordered a full bottle of wine had I been impressed with your wine list. It just happens that I am a dealer and collector in ultra-rare California Cult Cabs and prefer to drink exceptional bottles when I do drink more then one glass. In fact snotty ass server, I doubt that you have the connections or financial resources to obtain one bottle, more or less the 1000 that I have in my home. Im sure your $750,00 home, that you were so proudly gloating about to the next table, is much nicer then mine too, I mean I only drank one glass and paid for it on a cheesy card!

Run the other direction unless you want a true French experience- treated rude rude rude for no reason other then greed, insecurity and jaded crass immaturity. There are plenty of places to eat where the server would be grateful for a $30 gratuity. Its not Europe, gratuities are discretionary. This ass of a server just has an unearned sense of entitlement. WORTHLESS PLACE"
1,"Was not greeted or assisted when I came in. The place is disorderly and dirty looking. Finally when I figured things out on my own I waited for the ladies to finish their conversation about whatever trivial weekend blunder they were talking about. Kimberly was the raised eyebrow, gum chewing teller indifferent to the clients needs. She input the information from my sheet, and tried to tell me that if the recipient is not there upon first delivery, UPS sends it back to the sender and that I should get additional services added.  I'm no shipping pro but obviously they take it back to the nearest UPS store and leave a note at the door.  I then said that I was ok without extra services and said ""I don't care how it gets there as long as it actually gets there"" in a friendly way. She then half rolled her eyes and smirked and said ""I don't care either"" in a smart a** way.  Her smart attitude was a turn off considering I'm usually patient with lazy service people. All In all I do not recommend this store I don't feel trustful or secure in sending my important document with them, I'm afraid it could get lost now- I checked the status I my shipment using the tracking number and it says its not available.  Don't recommend, find another location to ship from. :)"
1,"Went there on Saturday night to get some food to go. On of the worst Chinese Buffets I've seen. Half of the trays were empty and other half were almost empty. Very little selection. The worst pay is the take out prices: $10.50 to get a to go box(should be under 2lb) and 40 cents for every ounce after, WTF is that!!! So we just went somewhere else that night and didn't dine there at all. Bottom line: EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE."
5,Mmmmm....one of my all time favorite restaurants in the valley.  I've loved everything I have eaten here.  If you like your salsa hot be sure to ask for the habanero salsa with your chips.  Can't resist the bakery items. They have the freshest Mexican pastries I have ever found in the valley. If you are in the mood for seafood take a trip into the store. Go into the back where the seafood counter is located and they have fresh seafood tostadas that are to die for !!!  There's nothing like a lazy Saturday morning...you take a trip to RM for a bowl of home made menudo and tortillas then you come home and take a GIANT NAP !!!
5,"Delicious food. Small and casually intimate atmosphere with friendly cooks.

Really loved the beet salad!"
5,"How good is Sam's? Well, I just got back from eating dinner here, and I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do more than write this review -- that's how good it is. 

I'm in town for business and a buddy who lives in the area suggested this place for dinner tonight, and boy am I glad he did! 

Let me start with the ambiance. Very nicely decorated and furnished in the Southwestern style that is common down here but done nicely, not gaudy or tacky in any way. There is a nice outside patio seating area, however considering I'm from Seattle and the temp was still pushing 100 degrees, we opted to sit inside.

Once we were seated, we were tempted to order the ""Limit-2"" margaritas that they are apparently famous for, but decided against it. After taking our drink order, the waitress brought us a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.

Let me stop right here.

I knew just from looking at them, that these were no ordinary chips . Not only were they a mixture of different types of chips (regular tortillas, sweet potato, and wontons), but each type was topped in a different seasoning -- my favorite being the wonton chips topped in seasoning and some powdered sugar, giving it a sweet and spicy flavor at the same time. Amazing. I asked the waitress what the seasoning but I swear they were laced with cocaine as well. Hands down the best chips and salsa I've ever had in my life. I would go back just for that!

Once we overcame the confusion of what the ""Super Salad"" was (it turns out she was asking if I wanted soup OR salad), I ordered the Pueblo House Salad to start with. It was a very nice sized salad (could easily have been shared by two people if someone wanted to), and delicious with their honey chipotle vinaigrette dressing.

For the main course, I opted for the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast, which came off the ""Sam-Mex"" section of the menu. According to the menu, ""Sam-Mex"" was created by their executive chef with ""the influence of Mexican, Spanish, Native American and American Southwest Cultures."" The chicken breast was stuffed with herb-goat cheese and served over a roasted red pepper cream sauce with a pine nut & cilantro pesto, grilled asparagus and southwest rice.

Words cannot describe the amazing fusion of these different flavors as they combined into one superbly mind blowing dish.

I'll be honest, it was hard to concentrate on the conversation with my buddy as I was distracted each time I took a bite -- but don't let him know I said that!
 
At the end of the meal, as we opted not to order dessert (or the crazy margarita), we were treated to what the waitress referred to as ""white chocolate tamales,"" compliments of the chef. Of course, know that I have read some of the other reviews on here, it seems that everyone gets these little treats, but whether the chef really intended for us to specifically have them or not was a mute point after tasting them -- a great finishing touch on an amazing meal. 

While I don't often get down to this part of the country, I will always have fond memories of this little ""cafe"" called, Sam's."
5,"Perfect place to hang out while you wait to eat some of the best pizza around.  This spot has a nice IPA on tap and a decent wine list for my lady to choose from. Overall a night out at the Bianco spots is an evening you wont forget, unless you drink too much. haha"
5,"Seriously, I love this place! I wish I could give them ten stars! I've got three corgis and after a co-worker referred me here in 2009, I'll never go anywhere else. Every vet my dogs have seen is wonderful...between the three pups I've met with three of the doctors. They're all sincere, empathetic, thorough, understanding, engaging, respectful, and love to share their knowledge. Dr. Haroldson is a sweetheart and can probably put any nervous pet-parent at ease. Dr. Erickson is calm and laid-back, and I can talk to him about even the most awkward pet problems. Dr. Schweitzer is lively--a total hoot. Anyone who likes The Walking Dead AND Downton Abbey is alright in my book!

All Pets has been able to see me with very short notice, has never rushed me in and out the door, and always made me feel like my dogs were their top priority, even on busier days. They communicate clearly about diagnostic and treatment options. Their prices are very reasonable, and they try less expensive solutions first, instead of immediately recommending the most costly. Not that I'm cheap, it's just that having three dogs adds up. When they weren't 100% positive about something, they aren't afraid to ask each other for second opinions, which I appreciated when my dog Harry swallowed a corncob and had to have emergency surgery.

That's another thing I love about this place, is that they remember all my dogs names when I walk in the door. Not only the vets, but the front desk staff. Maybe it's my fiction-writer's imagination, but they really make me feel like a VIP. Kenna is always so excited to greet my pups and I love hearing about hers. Dana has a killer sense of humor and if you're lucky, she'll grace you with one of her zingers. Having three rambunctious corgis that get into trouble (catching rabbits and getting worms, swallowing corncobs and needing surgery, attacking car windows and breaking teeth, spraining toes from too much running) means I get to visit more often, and I honestly do not mind at all."
5,Toby's has the best fish fry in the Madison area without a doubt. We visited Toby's for the first time last Friday and were instantly impressed with the friendly service at the bar while we waited for our food. I had read about Key Lime Martinis being their specialty drink so I ordered one and it was delicious! Another one quickly followed the first it was so tasty. The fish was great. I ordered the cod and my Dad tried the baby pike and the perch. All three were excellent. I think the baby pike was my favorite. I never expected to have impressive french fries along with the fish but we couldn't believe how amazing the fries tasted. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The hash browns were perfectly browned. Loved the relish tray and the bread basket. We had a friendly server who urged us to try some of the breaded shrimp and that too was just another deliciousness to add to this meal. We left the place knowing we would be back.
1,"Sometimes I think that people are willing to let ANYTHING slide in order to avoid chain restaurants. That is why Fate is so successful.

Fate has the rudest staff and worst ""wait"" policy of any restaurant in town. The worst part? They make no apology for making you wait OUTSIDE for a table in 110 degree weather. Are they on crack? Outside??? The whole bar is empty...yet patrons are relegated to the hot dirty front yard. Why do you make people wait outside when you are empty?

One time I went there and only TWO tables were occupied. They told us there would be a 20 - 30 minute wait. I asked why there is a wait as nearly ALL the tables were open. The dumb girl at the door kind of shrugged and said they weren't enough waiters. So there aren't enough waiters to handle THREE tables instead of two???

At least let us wait INSIDE. 

Despite the place being empty the mean lady told us to wait outside. I said NO THANKS. and stormed off NEVER to return. 

FATE IS MY WORST DINING EXPERIENCE IN ARIZONA SO FAR.

Fate is less than 1 mile from my house, so it saddens me it isn't a place I can call home."
5,"My boyfriend and I discuss food often and he talked about his place with reverence always.  Well OMG.. it REALLY is special.  A simple chicken poboy made right..  Dipping it into certain soups of the day (curry chicken and creole cheeseburger were my favorites).  We call them dipping sauces (lol) and have even gone so far as to plan a trip to Madison based on the soups that day.  And their etouffe labelled ""too hot to eat"" actually lives up to its name while still retaining seriously good flavor is another rare find indeed."
5,Awesome donuts! They remember you after a couple of times and make you feel like an appreciated regular. This place will always be my standard for donuts.
5,"I've been taking the kids (cats) here for quite a few years after all of my friends raved about Sandhill. Dr. Nothnagel and everyone who works here are friendly, kind, and knowledgeable. My oldest cat Nihil received such great care before he went off to college - I just can't say enough about how wonderful everyone is here."
1,"Worst customer service ever! 
We entered Fridays one hour before the D-Backs game. We went into the bar and found two open bar tables. Before sitting down we asked a waiter if the table was available. He said yes, and we sat down. No one came to take our order for 10 minutes so we went to the bar and ordered drinks. A waiter came by after we received our drinks and gave us menus. Another waiter came by with more menus. After we had been at the table for 20 minutes, a hostess came over to say the table was reserved for the wait list and we had to move - the other table that was open when we came in was still open and there were at least eight tables open in the dining area. We told the hostess that a waiter told us we could sit there and she said it didn't matter. We asked for the manager. He reiterated that we had been told by a waiter that we could sit there, he didn't care. We asked if we could finish our drinks, since the other bar table was still vacant. He said no. We had to finish our drinks standing to the side of the bar (since you can't take them into the stadium). The table we were evicted from was never cleared or seated and when we left there was no wait list for seating."
1,"Let me start of by saying I LOVE food, great service, I like to share the enormous portions served in restaurants, drink water with lemon and I do not drink alcoholic beverages.  I know, I scream cheapskate, but I think I deserve a decent 2.5 star experience, at least for the food.  Most places meet or exceed my expectations.  Guiseppes did not. 

And there comes a time when my youthful, ethnic appearance, water with lemon, request to share, and sober living is met with that ""I am not going to make money off of you"" vibe from the owner.  It hasn't happened in a very long time, but Guiseppes proved their still is bad service reserved for their unwanted patrons.

I was very excited to eat here seeing it on Diners Driveins and Dives on Food Network, my favorite food network show, and seeing all of the New Times best of awards.  Got there at 8:30pm Friday night, there were people waiting outside, thought it was a good sign.  Now I thought being in a strip mall, next to the water N ice store, the service would be warm and welcoming and the place would be chock full of non-dbags.  I am always cool waiting a bit for good food but being stared down by rich, overweight women with their husbands in flip flops, cargo shorts and Affliction tees and teenage platinum blondes with their smug smiling boyfriends in their flip flops, plaid shorts, and Affliction tees is never my cup of tea.

Fast forward 30 minutes of this ish we get seated, another 10 minutes menus, another 10 minutes a water and a watered down gross iced tea which they CHARGED us for even though she took it back and gave him water, and by 9:30pm we get our 15dollar saltysaltysalty bolognese ragu with overcooked spaghetti (we didn't get the homemade pasta) to share, 4dollar baby 1/2 inch thin toastettes, and 2dollar marinara bowl for dipping.   (FYI this is an Italian Restaurant that not only makes you pay for an ounce of bread, they also CHARGE for extra virgin olive oil)

So go to Guiseppes if you like:

_""EH"" Italian Food
_Cold and dry humor from the owner
_Slow waitresses
_Being stared at by stuffy people in such an unlikely, un-stuffy atmosphere
_Your hopes let down =) Enjoy!"
1,"Ok, first of all, when I got there this morning to pick up my lunch,  the guy behind the counter was hitting on the gal in front of me so hard.  He spent all of his time and smiles on her that by the time he got to my order, he had not an ounce of friendliness left.  He acted like he was doing me a favor, begrudgingly.  That in itself is nothing, I have lowered my expectations of customer service since this new generation of pimple popping orgy addicts got their work permits a few years ago.  However, when I got the foot-long turkey sammi back to my office, the half I chose for breakfast had a little good morning suprise. (I just threw up in my mouth a bit.)
They should change their slogan from ""Eat Freash!"" to ""Eat Some Complete Stranger's Hair, Then Gag and Lose Your Appetite Completely"".  I'll bet that is the real reason Jared lost all that weight.  
Not happy Subway.  There is  a lovely Quiznos on Central and Camelback... They will serve my periodic sub sandwhich needs from now on.
AND DON""T CALL ME MAAM YOU IDIOT!  And get your teeth cleaned! That yucky yellow stuff is called tartar and it can be removed."
5,Great place to have breakfast at anytime the food is amazing and the service is great! Our server April was on top of everything made our Sunday brunch an experience :) thank you!
5,"I love this place, I really do! No rail so front row is right on the stage. The ambiance here is great and there's some cool bars and restaurants to hang at before the show. Waiting for a reason to come back. (Umphrey's!)"
5,"Quick service, great food at a very reasonable price. Great place for a lunch break from work. Also have a nice patio to eat on."
5,"I love this place.  The food is always fresh, they keep an eye on the buffet so they can refill the trays quickly.  I've never had anything here that wasn't great."
5,Strawberry glaze donut... oh how I hate you so much cause you are so irresistible. The donut is light as air and is just the perfect amount of sweet. It's a sin to be so tasty. Rainbow Donut's you are worth the extra mile on the treadmill!
5,"I'm half Japanese and have had a very difficult time finding good authentic Japanese food in the Phoenix area.  I am so impressed with this little restaurant!  The customer service is awesome.  The owner walked around talking to people and refilling drinks, getting to go boxes, and generally made sure everyone had everything they needed.  Top that off with some majorly delicious Japanese food, and that's The Blue Fin.  I had the Katsu Pork and I have to tell ya, it's just like my mother's.  Their food is made fresh and their sushi is made daily.  It's made the old fashioned Japanese way, not like the kind you get at Fry's Grocery Store.  Their prices are also very reasonable.  I can't wait to go back for the third time to try some other dishes.  Hmmm...maybe the yakisoba..."
5,I absolutely love this salon! I just moved to the area and my friend referred me here. I have very long hair and am super picky about my stylist and how my hair is cut. I made an appointment with Amy and from start to finish it was a wonderful experience. When I walked in the door I was greeted and asked if id like a beverage. I only had to wait a minute or two before being seen. I was given a great head massage while getting my shampoo and was asked again if id like something to drink while i waited under the dryer. Amy knew just how to cut my hair and even gave me some easy styling tips. I will definitely be referring this place and coming again!
1,"One star is far more than they deserve.  The owner of the property spent an excessive amount of time barking out reminders of hotel policy, was rude to guests and his staff.  The stay here felt more like being in prison with the warden constantly in your face.  People in the group that stayed were locked out of the room by management, forced to pay made up fines.  The owner ruined the entire experience.  If this is how customers are treated, this place won't be around long."
5,"It takes a lot to keep the well-oiled machine that is Horse Dog (aka my pet great dane) running smoothly. Horse Dog goes though dog beds about every month or so, and he requires state-of-the-art industrial toys, as he can destroy anything (including tires, couch cushions or shoes) in a matter of seconds. 

Just when I thought that Horse Dog was also going to consume my wallet as a result of his high-priced needs, I drove by Ryan's Pet Supplies and decided to stop in. Wholesale? Pet Supplies? In a world of overpriced PETCOs and PetSmarts, this place is now my savior.

Since their warehouse is Home Depot sized, things were a little bit hard to find at first. I was overwhelmed by aisle after aisle of boxes stacked on shelves towering to the celling. Luckily the staff members here are incredibly helpful, knowledgeable and accessible. They were more than happy to guide me through the store, answer my questions and open / search through box after box until I found exactly what I wanted. 

Ultimately I decided to purchase a massive human femur sized dog bone for only $9, and a giant industrial rope knot for a mere $8. My jaw dropped when the casher rang me up for a whopping grand total of $17. I would have spent well over $50 had I purchased these two items elsewhere.  

And it gets even better. Ryan's also has a catalog, so I can call ahead and phone in my order. It's like take-out for dog supplies. Plus if they don't have what your looking for, they can get it for you within a weeks time so you don't have to waste a trip there. 

Also, as a note to the ladies (or men too if you've got your murse in tow), they don't allow purses or bags of any kind into the warehouse. I didn't know this the first time I walked in, so they flagged me down upon my entrance. They lock your purses up in little cages, or they say you can leave it in your car...but um hello...have you seen that area?! So it's perfectly safe under the watchful eye of the cashiers. And if you seriously think that these employees are going to steal something from your purse, that they lock in a cage, in area equipped with video cameras, then you are overly paranoid.   

Ryan's is the king of pet stores, and I'm one happy dog owner because of it."
5,"My daughter's Quinceañera+/Sweet 16 Formal was held here at Lake Windsor Golf and Country Club on Sunday, April 10th, 2011.  I scouted a few locations, with a few places never getting back to me.  We've a large amount of family and friends for this traditional celebration so I needed a place that was both Big (enough for 300+ guests), Bold (that WOW factor when they even entered the building, foyer and ballroom) and Beautiful (for a place that would accentuate my daughter and her Epic Ballgown.)

I sent an email to Lake Windsor with no response.  Two weeks later I called, turns out my email was never received. See?  It pays to follow-up!  My contact from then on was with Ms. Jennifer Larson, the general manager to Lake Windsor Golf and Country Club.  

I need you to understand that this traditional event was very important.  I have been thinking about my daughters 'Coming of Age' party since she was five (5) and I went into the planning stages of this event early in 2009.  Jennifer and I spoke by phone and we met up the following afternoon. She was very informative, knowledgeable, and welcoming. No one had had such an event there at Windsor so she was very excited about this one!  We read and reviewed the contract, gave her a non-refundable deposit check and we were in the booking book!

My daughter Dylilah and I reviewed the menu and decided on a buffet style lunch and the vendors I worked with (Cake, Balloons Statues, Slide Show, Lion Dancers, etc.) had no issues having access to the property the day of.

If you'd like to see how great it turned out and how beautiful Windsor (and my daughter) really is, we've got the video here: http://youtu.be/DCX7KZQCzcE?t=2m8s

No, they are not inexpensive but, you get what you pay for and truly, I'm sure Lake Windsor will take your wishes and concerns seriously and execute them into an unforgettable time as they did with us!"
5,"I've been dining at Rosita's Place since the 80s.  It's probably my favorite Mexican restaurant overall.  Here's what I love:
Green corn tamales
Red sauce
Green sauce
Chili relleno
Wait staff (often the same waitresses who served in the 80s!)
Mariachis
Insanely large glass of iced tea
Atmosphere

I think Rosita's Place is the real deal.  It's not healthy food; it may not be particularly inventive food.  But it is done well, in a friendly environment."
5,"my wife and I went to see Sex and the Second City.  What a hilarious play!  We had a great time, everyone at the theater was very friendly and it was a great experience."
5,"As soon as the hostess saw us coming , she kindly opened the door for me & my wife! That was a great touch. 
Also, our server was very nice and friendly. Overall all the service we recieved was top class and really had a family feel to it. You can tell the staff is kept happy and thats important and good to see.

The food was great! Good sized salads and the tenderloin sliders appetizer is seriously the best thing ever! I love going to a bar and grabbing some filet sliders w/ garlic aioli and au jus sauce with a beer!

Everything was good. Water kept full. Clean bathrooms. 

Overall very happy we decided to eat there and will be back whenever we are in the state of AZ again.

1,"Really?! Who else finds it incredibly tacky that they added ""As seen on food network"" on their sign? 

Me thinks that a visit from Guy has made your head big. I enjoyed the food here before Guy visited. 

Now the service is rude, the prices are sky high and the food quality is down. I have given them the benefit of the doubt and eaten here a couple of times after the Guy visit. Every time it has gotten worse. I would much rather go to La Piazza Al Forno. 

The meatballs were small and tasteless, the sauce was very sweet. The lasagna used to be really good here but the last 3 times it has gotten smaller and costs more and the flavor is disappearing with the portion size. Overall to pricey for what you get. 

Again that sign is just plain old tacky and is enough of a reason to make me go elsewhere. In my opinion a stupid move. Maybe Gordon Ramsey should visit and give Giuseppe a much needed reality check!"
1,"Terrible at epic porportions.  A crime against BBQ.  As a Southerner, I wish to bring a class action suit aginst this place for claiming to ""put some South in your mouth"" on the sign out front.  The ribs were dry, flavorless and covered in some type of runny sauce that was essentially a watered down ketchup.  The Mac and Cheese side was basically Kraft from a box.  The cole slaw had a nice black pepper flavor and I actually liked that.  The place is a dive, service rude and the bathroom filthy.  To top it all off, I went here with a Yelp check in offer of $2 off if you spend $10.  well, the cashier had never heard of Yelp before and had to go talk to someone for quite some time (holding up the line) before granting the discount.  Then, the cash register only gave a $1 discount.  To make matters even more aggrevating, the recepit claimed I got the $2 Tuesday discount but clearly only took $1 off the bill.  So, in addition to being unable to serve good food or clean the establishment, they stink at math too.  
I've been in Phoenix only one day on a business trip, but surely there is at least some type of ""real"" BBQ in the town.  Guess I'll stick to Mexican food this trip.
Trust me...if you have even like BBQ a little bit, stay away from this place.  Your taste buds and self esteem will thank you."
5,This is an inexpensive way to eat out with the family. We got here often and mostly get good service. We use their Red Royalty card to save money. Often we end up getting an entree for free! It is clean and everyone can find something they like. Managers are responsive when there is an issue.
5,"I have had quite a few bad experiences in Phoenix as far as haircuts are concerned, but since I have been going to Jennifer @ Perry Monge I have never had a bad haircut. Jennifer is so friendly, so knowledgeable and makes sure that I leave happy, and I always feel taken care of. I tend to be picky but vague as to what I want (indecisive maybe!!) but she sees right through that and makes my hair look fabulous, her mens cuts really are a work of art!"
5,"One of the most wonderful places in the world. Great to go in the winter to feel some humidity and feel better, great for summer to see all the flowers. The gift shop is excellent for any (particularly female) gift occasion. Just a great place to go. Would be great for a date."
5,"Attended this school from 6th grade through senior year. I credit every success I have in the professional world to what I learned here. Presentation skills, group organization, personal prescence, and still having fun with arts on the side.... what more could you ask for? I would send my children here, my grandchildren here, everyone. It takes a certain sort of driven child to succeed here, so any of the regular ""coast through life"" types need not apply. Work hard, Play hard, Succeed."

autozone has recently changed their battery testing policy and equipment.

My battery passed the autozone battery test 3 times(after my car died twice), but failed my mechanics carbon pile load test. autozone will not honor the warranty unless the battery fails the less reliable autozone test.

buy your batteries and other carr stuff somewhere else."
5,"Just tried this place out for the first time and boy was I impressed!

I was on my way to the airport, running late of course... So I had the minimum amount of time to create the maximum amount of impact.  

The mission: to clean my ""hiking out in the desert with three dogs kind of dirty"" Subaru so that my parents from out-of-town could enjoy driving around for the next week.

Los Olivios got five guys working on it for me and totally rocked it out!!  I am crazy impressed and will definitely be back... Highly recommend!

TIP: check in on yelp for two dollars off a hand wash"
5,"Huge selection of great tasting food, have tried pretty much every except the shrimp tacos and it is all great. All food is made fast and fresh by friendly people. If you haven't tried it and would like something better than Taco Bell then it is a must."
5,"Great park, great atmosphere.  The last game we went to was a group sponsored picnic, again, great food, great atmosphere.  They did a nice job remodeling the park.  All the staff was very helpful.  Prices for the food are good, selection of stuff to eat is outstanding for a ballpark.  Highly recommend....  

To the lady below who signed up for the Mallard ""gnome"", it was a great promotion, and it looks great.  Nowhere on the face of this earth would someone do a promotion and let you in to get it without a ticket.  Get over it.  To give a low grade because you would not buy a ticket is beyond my pay grade..."
5,"This is my new favorite joint.

It is becoming quite the neighborhood favorite and I think it's because they just do it right. The setting is so...welcoming. With the lawn chairs and variety of mostly outdoor seating this is the perfect spot for a beautiful day or night. The staff is a bunch of characters who are very genuine and helpful. The food has clever names like ""Holy Puerco and Captain Fantasy"") oh and it is freaking amazing. Even the menu's artwork looks awesome (done by a local artist/cartoonist.)

I've been here three weekends in a row. The first time I had the Captain Fantasy which was endlessly delicious. Barbecued chicken on a fresh homemade biscuit with bacon, cheese and greens. I also had fries, wow a lot of food! The other two times I've had the Sunrise Sandwich with sausage and an egg over easy. It is also placed between a tasty biscuit along with some arugula. Yum! My boyfriend has had the welcome breakfast with chorizo and the Little Birdy. I had bites! I also tried their fried avocado, genius.

They serve drinks. Apparently on Tuesdays they have Hurricane Tuesdays, $5 for their famous hurricanes. I've also heard their Bloody Mary's are brilliant.

Well done Welcome Diner well done. See you all next weekend!"
1,Horrendously managed. Terrible service. Very rude and the managers seem to treat their employees with no respect. The drinks a watery and the tap selection is average. Food is ok but not worth a trip over to this joint. I don't recommend.
5,"You want to know about the history of Arizona?  You want to go to the Heard.

THE premiere anthropological museum on THIS Planet.

And, the gift shop:  Authentic stuff at hon estly reasonable prices -- that does not necessarily mean cheap:  It means *reasonable* for the authentic quality."
1,"I so badly want a Chicago style Italian beef joint near my house - and though I live just a few blocks away  - Luke's of Chicago is not it. 

I've been here twice - each time brimming with optimism at the hope of getting an approximation of the real deal.  Both times I was treated to hard, stale bread, bland meat, flavorless jus, burnt greasy fries.

I am sure my craving will return at some point - and because LOC is the closest thing in the area, I am sure I will be tempted.  I am leaving this review to remind myself to not waste my time."
1,Did not care for the food at
1,"The first time that I went into this place I thought that it was okay. I did not feel like it lived up to the rave reviews but it was good enough to bring me back to enjoy some food and drink with an old friend.  That time I had ordered their shrimp cocktail while I waited for my friend to arrive, I was starving! As I was eating, the owner (I assume) came up to introduce himself and asked if I live in the area (most of the patrons do)...as I turned back towards the bar to eat my very last jumbo shrimp, the Katie Perry look alike grabbed my food and dumped it in the trash! She never even asked if I was finished. I asked her if she decided that I was done eating and then she asked if I wanted another shrimp from the kitchen but I felt awkward at that point and told her no. She still brought me one lonely shrimp on a huge plate with no cocktail sauce. The sauce is what makes the shrimp cocktail. My friend and I then ordered their spinach dip.  The dip was brought out and as the plate was lowered to the bar, my chips were sliding off onto the bar and she just scooped them back on to the plate. I personally was not thrilled about that. I scooped some spinach up on to my dirty chip, blew on it a little and took a bite. This dip was the hottest (heat wise) thing that I have ever had in my mouth. I would compare it to biting the rack in a broiler.  I was never warned that they heat their dip up so hot. I guarantee the work of a microwave! I burned myself so bad that my mouth was peeling and bleeding. It took over a week of peroxide rinses, colloidal silver rinses and salt water rinses to heal my mouth. My mouth is actually scarred inside! This burned me so terribly that my teeth were sore, my jaw hurt and even my sinuses on that side of my mouth hurt. When I stopped in to tell the brunette bartender about my burn and I advised that they should warn people about how hot they make it, she replied with ""Well, don't scarf your food down, let it cool first."" Totally rude, offensive and bad customer service with a reply like that. That same night that I burned my mouth, my friend was using their hot sauce to spice up her chip and the bartender came over and started twisting the lid back on without asking if she was done and my friend had to stop her from taking it away. She clearly has issues with letting people finish their meal. When it came to the bill she had to ask us how many drinks we had because she wasn't keeping track... It seriously was not a lot of drinks to keep track of either. I think this place would be OK if it wasn't for this bartender. I did order a salad on a separate occasion (when I warned her about the hot dip) and that proved to be disappointing as well, way too much dressing and she kept giving me a hard time for not drinking during my work hour. Booooooo!!!"
5,"It was our first time visiting Monty's Blue Plate Diner and we will be going back our next time in Madison!

Fun atmosphere, great food, nice variety on the menu and not overwhelming, excellent service, AWESOME desserts, great prices...we only wish there was another one close to where we live :)"
5,"Ryan's is awesome! This is a large warehouse that is located in Phoenix for their catalog sales. Keeping that in mind, it is set up for their employees to pull product, not for customers. However, I always make sure I have plenty of time to walk the isles, finding all sorts of fun stuff for my pets. The staff is friendly and will readily help you find what you are searching for. The prices make the small inconveniences totally worth the trip!
helpful hints:
*all bags and purses must remain outside the warehouse. Staff will secure your bags for you.
*there is a minimum $25 purchase.
*there is no heating or cooling in the warehouse, so plan accordingly.
*a map of the warehouse and a catalog is available.
*catalog sales are their priority, so be patient if the phones get busy during checkout.
If you keep these few notes in mind, Ryan's is by far the best place to purchase pet supplies."
5,"Quiet, clean, super-friendly staff, and a nicely stocked complimentary breakfast. We will be staying here again when in Phoenix!"
1,"Uhh should have listened to yelpers! My roommate said this place was good so I went this morning and now, I'm regretting it. My car is still dirty but now I have messed up tint on my back window! I have no idea how they managed to mess up factory tint but now every time I look out my review mirror it's a reminder of how terrible this place is. When I brought this to there attention a guy with gold teeth pretended like he all of a sudden didn't speak english! I didn't have the time to try and speak with anyone else but, if I ever go back it will be to complain. The car is dirty and I'm sad. Don't do it!"
5,"Great place in Madison to find top notch wines and cigars.  The cigar humidor is huge with a fantastic selection.  And when you find the one you want, sit down, light it up and enjoy!  About the only place in Madison you can do that at.  They also have some really nice tasting events where you can try out a variety of wine, scotch and cigars."
1,"With 4 stars on yep I was hoping for a tasty breakfast but after a long wait I got a plate of overcooked eggs, weird tasting greasy bacon, completely undercooked potatoes (how hard is it to cook taters until they are brown?) and the toast they served tasted just like the greasy grill, terrible. It was all really inedible as was the Menudo that my girlfriend ordered. Disgusting. Also people are in there at 10am drinking large beers, very weird place. Is it a restaurant, store, bar? Not sure.. I am sure it sucks though and I will never go back."
5,"Literally the nicest, most sincere, excited employees I have seen working at a fast-food establishment. Never had a problem with the food or drinks. The rest of it is an average Taco Bell, but every single time I go, even through the drive-thru for a quick drink, the employees are the nicest people ever."
5,"Karim's knows their cobbler and they make an incredible one. The peach cobbler is warm, buttery, creamy and sugary sweet with each bite. If you've been bitten by the sugar elves and have a sweet tooth like me, then you must visit Karim's for a cobbler."
5,"Tickets to Phoenix Suns games are cheaper than the large beer in a cup at the arena. $10 tickets and $10.50 brews. I used to watch this arena on TV for years when the Suns were good and I was living elsewhere. It seems less orange in person, maybe some of the seats should be painted orange too. If you know the area, you will know not too pay for parking either. After 5pm, meters are free and obviously on the Sunday I went no charge. Try parking at 5th and monroe street. Inside the arena is pretty nice, I had a great view from the upper deck, but cmon Suns, do you really need ushers kicking people out of upper level seats. Give somebody a tiny bit of power and see what they do with it. Of course, I'm stealthy and uncatchable, so no senior citizen usher is telling me where to sit. Anyway, my team, the Brooklyn Nets won and overall a good, no hassle experience. If the Suns ever get good again, it will be worse to attend. Oh yeah, good entertainment also at least on this day. It was the gorilla's birthday and a ton of mascots were there celebrating and also the trampoline dunkers were cool and the 8 year-old girl who sang the anthem was top notch."
1,"Not good ,, too small... n its overrated! who waits 1hr for a glass of wine., i would rather get a bottle n drink at home."
5,I had Death By Chocolate.  Now I am dead and loving it.
5,I love their NOODLES! Try the Shanghai Noodles with vegetables (order it dry).
1,"This place sucks.  I didn't even go to the concert I had purchased tickets for - because I had really just wanted to see the opening act.  

Unfortunately for me, the opening acts changed and I was never notified- even though I had purchased the tickets via the website and they had my email address.  The night of the concert I realized the band I wanted to see wasn't playing and basically- the people at the box office told me ""tough shit"".  I talked to someone on the phone, and after the woman I spoke to treated me like crap, I went to the venue and another woman at the will call window treated me like crap too.

They both cut me off, told me too bad and recited something like ""you bought the tickets for the headliner, not the opening act"".  Which very well may be true, but their attitude sucked.  It sucked so bad, I would NEVER GO BACK.  Not even if Madonna played there and it was her last concert ever.

And I love Madonna.  Luckily for me, I contacted the band I wanted to see on myspace, and the band Manager emailed me back right away letting me know they would put me on the guest list for any concert I wanted to see them at."
5,"Would recommend this hotel. Beds are comfy, rooms are nice and clean, staff is very accommodating and goes above & beyond what's expected. We loved Tomeka at the front desk :)"
5,"I was here for the second meet up of the International Supper Club UYE. I thought that the first meet up was going to be hard to beat because it was so good but this place knocked another one out of the park. I think I just found my new favorite Mexican food place in town.
From the outside it looks like a hodge podge of different additions obviously added at different times with no thought at trying to make it match at all. Even the parking lot was a little crazy. Walking in the two front doors continues the hodge podge theme. This is a family owned restaurant that has been here awhile for sure. We sat in the front waiting area for the rest of the group to show up and I had to use the bathroom really quick. Those were also scary. Questions started to arise about this place. I hope the food is good. We waited a little while longer and they decided to seat us even though our whole party wasn't there. Then we walk in to the main dinning are. Now obviously at some point they gutted the entire inside and completely remodeled it. It was very nice. It was a large open space with an exposed ceiling and lots of tables. We were taken to a back section where several tables had been pushed together for us. Maria our server came over and chips and salsa were on the table immediately. She did a great job the entire night. Best services I have had in awhile. She took everyone's drink orders and drinks started to come out a few at a time. Once everyone was there and ready to order she went around the table and took everyone's order. Offering suggestions and helping with custom orders.
After what seemed like only a few minutes. Dishes started to come out as well. One or two here then a few more over there. Finally everybody had what they ordered and it all looked and smelled really good.
Then fork went to mouth and somewhere a chorus started singing. Wow this was really good. I had ordered a Carne Asada steak with a cheese enchilada. I couldn't pronounce what it was called when I ordered it and I won't even attempt it here. It really was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. The steak had a great flavor to it and with all of the cheese and sauce and everything it just added to it. I couldn't even finish. Although there wasn't too much left.
Even after that I still had to try some dessert especially after I saw churros and ice cream on the menu. This was not a mistake. It was so good. The ice cream was fantastic and the churros were warm and soft.
Everything was amazing. Maria was a great server. The company was fantastic as usual. Maria even split the check up for us even though there was a handwritten sign up front that said they didn't do that.
I hope to have many return visits here. My new favorite Mexican place hands down."
1,This KFC never has the chicken you want ready.  The staff and customers are awful.  The dining room is often hazy with smoke flowing out of the kitchen.  I go here only because it's close to work and sometimes I really want a side or sandwich which they usually have.
5,"Best way to pass the time for the infamous wait for Pizzeria Bianco. I had a great time with a friend here. 

It's a cozy place with a historical feel. Take a look in the drawers to find the visitors log and write something... even read some of what's been written. 

If you're going to be waiting for pizza... spend your time here. Have a great conversation, enjoy local brews, you won't regret it. 

Don't give this place impossible expectations ( you self proclaimed ""foodies"" are killing all the fun!)... enjoy this place."
1,"Visiting from California, absolutely loved it. The one thing that absolutely killed my entire family's experience and the day of my family was the guy named Alan at picture kiosk toward the entrance. Definitely beware of his callous crabby attitude ruining a family day out. He treated us as if we didn't have feelings and ignored a lot of our questions. You'd think the customer was always right.... Nope. It's Alan's world."
5,"Alice Cooper's Town is a mix of good food and rock 'n' roll, and has a fab bar.  Being one of the world's biggest Alice Cooper fans, I also loaded up on Alice stuff at the merchandise area before leaving.  The walls are covered with Alice memorabilia, which is cool.  True Alice fans will also note items on the menu named for his kids.  

Location is convenient to the arena where the Phoenix Suns play, and I believe may be within walking distance to the Arizona D-backs' ballpark.  Seating is good, and I agree with another reviewer that the make-up is a bit cheesy (especially since they only do the bottom half!) but it adds to the atmosphere.  The locals say you can even catch a glimpse of Alice here when he's not on tour."
5,"Back to Blue Fin for the nth visit, but the first visit for 2011!  Same great service, same good food, and same affordable prices.  

Had my usual order:

Terriyaki bowl - YUM
Fried Gyoza - HUM
Green Ice Tea - AHH"
5,"Darlene is awesome. I had to have my bridesmaid dress taken in in the bust and had to have it done in under a week. Darlene did an awesome job on the alteration and had it done in six days. I paid $45, which seems totally reasonable to me. I'll definitely go back to Darlene for my other alterations and repairs."
1,"The owner of this location is a real jerk.  I stood in line for 15 minutes and then when I finally got service at the counter- the old man finally told me that his credit card machines were down.  He then proceeded to get upset with ME because I didn't have cash on hand.  His exact words were ""You don't have any cash on you?!?!""  Ummmm, nooo, it's 2012 - I figured Schlotzsky's was modern enough to accept credit/debit.  I have no problem with technical difficulties and machines being down, but you should let your customers know instead of having them waste their lunch hour in line and then snapping at them for not carrying cash.

I also asked him how I could go about getting a large drink with my combo meal and his response was "" Pay for it.""  Hilarious."
5,"My kids and I love this place! The chicken biscuits are out of this world. So far I have tried the Captain Fantasy (talk about a kick) and the Bumble Bee (made with locally sourced honey) both have been fantastic. I have also had the Carol which is Kilt Lifter braised pulled pork on a biscuit, smoked in the back of course. 

The service has always been really friendly. The atmosphere is really laid back.  You will want to eat outside, as the inside is really small.  Pretty much the opposite of the Tardis (a little geek joke, nod if you get it).

My Step son recently got one of their burgers, and he said it was one of the best burgers he has ever had.  Definitely on my list to try soon.

All in all, its a place you have to try. You will not be disappointed in any way. oh did I mention that they are locally owned and locally sourced? So not only can you get good food, but feel good about it to."
5,"I wasn't completely sure what to expect when I went to the Heard Museum, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed myself.  We were there for almost 2.5 hours and the time flew by.  The permanent exhibit was laid out nicely and I truly learned quite a bit that I did not know previously about Native Americans.  In fact, I had no clue how many different tribes call Arizona and New Mexico home and reading the history and how they are now was quite fascinating, but I am a history nerd. The Remix contemporary exhibt was well-done and was my favorite portion of the whole museum, but I'm a sucker for contemporary art and installations.  We even wondered about the ""children's area"" and that was also well done with a variety of hands on crafts and activities for little peanuts (heck, my husband and I even did some of them! hehe).   The boarding school exhibit on the second floor was very nicely done and well laid out...the testimonials that played while you walked around were quite touching and at times I felt myself tearing up.

Adult admission is $10 and students are only $5. My husband forgot his ASU student ID and when he mentioned it to the cashier, the guy was like, ""oh that's OK"" and gave us the student admission anyway. Very nice.  There were quite a few people at Heard while we were there, but I never felt rushed or that I was in someone's way, which I think speaks highly of the layout.  I definitely recommend the museum if you have an afternoon you are looking to fill and/or just want to learn more about Native Americans."
5,"Mallards are hot.  Definitely check it out.  I heard it was a drunk fest, but it seemed more like a family event to me.  Might depend on what day you go.

Good fun!"
5,"So...this is the kind of food that will kill you. So there's that. But that being said, this is the best way I can think of to take in food with absolutely no nutritional value. The ribs are sweet sticky tender meat bars. The sides are sweet sticky flavor bombs of flavor. The rolls are airy buttery balls of carbohydrates. You should get extra napkins.

I think this place is best for carryout. You can sit and eat - there are a handful of tables, but then there are also bullet holes in the windows. Since it's Madison, I'm assuming someone put them there for show, but definitely with a real gun, so anyway I'd rather eat at home.

Also, if you've been doing the House of Cards thing and want that BBQ experience but you don't live in the south, this is the closest you are going to get. So, check it out Madison, it's a little bit different but that doesn't mean it isn't fabulous!"
1,"I went into get a replacement phone and received one....1.5 months later.  The first time I went to have my phone looked at I waited for more than an hour in line as employees milled about seemingly aimlessly.  When I was finally called up, they took my phone and told me to wait for another hour.  I walked around the mall for an hour and came back to find that they couldn't fix it...Fine 2 hours of my life burned but fine.  I was urged to upgrade in 10 days and I went home to think about it.  A week or two later I returned again and was told that they would put in an order for my replacement phone and that it would be shipped to me...14 days later I returned to ask where my phone was...The sales rep confirmed that the order was still just sitting on the technician's desk in the back room.  Wonderful.  At this point I call corporate and make a ruckus and the manager of the store calls me to assure me that the phone has been ordered, ""I will call you when it comes in.""  12 days later I call to ask where the phone is and they tell me it has been in for 10 days and assure me that they called me about it.  No.  Finally my replacement phone is received but after 30 mins fiddling with it, they tell me they can't transfer my contacts...Not from my old phone to a new variety of phone...from the same make and model to the same make and model.  I am beyond disgust."
5,"Metcalfe's is what all supermarkets should aspire to be.  I have never been to a supermarket that has its combination of size, local products and management.  It carries everything from value (Sentry Brands) to premium version of products.  

They also GIVE out free Sunday papers.  There is no low end of purchase to get this offer - I bought a pack of gum for under a dollar and they asked if I wanted a newspaper.  Righteous!

Every department runs extremely well.  I've never had a problem with rotten or outdated goods while shopping.  The staff are plentiful and friendly. Even at the busiest times, they staff cashiers smartly and the lines are rarely longer than three deep. 

During the late afternoon and early evening, you are bound to run into a vendor providing samples of their local product.  Unlike every other store I went to, it's often an owner or manager that handles the stand.  Frequently they even have WINE!  Delicious wine at that. 

Local foods and brands are center stage here.  They are clearly identified as local on their display.  You'll see local everywhere from the bakery, frozen foods and cheeses (of course).

The only critique is that the deli prepared foods and the bakery are good, but not great.  If I have a little more disposable income, I go down the road to Whole Foods to get my prepared deli/bakery fix.  With that written, I am very picky and their deli is much superior to Copps (read my review of the very sad S. Park Copps -- I really deserve Metcalfe's!) or other like grocers. 

Although Whole Foods has a short list of better prepared products (for example, their deli and bakery), they cost so much more (it's referred to as ""Whole Paycheck"" for a reason) and have nowhere near the variety and local selection Metcalfe's has.


Tips:  

1 - Be careful in the parking lot.  Their are many patrons that have lost their driving skill (think that South Park episode) and it may be frightening at times.  Drive very defensively and always given certain drivers the right of way.

2 - Like their Facebook page for insight on demos and events.  For example, last month they had a three-day cheese tasting event hosted by cheesemakers in town for the American Cheese Society Conference. 

3 - If you must use plastic bags, Metcalfe's has the best in the business - they are an awesome green (some sort of implied ""gentle"" dig, I know ... but whatever) and very sturdy.  I use those for my small wastepaper baskets - they look and hold up better than anything I paid Hefty for..."
5,Why did it take me nearly 2 years of living downtown to finally make it here?
5,Best Pizza Ever. You have to pick it up though. Its worth the drive. Thin crust cut in squares. Best freakin' sauce....mmmmm...........Buck's....mmmmm......
5,"Excellent Friday fish fry!  Their beer batter fish is crisp,tasty, and not at all greasy.  The hush puppies were equally good, but the fries could use some work. Our waiter had a great personality and not only provided good service, but interesting trivia such as the fact that our meal had been prepared by Steve Miller's son (of The Steve Miller Band fame).  
  Reasonable prices, nice-sized portions, good service, and really good food--we'll be back!"
1,"out of business on april 30, 2014."
1,"I came here and ordered the baja burger. It was DISGUSTING. Greasy, with wilted vegetables and absolutely dripping with excess juice. I could barely eat it, but I was so hungry that I just held my nose and forced down a few bites. The sweet potato chips weren't much better; too greasy and stale. My friend had a strawberry daiquiri, which I also tried. It was acceptable, but the taste was off. 

The service wasn't good either. Our waiter neglected us, and we did not feel at all taken care of. I will not be back."
1,Okay here it goes..while their food remains consistently delicious.. their service leaves a LOT to be desired. This issue is with the bartenders. A group of us showed  up for a birthday dinner. The regular wait was an hour.. for us (party of 11) was 1 1/2. My friend Carlos and I walked  up to the outside bar and no bartender to be found.. ok? No problem..inside we went. Okay so we approach the inside bar. We stand there and are unnoticed  by the 3 people behind the bar. Finally a woman greets us..imagine Janis Joplin and Joan Jett having a love child and now she's in her 40's..She takes my order a single Amstel Light...she takes Carlos' order.. 2 drinks. She cards us.. I show her my id and he shows his. She explains she needs to see and card the person he is buying the drink for. Okay that's a pain.. but fine. So what does she do. She leaves me at the bar while she goes with Carlos out to the crowded patio to card his wife.. really? How about you take care of me since I have met all the requirements? okay? so while she is gone..another bartender comes up and takes my order. As he is about to grab me a beer Janice Jett returns and says something to him he looks at me and I say the beer is for me Im on my own tab he turns back and he walks away?? WTF? What does it take to get a friggin' beer. So Janice Jett gives Carlos 2 drinks then I finally get mine and what does she do? She puts it all on Carlos' tab? Are you freakin kidding me? Janice Jett you are the WORST bartender ever. You did nothing right in this transaction. Needless to say we ended up with her as our server.. Murphy's Law..and she tried to card me again! I clued her in that she had done it just 20 minutes ago and her memory kicked in. Then we ask for more drinks. Half the table received theirs..and she made the rest of us wait as she doled out waters. Waters are great but we ordered beer..give us what we ordered! THEN give us waters..Ive never been so frustrated or irritated. It was almost laughable. Needless to say I didnt bother to order any more drinks after that.. what's the point..I wouldnt get it in a timely fashion anyway.
1,"Gucci store at the Scottsdale Fashion Square. I just wanted to inform those out there that last week on 6/24/13 I walked into the Gucci store a gentleman was standing by the door about 10:30 am to 11:00 am and I didn't get not one Hello, smile or acknowledgement what so ever. Gucci needs to go back to basics ""Customer Service"" goes a long way"
1,"The last time I dined here was many years ago. I recalled it being a ""decent"" dining experience then, but one I wasn't exactly enthusiastic about repeating again during a recent visit with friends. As another poster mentioned, there is a small segment of the population who is rabidly devoted to this long time Phoenix fixture. Why? I'm not exactly sure. My most recent experience, days ago, left me wondering how this place has managed to stay open for so long.

Upon entering the dark, cavernous entrance, no one was there to greet us. It took a while before someone noticed and seated us. The dining area on this very hot afternoon, was uncomfortably warm. Not exactly a respite from the heat.

Then the salsa and chips arrived. Please see the photos and other reviews on this awful concoction which appears to me to be nothing more than tomato sauce (spaghetti sauce base) with a few chili pepper seeds thrown in for good measure. This stuff absolutely comes from a can. If you ask for the ""other salsa"", what appears next is a watery, minced pepper mixture that is horribly bland and only slightly better than the tomato sauce salsa. I wound up eating the chips by themselves.

I ordered a chicken burro enchilada style. The rice was fine, the shredded chicken abundant, but not seasoned. The enchilada sauce topping was also quite flavorless. 

All in all, highly disappointing and completely non-authentic."
1,"DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU BLACK (:), All you will find here is minorities being racist to minorities;  Nick refused to cut my hair.   I went here because by the recommendation of another posted review.   If you cannot cut a regular (guard 1 )fade on a black guy you should not be cutting hair.  End of story and shame on the owners for allowing this.


In the alternative, I would recommend ""Nappy by Nature"" on Bethany Home Road or if you're at Baller status and you only want to make an appointment (because you like to jump right in the chair) I would go to ""the Art of Shaving"" at fashion square mall.  Barbers in both locations know how to cut all types of hair."
5,"Oh, Gaprao Gai, how I love thee.  Nom."
5,"This is my favorite Mexican Food restaurant. The guacamole is awesome. My husband likes the shredded beef tacos I love the green chile burros enchilada style with green sauce. I have tried many other things on the menu and they are all good! The salsa is great the people are friendly.
It is clean and I always know what we are getting."
5,"Best hair cut in town. Clean facility, friendly staff, and they are always very welcoming. Definately recommend getting your hair cut here...actually, I recommend getting them all cut - HA! (hair cut humor is just awful) If you are in to hair products, they have a great selection on Aveda stuff."
1,"Ehh.... Probably wont return.  Friendly workers, beautiful restaurant but... 
The food was NOT good at all..  
I dont know where to really start. I guess...
The waitress didnt get my order right. 

I ordered:
the burger with BBQ, Bacon, and onions, with seasoned fries and a side salad with croutons....  The salad came back without croutons, had to hunt the waitress down to get them..  The Fries came back without any seasoning. and the fries tasted just awful!  The Burger wasnt too bad.. Although, I think i would have rather have eaten a Bic Mac lol. 

My BF ordered:
The Hobo Skillet with side of pancakes... the skillet had a hair in it..  it was really greasy and not much flavor.. and whatever flavor it did have it wasnt the greatest..

The best the best items we had  were the pancakes, and the croutons.. 
I probably wont go back again...  :("
5,"Monty, thank you for saving my restaurant foody soul last night.
After a disastrous meal at another restaurant, I was crabby, mad, moody and wanting to go home.  Luckily we drove by the shining light of the Monty's sign and pulled in to the parking lot.  
Grabbed a seat at the counter and ordered a piece of pecan pie a la mode for myself and my husband.  Your hostess, waitress, bus staff were all polite, welcoming, and doing their jobs.  They refilled our coffee, checking on our food, did we need anything else?  THANK YOU!
The pie was delicious, the ice cream melted slowly into the pecan crust and became a delicious consoling comfort food. 
My congratulation on being a place that I have visited for over 10 years and still makes the mark of having great staff, great food and ambiance.  That turquoise counter has never felt so good to lean my elbows on as last night."
1,"I see so many posts recently, Coach and Willies was sold and turned in to Legends back in October 2012. Please know that when posting on this site. You should go to the Legends site to do so."
1,i went in to purchase stamps.  I was not told how much the service charge would be beforehand and didn't know until it was rung up.  I didn't look at the stamps until I got back to my office and found that all of the stamps were at the old rate of $.45.  Now I have to go to the post office and purchase $.01 stamps.  Hopefully they are informed and using the current rates for their other shipping services!
5,"IWalked in 40-30 mins. Before close . My husband helped my son find a hair cut in the books. The lady was friendly. And he left with a BIG SMILE! A woman with red hair came. In and was talking to the receptionist while I was waiting. Saw my artwork and told me next door they have a day spa next door! That her husband was an artist! I want to check this out!

I am ever so sad I didn't get my hair cut here! I went near my house, at Miguels on 16st/Roosevelt. They woman didn't listen and chopped off my hair!! I left crying.  When I get brave enough again, I amfor sure going to El y Ella!!"
5,"Wonderful place.

I am brand new to the (now less) intimidating world of bikes and cycling and broken pedals and flat tires, and these guys don't care. They treat me like I've been riding for years, yet never laugh at my questions or concerns. (And they didn't laugh when I leaned my bike against the wall and it came crashing to the ground. Or they waited until after I left to laugh, which is something I can appreciate.) I've purchased simple things (like water bottles) with them and trusted them to reassemble the bike and add pedals and air to the tires and a new saddle. All was handled professionally and quickly at, what I assume to be, a fair price. 

Stop in and say hello. Pet the two store cats (but keep in mind that one is deaf so your repeated Hi Kitty, Hi Kitty, Hi Kitty pleads will go unheard) and take a look around at what they've got. Revolution Cycles is a great neighborhood place."
1,"This is my first Yelp review and under better circumstances I wish I was writing my first great review. Unfortunately not. I'm usually like those of you who get too lazy to complain even if there's something wrong and usually there's not much that bothers you. However, this was my first car I bought with my hard-earned money and I wanted this to be a special event. I bought it last week but it was raining all last week so I waited and waited until today. So I scoured through my fellow Yelpers to help me pick a car wash that has great reviews. My eyes locked on World Class Car Wash and I spared no expense. I purchased the full detail $49 and Hand Wax $20. 

I told them that the previous owner had window stickers and decal everywhere. I told them about something he stuck on the dashboard and a residue that remained. I pointed them all out and I thought with paying $70 total for everything I would get some attention on things I specifically asked about. However, much to my dismay, the stickers and decal remained. I asked them to remove it and I thought it was good. Even up until then, I wanted to be happy so I just left. As I was driving my car I noticed gunk all over the window. The guy who was scraping with the razor to get the decals and stickers off didn't bother to throw decal residue out after scraping them. Everything remained. As I checked more later, I noticed candy wrappers from the previous owner still there but this time soaked breadcrumbs from being watered during the detailing process. It was nasty digging my hands down there to collect all the wrappers. 

I was very disappointed. This was my first car and I wanted it to be an experience. Sorry guys."
5,"My favorite car wash. A million times better than Danny's Fam Car Wash (which I hate, btw).  They don't try to sell me a new windshield that I don't need, they don't try to upsell on detailing or anything, I can inquire myself. They always do a great job, and I have a huge SUV that is a pain to clean. SUVs are a little more expensive to wash than cars (which I'm not disagreeing with, it makes sense -- just an FYI). You can also get a yearly pass that is a huge discount to the one-off washes. My entire family washes our cars here and will never go anywhere else."
1,"My friends and I like to hang out, buy cheap drinks and appetizers, and have fun. Applebees is typically our ideal location for nights we plan out, due to their awesome happy hour. We usually go to one particular location but on occasion we will go to this one (44st and Thomas). I've been to this location maybe 8 times. Every single time, we leave incredibly dissatisfied. The food is cold or tastes old. The drinks are always watered down.

The last time we went was a few weeks ago. My boyfriend had just got off work and wanted to have some drinks after a long day. We decided to go to Applebees, once again, for some food and drinks. Since this location was nearer, we decided to give it a shot.

I ordered the nachos. Because I'm a vegetarian, I ordered it without the chili cheese sauce. How hard is it to get nachos wrong? My boyfriend ordered the two for $11.99 meal and got the blackened steak and chicken parmesan pasta. To drink, I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and he ordered a Dos Equis beer. The drinks sat at the bar for ages as we waited for the waitress to deliver it. By the time we received them, they tasted watered down- even the beer. 

Finally our food arrived. The nachos looked great, as did his food. However, looks can be deceiving. Everything about the nachos was disgusting. The cheese (queso blanco sauce) was cold, as if the nachos had been sitting around. The chips tasted old and stale. My boyfriend's steak was tough and very small. And the chicken pasta was cold as well.

The waitress (I believe her name was Taylor), wasn't very attentive. I don't blame her for the quality of the food, but the service could have been better. When we asked for the check (after I could only manage to eat some of the nachos) my boyfriend decided to inform her about the old taste of the chips. The waitress informed us that we needed to tell her earlier, which was understandable. She went on to explain the old taste could have come from the fact that the fresh batch of chips were just currently being fried, so my batch was most likely older, which obviously did not sit well with me. 

We paid, and even tipped decently (15%), left quietly, and vowed to never ever go there again. We will drive out of our way to go to a different Applebees if need be."
1,I have gone to this Applebee's countless times and each time the food has been okay and the waiters have been mediocre. I liked the food that they have but for the past 3 times that I have gone. My food took ONE HOUR AND A HALF. That was unacceptable to me! They also didn't give a discount or even sorry for the inconvience. I remember seeing a commerical of how the food needs to be made in 30 minutes during happy hour or it all will be free. I guess that doesn't apply! Its probably another scam to bring customers in. I also didn't give the waitresses a tip each on of the times that the food was late. My friends and I were about to leave because the food took so long to come. I had ordered a simple spicy chicken salad and that took almost 2 hours to prepare. Other people's foods were being made before us when they had clearly come later then us. Probably not going to this place anymore more for late night food.
5,"Best Thai food you will ever eat! This IS my favorite Thai food restaurant! I have far too many items on the menu that taste AMAZING but don't miss dessert! My favorite dessert is the (homemade) coconut icecream with the fried bananas on the side. AMAZING! Simply amazing. It's my favorite dessert of ALL TIME!
I must add that I really love peanut butter chicken (a childhood favorite) and this restaurant gets it perfect every time!"
5,"Went for a tour of the brewery.

The tour guide was great, the brews were incredibly fresh and tasty, and we overall had the best experience of being a tourist in Madison, WI here.

The beer garden aspect is tempting for a possible future return, but we'll see. Look out for a potential future review, Yelpers!"
1,"This may be the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted... I was starving and couldn't even finish it.  I got the sampler so I tasted everything, nothing was good:( so sad because they were nice."
1,DO NOT EVER BUY a gift card from this restaurant.  We got seriously scammed on our gift card and management has done nothing about it.  They don't care that their customers are  being ripped off because they already got their money.  I had to file a complaint with the Attorney General's office against Richardson's/Rokerij.
5,"Brian's favorite place where we always came before the ASU football games. How can a dinner with eight women not be great !

Just another place missing Brian."
5,"Visiting from LA, looked for a place to eat late at night and found this place. Would recommend the Champion burger, pulled pork fries, sunrise biscuit, and beignets"
5,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  The Old Spaghetti Factory is my alltime favorite restaurant in the whole world, and has been since I was 3!  This is ALL because of their spaghetti with mizithra cheese....My mouth is watering right now just thinking about this dish.  With it's rediculously flavorful shredded goat and sheeps cheese (mizithra), and the warm brown butter and garlic sauce, this meal is decadent - but without the pricetag!  For $16 I can get this entree, with salad to start (their homemade ranch dressing is to die for), warm bread with garlic butter, dessert (spimoni or sherbert), AND a glass of wine.

The decor is also amazing - so unique and eclectic, it's got a really fun ambience - complete with dining trolley in the center of the room!  There are private rooms for even small dinner parties (I had a private room for a dinner of 4 once, and it was simply luck of the draw).  

The old arcade games (think pacman) in the lobby waiting room are entertaining as well.

Basically, if I were on death row, this would be my choice for a last meal.  I have no idea how anything else tastes here, because I always order the same thing, and I always leave completely, happily, satisfied."
1,"I ordered the teriyaki chicken, which is apparently their specialty, and priced accordingly.  It was $7 for a medium sized bowl and drink.  The chicken was mediocre and the rice was kinda gummy.  

Even still, this wouldn't have warranted the one star until I bit into a chunk of bone that they forgot to sift out.  Nasty."
5,Always have a great time here.. attentive staff. Good drinks and fun. Nothing else is necessary
5,"I think I need a cardiologist on call after my delicious and greasy meal indulgence at Welcome Diner.  The burger, fried chicken sandwich on a biscuit, fries with gravy on top and fries with bacon and cheese on top are all heavenly.  Fried avocado Po' boy was also divine.  Add a few hurricanes and I was a happy camper."
5,"Have any of you been to JCPenney recently? WOW! It's on the up!

First of all, the new pricing policy is great. Three tiers: 1) standard price, 2) month-long specials, 3)markdowns straight to ""best price"" - so if you see something with the red tag you know that it's the lowest it'll be. And, wow, they are going low. 

I got my little cousin 5 shirts, 1 skort, and a pair of jeans for $17 2 weeks ago for her birthday. Yes, kids clothes are cheaper than adult clothes in general, but this was just a steal.  Last night I found a pair of M-N-G (Mango) jeans for $5. FIVE DOLLARS! And they're doing a total remodel of the store and have already installed a really fashion-forward jeans department featuring Levi's products (which, sadly, have never worked for me - but it's still a well designed department) and a really wonderful, if a bit small, shoe department.

Fashion-wise, having lived in Europe for 3 years I can say with confidence that the M-N-G line that Mango is doing for Penney's is sometimes even better than the stuff in their standard stores in the UK and Europe (I kept noticing this on trips to the US). They've also got other designer collaborations and seem to be trying to compete with the fashion-forward nature of Target, etc. while keeping hold on the more traditional department store branding as well.

Since moving back to the US in the Spring, I've been shopping more at Penney's that I had in probably the 5 years before I left. This location and the West Towne location are really making great strides."
1,"After the hype about their burgers I was really looking forward to trying the food here. 

The meh: The hushpuppies were 1/2 way decent, but nothing extraordinary. Edible. No honey offered with them though.

The ugh: With the all of the acclaim their burgers get, you would think that they were doing something special here. They aren't. The burgers are frozen patties and look like they're right from Sysco. The reason that people are probably saying they're so good is because the patties aren't cooked within an inch of a briquette. Normally I would say that's a good thing, but when you're making me a burger from an unknown origin handled by who knows how many people....needless to say, medium rare frozen beef patty is doesn't = amazing burger in my book. 

I can't say that I would visit again. There are far too many amazing hamburgers on the west side made with real beef from local butchers to waste my time with this place.

UPDATE: I've spoken with a couple of people that are thinking it may be a fluke that I ended up with frozen patties the time I was there. Apparently they have a machine there that they make their patties with. I'm going to have to revisit in the near future to investigate."
5,Some of the best teriyaki chicken in phoenix.. Fast and always friendly! If only they were open weekends!!
1,STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!!! this place is an absolute joke. I came in today 10/29/2013 to have my I-9 notorized and let me tell you the asshole behind the counter is lucky I had my daughter with me. First off good job to John Willard Crawford for once again jackin shit up for all black people kudos asshole. Second he did not have to be completely rude to my wife if you know you job so well john then why didn't you do it and now I have to return to your God forsaken shit hole of a store with directions on how to do your job to fix it humm John why is that? I will tell you because you have no clue thats why and your arrogance is a hilarity at best and a travesty all around. Get your head out of your ass admit when your wrong or have not a clue and step down off you high horse. Oh and i payed in change cuz you were a dick sir a wothless flaced good for nothing but wasting my time dick. Oh and nice professionalism with the jersey and shorts good look for a man who is old enough to be my dad. Grow up do your job learn people skills and maybe you will get more stars so  to some it up SCREW THIS PLACE!!!!!
5,"I have taken many shoes, boots, a few purses, chaps, and leather coats, to have fixed and have always been very pleased with their work, service, and efficiency. I could take my items to a place closer to me, but it's worth driving a bit out of my way to know I'll be treated well."
1,"My girlfried had heard from a friend that this place was great and that was exactly like New York pizza.  This pizza is not like any NY pizza that I've ever had and if it were, then NY pizza would not have the good reputation that it does.  The food was awful.  I literally had to force a second piece down my throat even though I was starving.  
The service was great, but no amount of waitstaff attention can make up for the crap coming out of the kitchen.  There are so many better pizza restaurants around that there is no need to upset your stomach at this place."
5,"My mom and I have been faithful clients for over 10 years, and I don't think that will ever change! I am guilty of bringing too many pictures that try to show what I want in my next haircut, and they always go above and beyond and give me more than what I expected. I've had a pixie cut, asymmetrical bob, bangs, and highlights done, and I loved each and every change I made, thanks to them.

Their massages before they work on your hair are AMAZING. I tend to doze off, and by the time I have to get up to walk to the sinks, I miss it already! Their tea is refreshing, and the salon itself is really hip and modern. It's quintessential Downtown.

I always feel pampered when I go. They know what they're doing, and they're great at it. The price is definitely worth it, because unlike most salons, the work lasts and your hair leaves healthier than it did before."
1,"Two! Not one,  but two roaches crawling on the table. Came in, sat and ordered then here comes a Roach crawling on the table then another! Not sure if the solar flares, the full moon, or the fact that it's Friday the 13th had anything to do with it,  but the fact that it was my first time there, the roaches made it my last time there! And the fact that the booth seating with the huge square pillars makes for an uncomfortable setting. And the energy is not good,  very off! Also, the roaches were small, meaning there are more, probably a nest! Roaches don't come out during the day unless there's an infestation! Wouldn't recommend eating here!"
5,"I took a friend and tried this place after reading the reviews here on Yelp. The food here is great!   Started with great chips and salsa, the green tomatillo salsa was especially good. Tried the shrimp tacos and the tacos durados chicken. Both were excellent, They were served with beans, rice, and a small salad. There was plenty of food for both of use, my friend gave me one of her tacos as she could not finish her plate. They have various Mexican beers and Bud Light available and it was served very cold with a frosty glass and a lemon slice. They also have Mexican bottled sodas in real glass bottles. We left stuffed and very happy.  I will definitly be back!!"
1,"Not exactly an upscale mall by a long shot.  Service is horrendous and it is crowded and messy, with a poor selection of low grade stores."
1,"I really hate giving bad reviews, but the seafood was terrible here.  You could tell we were eating old shrimp. The salmon was also old and had a super strong, fish odor.  Cost was too expensive. We paid $50 for two dinners one pop and one margarita.  The salsa was just ok.  The only thing that was good was the margarita, but I went there for seafood. Very disappointing."
5,"Drove through Phoenix during our trip to Sedona and stopped by this place. Thankfully, there wasn't a Suns or Diamondbacks game as we quickly realized this restaurant was directly across US Airways arena.
Told the waitress we were from out-of-town and she told us about the history of the restaurant, including its affiliation with Alice Cooper and local legends such as Randy Johnson.
Speaking of Randy Johnson, I shared ""The Big Unit"", a 22-inch hot dog good enough for 2 adults. Only bad part is that it gave me food coma for the rest of the drive!"
1,"Very terrible service, waitress did not khow what she was doing. Did not state her name, walked by us twice with out asking if we needed anything. Someone else brought our food, we had to get up ourselves to get napkins. Someone by the name of Justin apologized, who was he? Then someone else came up by the name of Joey{who was he???} and said drinks are on us, unfortunately both burgers have been taken off for our Birthday's. Really un-proffesional. they could have put them back on our card's. The worst Birthday burger ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Yeah, thats right a five freakin star rating.  

Five Star Truck Stop Dining At Its Finest.

Be prepared to eat.  

I was first introduced to the Pine Cone at its Johnson Creek location years ago and freaked out at the size of the awesome, delicious desserts.   Then on a recent road trip someone mentioned about eating at the Pine Cone, I thought is there really more than one?  I looked out the window to see exactly where we were at and it wasn't near Johnson Creek -- when we arrived, and I saw the bakery....I knew I was home.

It was near dinner time so I ordered stuffed chicken breast.  The dinner roll alone is a meal.  I can't say enough about dinner.  Everything is homemade. They don't add alot of salt, if any.  You can tell its fresh.  Its plentiful.  Its cheap.  You literally can stuff yourself for next to nothing.

You can't possibly leave this place without indulging on some bakery goods to take home, IF they can make it home.  In our case, they were safely packed in the trunk for our safety and yours.  The last thing we need to explain to the police is we were under the influence of bakery goods from the Pine Cone."
5,"I don't have a VW, but I deliver pizza to this business from time to time. Sometimes money falls out of my pocket when I'm making change, and I guess that happened today. Dave called the pizza store and told us that the driver dropped some money! Thank you for being honest!"
1,The Worst Customer Service Experience in a long time.  Long wait times while giving off lots of attitude while you wait.  Amazed at the consistency of the poor attitude of every single employee in the place.  Do yourself a favor and stay away!
1,Seriously? Shut up. This place blows. Wouldn't last 4 minutes in NY. I'll bet the Vegas store doesn't last either.  This place insults the pizza.
1,The bar was okay but the comedy show was horrible.
5,"We've been coming here since January 2014 and have never been disappointed. I usually order the catfish po' boy, but alas it has been taken off the menu. No worries, it turns out that a new addition, the Tuna So Gouda, is also a winner. Not too mayonnaise-y, the flavors are capers, dijon mustard and basil. Served on rye, it's a big win.

The beer list isn't huge but it's got all the best of the bunch and changes often. The noise level can be challenging, given the small size of the place and the fact that it's usually packed. 

Love the interior, very art deco-ish in blues, greens and golds, warm and inviting. The service is friendly, attentive and prompt. The fried pickles are a must-have appetizer, they're slices rather than spears, and the batter is a light tempura style. They're served with the Tip Top sauce, a spicy sriracha aeoli. Delish. Had me wishing for another round :-)

They were surprisingly not busy last night probably due to the extensive road work currently happening right in front and all around the building. Now would be a great time to check them out if you haven't, it will be quieter and no waiting."
1,Been trying for 30 mins on and off to order a delivery. I get voice mail and nothing else.
5,This place is awesome.  So much fun for the kids!
1,"I would love to rate their food, but never got the opportunity.  Happened to stop there on a Saturday evening at about 5:45p and could not even get in the door because the hostess was blocking the area with a party of four.  Instead of taking the party aside so we could enter, and I should point out I was on crutches, she had us wait outside until she could seat them.  We entered AND STEPPED ASIDE so others could enter.  There were three in a our party.  When she asked if we had reservations, I replied no,  and she commented NO?  You KNOW IT IS SATURDAY.  I wanted to say yes, yesterday was Friday and tomorrow is Sunday.  Instead I replied that I was TERRIBLY sorry i did not realize i needed a reservation, and she once again reminded me it was SATURDAY.  I had never been there and did not realize that it was a quaint, small place.  Had I known, I would certainly made a reservation.  I probably will not make a reservation and try the menu since the hostess obviously thought I did not know what day it was.  Yes, it is probably my loss, but I don't enjoy being insulted."
5,"After a very bad experience at Stanton Optical, it was a breath of fresh air to be greeted by Susan at Wisconsin Vision. She helped me pick out my frames and helped me save 100$  on my frames at the register. It was very affordable and enjoyable. I will return there for my next pair."
5,"The search is over...I have found my favorite wine bar in the Valley! 

Comfortably situated on Central Avenue slightly south of McDowell, it's a quiet, chic space that I think will be tremendously helped out once light rail opens in a few months. The wine list is nice and covers a wide range of palattes. I've had the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc before which was good, and also had a glass of another white whose name escapes me. The second white I had was poured for me by the very friendly bartender Jeff...I told him what kind of wine I liked and he hand-selected one for me to try. It's not on the ""wine by the glass"" menu, so he opened the bottle and poured me a glass. I love when places do that!  The beer list while small has all of my favorite imports, so thumbs up on that as well.

The first time I dined at Cheuvront was for dinner and my friend and I started with the Brillat Savarin which was creamy and very much like brie...it was delicious. I loved how the server asked if we wanted more baguette when she saw we were running low because we still had a lot of cheese left.  I felt that the one cheese plate was a perfect size for two people to split as an appetizer. For dinner I had the caesar salad which was light and the perfect meal for a warm spring day.  I took a bite of my friend's Pizza Chevre which was really good and hearty.  

I most recently dined at Cheuvront for lunch today with a group of friends. Our waiter was incredibly pleasant and even though the menu said they do not split checks, he was very nice about running two credit cards and breaking cash to make change.  Everyone at the table seemed very pleased by what they ordered. I had the macaroni and cheese which comes with a side salad. The mac and cheese was the perfect lunch sized portion and the salad was light and crispy.  Prices are very reasonable for both wine and food.

Cheuvront is a great spot for lunch, dinner, or just to sit at the bar and try a new wine or two.  I know I will be there in the future especially with Kristin S. moving so close to it!"

1,"Weak.  This place is a far cry from the Mill Ave. location in Tempe.  Gone now.  Long Wong's quality is lost on this place.  I had pizza and wings and my slice was literally microwaved to heat it up after I ordered.  Bad, bad, bad.  Wings have always been decent, but there's really no reason to go there ever again."
1,"One thing that I love about OSF is that they offer gluten-free pasta for those of us who have wheat/gluten issues. The one thing that I hate about OSF is that you never know if they will actually have the gluten-free pasta in stock. Usually the server will inform me upon ordering that they are out of my pasta, which is aggravating but at least we can determine if we want to stay or not before actually ordering. This time we placed our order, received our drinks, ate our dinner salads, and then (a full 30 minutes after we placed the order) the server informed me that they were out of gluten-free pasta. Apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order. So not cool. We just paid for our drinks and left."
1,allthough the pizza is pretty good  the delivery service is a rip off if you have half and half  its an extra $1.50 even if one half is just pepperoni # $3.00 delivery and then tax on top it makes the pizza pretty dam expensive   so i will not use them anymore
1,I called in and made an appointment for 1:30 giving me plenty of time to get my haircut and make my massage appointment 1/4 mile down the street.  I show up at 1:25 and someone is in George's chair just starting to get their hair cut.  When I walk in nobody says anything to me so I sit down and wait.  At 1:45 (15 min past my appointment time and still no one has said a word to me) the guy is still getting his hair cut and he is not even close to being done.  So I tell George I can't wait any longer because I will miss my other appointment.  He tells me we still got time to hang out a little longer.  At 1:50 he finally decides he doesn't have enough time to cut my hair.  You are supposed to be hair cutting professionals.  You should know how long it is going to take to cut someone's hair.  If the person before me showed up late for their appointment why should mine be pushed back? or When I walked in why not tell me hey we are running 30 minutes behind can you wait?  Instead you say nothing absolutely no common courtesy nor do you care that you wasted an hour out of my work day with this.  Someone at Dick and Arnies explain this to me WHAT IS THE POINT OF MAKING AN APPOINTMENT IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO STICK TO THE TIME SCHEDULE?  I AM A BUSY PERSON AND DO NOT HAVE TIME TO SIT AROUND ALL AFTERNOON FOR A HAIRCUT!   Needless to say I am in the market for a new barber.
5,Oyster Po'Boy is money.  Their bread is really good and the taste is unique.
5,"This is the place.  Now known as La Rosita. The grocery selection is fine, great hot sauce selection BUT go on a Saturday or Sunday when you can order freshly prepared taqueria food as good as any I've ever had, and I lived on Milwaukee's south side most of my life. 

The carnitas are terrific, just had to say it.  I bounce from the torta with your choice of meat (and bear in mind this is a butcher shop, so they make their own barbacoa and carnitas and marinated chicken, lengua, etc), to huaraches when you can get them, to just a simple soft taco.  This is the real deal, no Taco Bell Doritos taco here.  At $1.75 a taco, and they're huge, wow.  Oh, and the salsas they make are great, the red has a mighty nice zip.  

Oh, final word - house made chorizo.  Holy crap.  OK, that was five words, but it's unlike any I've had before.  Complex, perfectly spiced, a slight hint of cinnamon, not greasy, simply great.  You can order it on to-go food at the taqueria on weekends, or by the pound in their butcher shop (raw).  I use half, freeze half."
5,"Best kept secret on pet supplies in Phx.  Those hair combs that pull out your pet's extra fur...the furminator i think it's called...1/2 the price in here compared with the regular pet stores.  The staff is very helpful too if you're looking for a specific item!  They have a catalog you can look thru as well, which seemed to help me a lot as this place is a warehouse, not really a store!"
1,this restaurant is not wheelchair accessible. I have no idea how the food is because there are 2 steps and no ramp.
5,"5 stars because 

1) it's Culver's and 

2) I refuse to let an LA resident (Tracy G) weigh down the supreme awesomeness that is Culver's based on her misunderstanding of cheese curd availability!"
1,"I was feeling eager for a gel manicure since I had just taken off my false acrylic nails.
They looked awful. 

It was Saturday and felt the need to relax so I decided on a pedicure as well.
I chose this place since it is close to my boyfriends house. 

I walked in and was greeted right away.
For a weekend, it was not packed at all. In fact, they were over staffed.

I was rushed to the pedicure chair. A man was assigned to my nails and a woman to my feet. What for? I mean, I wasn't in a rush and there was plenty of staff on duty.
I was being small talked... like ""oh my gosh you so beautiful"" blah blah.. you know!

I swear I wasn't even there for 20 minutes.. That was the fastest pedicure and gel manicure ever in my entire life! Let alone the quicket $52 ever spent.
And, I mean my pedicure was super basic and so was the quality of my gel manicure.

Oh, and btw! They only take cash!
They have an ATM in the salon.
Smart, right?

 Never again will I step foot in this shop.
Bummer"
1,Pharmacy: They only have 1 person staffing this location. Takes more than 30 minutes to fill a Rx.
1,"Want a room with scary stains and torn carpeting?

Want a ""complimentary breakfast"" so gross you'll feel like a contestant on Fear Factor?

Want the most incompetent front-desk employees in the history of the world?  

If you answered ""yes"" to any of those questions, this is the place for you!!!  
If you answered ""no"", stay at the Madison Hostel.  It's about 10x cheaper and about 1,000x better."
1,"I use to like Ulta. At least, I think I did. I often went to the Ulta at MetroCenter before it closed, and when it did, I had no choice but to start visiting this Ulta. If it were not for the specific makeup I needed I wouldn't bother coming here. The customer service is non-existent. These so-called makeup artists or whatever they are, shouldn't even exist. To this day, not one of them has ever offered to help me when I go to the store. They stare at me when I walk by but continue chattering away to each other, or seek out the one blonde in the store. I walk in, pick up what I need and get the heck out of there. 

The stuff is overpriced. You can get the drugstore brands of makeup for way cheaper anywhere else. The coupon thing is a joke. The points are a waste. Spend hundreds of dollars for a free hair brush?! Are you kidding?!"
1,"These people were so unbelievably rude to me. They were rude on the phone, they were rude when I picked my order up. I am not going back even though the food was good, not worth being treated like you are the smallest person in the world. There are a handful of other deli very very close that are just as good."
5,"You won't be disappointed. We've eaten here about 7 times now, and we are ALWAYS delighted. The Beef Panang is just killer. The strips of beef are incredibly tender and of high quality. I usually find that the strips are a perfect medium (which I didn't know was possible in Thai cuisine). The sauce, ohhhhhh the sauce. Pour it over the rice (if you get it to go) and just love.

Personally, my favorite is the yellow curry. Look, I've had Thai Elephant, Thai-E-Sam, Thai Basil, and another Thai joint in Phoenix that I can't remember. Yellow curry is my dish. It's absolutely the best here. Every time I eat it, my scalp tingles and I slip into a blissful happy place. The steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart. The little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing. The duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile. I know there's something with peanut sauce (satay?) that makes me happy.

Appetizers and desserts are up to you. If you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls, they're great here. If you like coconut ice cream, do it. If not, you can probably skip these as they cost as much as the entrees. 

Another note: don't come here thinking this is 100% authentic Thai cuisine. It's definitely Thai...but upgraded. In my opinion, it's perfect. It's also a good place to take someone on his or her first taste of Thai."
5,"Right off the freeway, next to a gas station. We couldn't visit Wisconsin without a trip We had low expectations since it looked cheesy (yes I said it) from the outside and we expected this place to be a regular liquor store. But it is truly a wonderful world of cheese, fudge,  great wine end beer selections. they have a table where you can sample any of their many cheese spreads. Here are some of the flavors: taco, smoked, port wine, bacon, pumpkin, cranberry, garlic, etc. So many choices, so little money unfortunately. Then there was the selection of blocks of every kind of cheese. 
The staff was very knowledgable and helpful. You can sample pretty much everything besides the alcohol, of course. I love this place and would come back someday, if I want to make the 9 hr drive again. But I got a brochure so I can order online too."
5,If you have not been here go. Best breakfast in Dane county. I work out of state and every time I get to town this is my first stop. If I get in town at 2 am I am up at 7 for breakfast. Bring and tell your friends you wont regret it.
5,"I'm not a die hard BBQ fan nor do I normally spring for it when I'm hungry but after eating here I may change my tune.
The ribs are amzaing, the meat practically falls off the bone and is so tender!! The pulled pork sandwich is equally delicious and the serving size is more than generous. The sweet bisquits are a nice way to end the meal, served piping hot and covered in powdered sugar; although ordering them serperate is recommended as the baked beans and fries are a must have!!"
5,"Yum!  Party of 7, everyone ordered their own dish and then shared with all.  Started with pot stickers and shrimp ragoon.  Grilled pot stickers were really good, could have just eaten those and been happy.  Appetizers came with a variety of dipping sauces.  Best dishes sampled were crispy orange beef, almond chicken and generals lamb.  Lamb was way tender, excellent choice.  Service was prompt and friendly, great atmosphere.  Ended meal with delicious mango ice cream.  Left happy and very full!"
1,"When we called the Motel before we arrived, they said they had plenty of rooms available, but when we got there the manager spent about 10 minutes searching for a room for us (said several were in the middle of some maintenance.  As we went to our room, we noticed there were many rooms that did not appear to be occupied at all (the drapes were open and rooms were dark.)  This was the same story and situation the past 3 times we stayed here.  I think they just close rooms off, period.

Found a used condom on floor under the bed and the wall near the sink had some drip stains from something I won't even hazard a guess about. There is no way that room had been properly cleaned or sanitized.  We will absolutely not be back here again."
5,"I have walked by this place dozens of times. Being inspired by my name, I should probably have stopped in here more often. The one time I did (to have a watch cleaned) they were quick and courteous, definitely a locally owned,  family run business.

This is now in the ""places named after me"" list for the quest. (more details in the list - Michaels unite!)"
5,"OK -- not much else to add to what has already been said, creepy looking place but knock your socks off good Mexican food.

I've driven by this place on my way to work for nearly 4 years and always thought it was a bit too dumpy even for me. 

LEST WE FORGET - the crappier looking, dingy, run down, hot, windowless, next to a bus station types of Mexican food places are the BEST. This one has all the above. Its cheap too.

I had the chimichanga with beef machaca. So freaking good. Probably the best chimi I've ever had next to Rito's, of course. But this place has better hours :)"
1,"I would give this BK a -1 star if I could. They just recently renovated their building, cool, looks nice. I've stopped going to this location, it is the worst in fast food. Once i was told in the drive-thru that they were out of meat, but had chicken or fish. LOL Seriously! The king of burgers out of meat!?!?!? The wait in the drive-thru is painfully SLOW! I once ordered, waited for like 10-15 minutes, got fed up and left. Drove over to Wendy's, got my food and drove past BK on the way home. The truck i was behind in the drive-thru was still in the same spot! Crazy. 

This BK NEEDS better management and training for the employees. They just don't seem to care. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
1,"If you like waiting for a long time for your appointment, dealing with rude medical professionals, and getting yelled at later when you want your test results sent to your primary care doctor, this is the place for you to go."
5,"I'm a Realtor and I had recently finished showing a Buyer Townhomes and Condos in Downtown Phoenix. I was looking for a good healthy place for lunch, and I of course pulled out my phone and turned to Yelp for their recommendations. Coronado Cafe came up as one of the highest ranked in the area and they did not disappoint.

Located within a 1920's built house this charming cafe served up some of the best lunch time fare that I've had in sometime. Not only that but they have wonderful Bloody Marys that were only $3. I went with a half sandwich and side salad. My sandwich was the Pest Chicken and it was delicious as was the salad. My business partner is from Baltimore and when he heard the waiter state that they have the best crab cakes in town he naturally ordered them. He, being an expert on crab, was immediately transported back home with his first bite. After speaking with the owner we discovered that he too is from Baltimore and has the crabs flown in special for his crab cakes. So if you're a crab cake lover or simply a lover of good food Coronado Cafe is a must stop for you."
1,"Worst pulled pork sandwich ever.  Had to ask for extra BBQ sauce, but still didn't kill the taste.  Slow service as well.  No reason to return."
1,"We eat out 2-3 times a week and travel extensively, eating out. We  were not impressed at all.  It was noisy, service was poor and the Lamb Shank had about two bites of meat in it.  Not worth a visit."
1,"Don't let this place fool you. To keep the story short the server, Erica, said there was no merlot. Okay. Ordered a couple Malbecs ($8 each) instead. When we got the bill she charged the order as both Merlots ($10 each).  She never told us she had it on stock. It was more like...surprise! Let's charge them more bc either the server is thinking a) I don't know what they ordered or b) I'm gonna charge more so I can get a bigger tip. For that we gave her $3 for lying to us!! Btw def didn't taste like a merlot.  Checked my credit card charges for 2 separate receipts few days later. The server gave herself more than 20% tip when I clearly put zero on one and $3 on another receipt for 3 drinks -- purposely!!! She doesn't deserve it! 

Called the manager a few days later and short story was the manager, Adam was trying to sound professional but totally sounded annoyed. Yes it's only a few dollars but the whole principle behind their service was shady to say the least. Adam said he would call back a couple days later. Nope!! One week went by and no one called me back. So guess what? I called back. Spoke with another manager, Francisco. He told me that Adam said it was an INCONVENIENCE for him to reverse the charges and that it will cost them!!!! Hahahahahaha really??!!?? You have to be kidding me! What kind of service is this!?? They're worried about a few dollars rather than their reputation??? Wow!! That really says a lot about them. He told me the only way to get credit back is to come back for a free drink. How about NO!! Why would I go back to a place that is shady? Anyway he said Adam will call me back. We will see about that. Maybe they will when they see this. 

Also I agree with the other reviews from Rick and Rich. Going cheap on the Moscow mule by serving it in a smaller glass. Classic."
1,"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST SERVICE IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I gave this place 1 star because the food is truly amazing. Too bad the manager has absolutely no clue what he is doing. Probably gets tipped on the side by ""regular"" patrons and believes that's where his priorities should be at. First of all I made reservations for my mother's 60th birthday because the food here the first time was great. But did I mention the first time I was here our server made a mistake on every single food item we ordered?? At least he had the decency to get our desserts to make it up. An hour or two before the reservations we had called to see if we could add two more people. They told us fine and moved us up to 9pm for the private dining area. Well we showed up exactly at 9 and our room was not ready. Ok no big deal. A little annoying cuz what's the point of making reservations but we were ok. But after 20-30 min of waiting, I started to get pissed. I told the manager and he actually had the nerve to blame it on me!!!! That I called and added two people last minute!! Isn't it his job to make sure that this doesn't happen?!!! If he couldn't accommodate 8 people then say so and we could have went somewhere else. Also the whole time, he was even apologetic and instead of offering maybe a round of drinks for the wait or anything, he just stood around doing nothing!!! So we left and went to Capital Grille instead. We were very happy to celebrate and spend tons of money where we didn't have to wait and the manager and staff knew what they were doing!!! I will never go here again and if u want to go just expect to wait at least am hour even w reservations!!!!!"
1,"My husband and I are avid Chipotle fans... usually the service at most locations is good, sometimes great. THIS location on the other hand is TERRIBLE. I could write a book on the many occasions we have experienced atrocious customer service. I hope the owner of this location wises up and reads the reviews. A change in staff is necessary!! Food is still good, but if you're looking for good service.. Spend your money elsewhere."
5,"I have been eating at Blue Fin for easily 10 years. This family owned restaurant in midtown phoenix, is well worth the drive! The food is fantastic and the service is worlds beyond any other business i have been too. My favorite is the Beef Bowl special!"
1,"Ekkk! We went here after reading great reviews and seeing that it was one of The Arizona Republic's top 10 chinese spots in the Valley.

Nothing was good, I'm sad to report. The sweet and sour soup had such an odd overly bitter taste, it really wasn't edible. I ordered their version of Happy Family and the ""spicy brown sauce"" was watery, sweet and made the veggies soggy. My husband ordered the bell pepper chicken, which was just OK.

We got our order to go, otherwise I would have sent the soup and my dish back. And maybe would have had a different experience...

We've had such a hard time finding a good traditional chinese place in Phoenix."
5,"One of the best BBQ restaurants I've been too. The place looks a little run down, but it only adds character. Open late (til 9:30pm I believe) this is a quick, easy lunch or dinner for us.

My favorites are the BBQ beef sandwich, potato salad and the cobbler is great too. A definite must! And there are multiple locations throughout the Valley."
5,"Stopped in for a dinner after getting a recommendation from a co worker and we were VERY impressed!  It was fairly quiet on a Thursday night - no problem getting a table.  The location is fabulous being right on the lake with views.  The ambiance is very much a north-woods tavern restaurant type establishment - older decor, a little kitschy, though it suits the place, well.

Green Lantern has a reputation of being a surf-turf and they do it well!

I had the Ahi-tuna - it was an incredibly delicate piece of fish cooked perfectly.  My wife had a steak which was also prepared very well.  We are DEFINITELY coming back!

The server, while young and a bit 'nervous', did a fine job and she was very pleasant.  She also provided great suggestions for food pairings!  Well done :)

Hint:  Ask for a seat by the window to get a view of the lake.
hint hint:  The location, ambiance, and setup is VERY family and kid friendly!  They were hosting a birthday party for a grandmother while we were there and the staff bent-over backwards for the family and party - including setting up a powerpoint projector for family slide show and music!  Very sweet...."
5,"This is a review that has been delayed for awhile.

I am from LA in California & let me say that I tried a lot of Thai food due to vast Thai restaurants available in LA. This restaurant by far have the best Thai food I have ever had."
1,"Terrible terrible customer service! I travel a lot for work and never have stayed at a hotel where there were so many employees that are only interested in talking with each other. For example, I ate breakfast at the restaurant and had to get my own coffee and refills- no I did not have the Buffett!"
5,"I can count on Dave.   He is HONEST.  A trait hardly seen in the car repair business these days.  I am afraid to buy anything other than a VW because I would never want to lose ""my mechanic.""  He's simply the best.  - Bob M & Sile S."
1,"In all seriousness, I have heard good things about this place from several people, I kind of walked in and was trying to think what the hell was the theme here, seriously if PETA ever went in here they would close this place down, with stuffed animals on the walls they would have a field day. I would say from start to finish I was thoroughly not impressed. I will honestly say that I will probably never go back to this location. It wasn't even that the food was just blah, but the fact that the staff seemed to ignore me, maybe I was under dressed for this establishment. I guess my money truly is no good here, because I honestly did not feel the staff gave two fucks about me the whole time I was there. Garbage. I grabbed a card on the way out from I believe was the hostess. Torri McFarland...you and your staff from the top down got work to do this place sucks!!!"
5,"Ordered lunch for pickup. It was ready when I got there, the place is clean, cool and refreshing. The food was SO FLAVORFUL!!!! No soggy bland phad thai here! The SO GOOD. :) I will DEFINITLY come here again."
5,"Just went to the pirate exhibit this weekend and I want to write a review because it was by far the coolest one yet.  I have been to the body exhibit, the titanic exhibit and others there.  Of course there is more to do there than just that for the kids, they blow stuff up at the lab, they have tons of cool little sections with things to do.  It is not cheap but we got the annual pass for the exhibits this year since we did the maze and we wanted to come back for the pirate and the Van Gogh exhibit coming next.  Now back to the pirate exhibit, holy cow they had a real life pirates treasure at the end that was valued at 400 million dollars!  The have tons of real ""pieces of 8"" they also recovered the bell from the original ship they found off the cost of Cape Cod.  There was their silverware, belt buckles, guns, cannons, gold, silver, rope, and I can go on forever.  It was just super cool to hear the story and see all the real life stuff.  This is not just a kid exhibit and in fact I spent much more time reading things and my kids blew right through it."
5,"The 5 stars are for the Real Pirates exhibit, in one word, AWESOME. They bring us top quality exhibits :)

If I was just rating the museum I'd give it 4 stars. They've got a great variety of hands on activities, but I do get strange looks when I get in line to try them,,,,, & everyone else is of elementary school age :D For this reason, if you are NOT in elementary school & you will not be taking young kids, I would recommend trying to go during school hours. That way you get to try all the hands on activities :) & they are fun!! 

There is an IMAX theater & Planetarium on the first floor. 
On the second floor (I'm pretty sure of the location) there is a SKY CYCLE.... sooo cool! I'm afraid of heights and have yet to take the ride, but one day soon, it's gonna happen! lol! If you or your kids want to do it you have to meet the height requirements, fit into the harness & you need to wear tennis shoes. No high heels or flip flops ladies :)
There's a rock climbing wall,,, but for the life of me I can't recall what floor it's on,,, but it's there. 

I would recommend grabbing a bite before or after the museum. They have a little cafe on the first floor, but I would leave that for emergencies, like your blood sugar dropping or a toddler who must have a cookie :)

All in all, great place to spend the day!"
1,The staff sucks beyond rude. Shouldn't be in business. Don't know how to make drinks. Don't waste your time or money going to this place. The nut job lady in the morning needs to be on meds.
5,"This is by far my favorite book store.  I never walk out of the place empty-handed.  Awesome selection and quick turnover in my favorite categories.  One can purchase new books for a song- I just picked up the 2012 Gun Digest for ten bucks, when it ordinarily sells for forty.  

I have never had a bad experience with staff, they've always been helpful.  Keep up the good work HPBs!"
1,"The BF and I met up with a friend for dinner on a Friday night around 7 PM.  It was when First Fridays were going on, so it was busy when we arrived (but not too crowded).  The ambiance makes the place feel like a local dive bar, which we didn't mind.  It seems like the kind of place that you can drop into for a cocktail on a nice Saturday afternoon.  But...

The menu looks like it was written by a kid in the first grade.  Some people would find that charming, but we found it a bit trying.  Also, it was written on one piece of white paper.  There were NO descriptions of any of the food.  So we had to ask the wait staff about the items we were interested in, which would have been fine, but...

The wait staff.  Hmph. A bit slow.  And totally unknowledgable.  They didn't know what was in the items.  We asked, and then items showed up with things on it that we were not expecting (and didn't like).

The food was NOT GOOD.  I ordered the shawarma.  It was TERRIBLE.  No flavor at all.  The chicken was boiled and had no seasoning.  The tahini sauce had no flavor at all.  I asked for some taztiki sauce to see if it would help.  It did not.  It was the WORST shawarma I have ever had.  However, the potato salad was tasty.

The BF had the lamb gyro which he said was nothing special (very average).  And my friend ordered the italian sandwich, which he liked.  For the price of the food, everything should have tasted better.

Drinks were expensive.  A rum and coke in a place that looks and feels like a dive bar was $7.  SERIOUSLY?  Wow.  Unless you go during happy hour, the prices don't seem worth it.  They did have a good beer selection, and all of those (besides the super cheap ones) were $5 each.  That seemed reasonable.

Finally, the music.  Ugh.  They had this guy with a guitar get up and sing/play.  He was terrible.  And it was SO LOUD we could barely hear each other.  Plus the table behind of us of older hippies were doing shots and whistling at the end of each song.  Getting rowdier and rowdier.  Great for them that they were having a good time.  Sadly, it just wore us out.

I doubt I will return to this place.  And if I do, it will be for one drink, during happy hour, on a day when I can sit outside."
1,"Yeah, walked in, took one one look around, one whiff of air, and walked right back out. My impression in that 30 seconds was enough to send me packing. Gross. Crowded. Humid and smelly. Tiny area and tiny selection of books. 

I am a library lover. And this place is only a mile from me, so if there was a chance of it being worth my time I'd go, but no. Yuck."
5,"I went to see ""Saving Tania's Privates"" on 10/09/10. The Phoenix Little Theatre was a perfect venue for this event. Since the show had some delicate and poignant scenes, the small stage was perfect for showcasings these gems. Tania  Katan is deserving of a purple heart for courage for her role as sole writer and performer of this fact based phenomenon. The theatre is small and intimate, ensuring there are no ""bad seats"" in the house."
1,"I went in tonight with a date. This was my first time there. I dressed up to be treated so rudely! We left so upset because of the staff was not even wanting to take care of us, and the place was pretty dead.

I am a 40 year old woman, and to have 20 year old women ignore me and be rude! I was so insulted. I went and spoke to the manager before I left. She was completely flippant about the situation. 

I told her I was extremely upset with our service we were never served food and that I was going to write a review.  She smiled ignored me and walked away. 

We were seated not served and treated rudely. I would never recommend this place the staff working July 6, 2014 should be fired. The Manager should not be allowed to talk to customers or be on the floor. I've never been treated so bad. I came home and wrote this crying. That's not a good night out! My date was so upset. He spent the whole night apologizing to me."
1,"We have tried twice to eat here, and twice it has been closed. Yet every time I drive by it, the parking lot is packed. What restaurant doesn't serve dinner on Saturdays?"
1,"Scott's Generations? Never again. I've been wanting to try Scott's for years. I love deli, and I was very disappointed by the food, service and overall experience I had at Scott's today. 

During the end of the lunch rush Scott's was empty. That should have been a sign. The restaurant was filthy. The temperature was hot and sticky despite having the the door open (it was about 72 in phoenix today.)

The booths had exposed cushioning, tables hadn't been cleared or cleaned and the floor looked like something that belonged in an episode of kitchen nightmares. Ignoring these details was a poor choice on my part. 

My friend and I finally found a clean-ish booth and sat down. Our table was dirty, and when the waitress came by I had to ask her to wipe it off even though there were visible crumbs and our menus were sticky. She acted like it had never occurred to her to clean a table off before. She actually tilted her head when I asked her to do so, as if she had been confused by the request. We should have just left. 

We ordered our food. I got a pathetic bowl of matzo ball soup, my friend a sad looking chicken noodle. I had one very tiny measly looking matzo ball, and the veggies had been cooked to death. There were chicken bones in my soup. The flavor tasted like it had been seasoned with a generic version of Stouffer's dressing mix. 

I ordered a lean pastrami and asked for it to go. It came to our table without fries  accompanied by the saddest, wilted coleslaw. It was not prepared to go. The pastrami was fatty (despite the menu bragging about how they don't charge extra for lean) The pickles were great, and house made. The pickles were the only bright spot of the meal. 

My friend asked if they had soda by the bottle, the waitress forgot that they carried Dr Brown's (a deli staple) and I had to jog her memory. She forgot the request twice and after being reminded twice she finally brought the soda.

By this point I was so over it I just wanted to leave. I asked for a box, she over charged us, I didn't give a flying fig about that and over paid just to be able to leave. 

Six hours later my stomach is upset. I won't be returning. I may be calling the health inspector. Like many generational things, I hope Scott's gets left in the past."
1,"IT'S THE 1982 WEDDING RECEPTION THE BRIDE'S DAD DECIDED TO HOST IN HIS HALFWAY REMODELED SUNROOM/PORCH YOU WERE HOPING TO FORGET.

--flashing colored lights were in bad taste, even THEN
--live music is only redeeming quality, and it's BAD
--belly dancer goes after EVERYONE in the room. yes, it's THAT wedding reception
--stackable vinyl elk's lodge chairs lost their cush in 1984. HOW can they still be in use?

--NO ONE actually wants to eat a pile of raw onions buried under globs of mucousy ""greek"" dressing.  WHY!!?
--everything's in 1982 except the prices. You want me to pay $20 for that?!?

Now I know why no one has ever mentioned this place to me _in my entire life_. Some places are better left undiscovered."
5,"o.k. it is Pedros, but the baked Friday night fish is the best I had in Madison.  Great texture, spices, the rye bread, chipotle sauce and coleslaw were great too.   Of course the freshly baked tortillas were fattening and awesome.  The atmoshpere is a little off, but a great surpise for Friday fish."
5,"Marvelous little breakfast spot. My husband and I spent the weekend in Middleton and came here twice because it was so good! 

Really enjoyed the ambience, ordering at the register and having our food come out to the table. The fair-trade coffee was outstanding, as were the oatmeal with berries and breakfast sandwich. I was particularly blown away by the chocolate croissant, which I couldn't imagine could trump my favorite at Bennison's in Evanston IL but it was deliciously buttery, flakey and had the best chocolate filling I've ever had in pain chocolat! My husband swore that his mocha was the best he's had in his life. Kind of makes us want to move out here!"
1,"I was very excited to try Majerle's several years ago.  I am a huge Suns fan, and we usually eat dinner near the arena before games.   Needless to say I was so disappointed. The food was not great and while we were eating a HUGE roach went crawling up the brick wall next to our table.  I couldn't finish my dinner and I hightailed it outa there!!! Never ever been back!!!"
5,Amazing!  Simply all around great.
5,"So good. Went for the lunch buffet. 9 bucks. Everything was amazing but the mango chicken, curry chicken, and jerk pulled pork were highlights. This place is a gem for anyone that wants authentic, amazing food at a ridiculous price. I want to try the dinner buffet next time im in town. 
The ladies working there are also very nice. The decor isnt anything special but I hardly noticed. Great food, great price. Go in hungry and leave happy."
1,Going out of business sale is a joke. Drove up from Chicago and it was a complete waste of time! Prices are extremely high - electronics are higher than best buy. Furniture needs another 50% off to even consider buying floor models. Customers were all walking around complaining about the price.
1,"This place came HIGHLY recommended by a friend of mine, and so when my car's brakes went all squishy, I took it in.   First, the good:  This place is sooo clean, the guys are all awesome, polite, knowledgeable and you just get a great sense of being in a respectable place.   

The bad: One the way out the door, the mechanic that checked me in mentioned that it would be ""Fifty bucks to check out the car, and we'll call you with a quote.""

The quote came in for almost $900, which was far more than I was able to pay.   When I got back to the shop to pick it up, I was charged $61.34. I questioned the difference between what I was told and what they charged me, and apparently it was $55 for the inspection, plus shop rags, plus tax.  I guess I should have seen this coming?   I have never been charged to look at the car.  And certainly not $62 for a ten minute inspection. 

I was in the market for a new mechanic, but this is NOT the one that I will be going with.  They were somewhat surprised that I would fuss at all about the $12 difference.  As if I should have expected a 30% markup from what they told me.  Not a great way to build a relationship.  If they had told me before they took my keys and information about the cost of the inspection, quite honestly, I would have taken my car somewhere else.

Bottom line:  I think that if you know you are going to get work done, these guys look really top notch. But be prepared to pay for it.

UPDATE:   I just finished repairing the car myself, and what these guys wanted to charge me $900 for, I was able to do myself for $140.  And that included buying a $20 set of drum brake tools, and a $25 Chilton's manual.  They told me that it would $130 JUST to bleed the brakes, which I did in about ten minutes with nothing but a pair of channel locks.   I am reducing my stars down from two stars to one, because they were OBVIOUSLY out to rip me off, not just charge me a premium for premium service."
5,Dr Austin is incredibly thorough with pt and family history. She personally spent a lot of time with me. Dr. Austin has awesome bedside manners and is very personable. This is a small well run office. Staff is also personable. Dr. Austin is a stellar example of a great doctor. I can't imagine that a patient would be turned away if they showed up in need without an appointment.
5,"I really don't understand all the complaints about this place.  I've been going here for years, and the food has always been solid, cheap, quick and really tasty.  The menu is huge, and I have no complaints about the service or cleanliness of the place, either.  

I usually get the fried tofu with garlic sauce.  It's transcendent.  Crispy, delicious triangles of fried tofu and a fantastic mushroom-garlic-onion sauce with some brown rice....I have dreams about it.  If I have the cash, I'll get some spring rolls with spicy mustard, which are a hot, crispy delight.

Haters gonna hate, I guess.  I just wish it was open all night!"
5,"Outstanding! This was our first time here and it was great. The server was very nice and responsive (he could have known a little more about the wine selection, but that wasn't a big deal). The food was great, light sauces and tons of flavor. We will definitely be back!"
5,This review is for the summer camp held here:  what can I say this was one of my child's favorite summer camps around Phoenix and we did a lot of them. The lion king production by these kids was excellent for one week of preparation.  They can't stop talking about this experience.
1,"This was our second venture to this joint: the first time was a disaster as we didn't even get noticed once so no food or drink was to be had. The staff gets perfect marks for ignoring us, This time the joint wasn't to busy so figured we would have a decent chance at getting service. Well we sort of got service from a staff member who seemed annoyed we bothered her to order. The drinks were slow to come out and for beer it wasn't very cold. Before we could ask for waters our server ran away. We did finally order ""food"" the curry wings looked like a pile of gooey vomit and didn't taste much better. There were three of us at the table, each regretfully had one wing and shoved the rest to the side. I ordered the Halo burger which had a crisp cheddar ring around it which was the best part. The burger itself was something straight from the freezer, pre-made greasy as all can be. No flavor and the condiments that came with the burger were the standard fare. The steak fries as a side should have stayed in the kitchen. They were underdone and soggy. No flavor either. My wife ordered the french dip, something that usually you can't screw up. Well these guys at G&D are batting 1000 with subpar food, I've tasted better french dips at hospital cafeterias. Our friend ordered the Reuben grinder, he said it was OK, but again the fries stayed on the plate. Our wait staff was non existent. She never bothered to check on us once. We had to stand up to show that we were ready for our check...that really didn't work so our friend had to track her down. Plan to ask for your check well ahead of time as they do not value your time. I guess we are the idiots for trying the place again but really you might get em on a bad day so give them the benefit of the doubt and try em again. Well twice was WAY more than I will be spending there. I know they have a lot of regulars and maybe these folks are fine with the usual horrible AZ customer service and crappy food. I for one, coming from Chandler, like to enjoy a decent meal. We didn't order anything complex yet this joint managed to make even a simple burger just plain bad."
1,"SInce when does a trip to Starbucks take 20 minutes. No, I didn't get a fancy frapuccino order for 5 people at work. Actually, I only one an iced coffee and a regular americano. No reason to take that long, unless the person in front of you ordered enough sugar-based drinks to give you a sugar high for a month. Oh and maybe the fact that there are only 2 people working there on a busy morning has something to do with that. Either way, I would rather go to any other place for coffee or skip it all together. This Starbucks made me late to work and I cannot believe they have such a low standard of service."
1,"I had read good things about this place, so I was excited to try it.  Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience.  I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and split pea soup.  The food took forever to arrive.  When it finally got there, my grilled cheese was missing the tomato, and the cheese was not completely melted.  I ate it as-is, since I didn't have the time to wait for a new sandwich.  I subsequently opened the ketchup bottle which somehow exploded shooting ketchup all over the table and my clothes.  Not a great start.  The pea soup was ok, but there were too many croutons in it and not enough peas.  After finishing our lunch, we waited at the table for an incredibly long time and never got our check.  We decided to go stand at the cash register to see if that would help.  The staff completely ignored us for about 5 minutes before someone finally came to the cash register (not a big place, they saw us waiting).  The lady at the cash register did explain that they usually were not that busy, but for us it was too little, too late.  There is no second chance to make a first impression: I'm not going back."
1,"I am trying to love this place again and give it a thumbs up! You;'re killing me Royal palm Management! UGH! I  and went back a few weeks ago. I feel like I had this old boyfriend who was great and then he turned psycho and also didn't bathe again. So here I am searching for an old boy friend  which is what I am referring to - 'The Royal Palms resort' who was awesome in it's day, and NOW a mess- STILL.   The bar area  was changed and the entire main seating area is now entertainment wires and cords and the cheeeeziest  band. The furniture is filthy and the Bar tenders are REAL ass bites!!!! The food is tiny crappy taco type foods!!! Holy shit! Dear Daddy Warbucks: Do not take me here again! it is a  'HAS BEEN' place and now old and tired. Umm, like some of my dates!"
5,"The thoroughness of their prenatal care saved my baby's life. My first pregnancy was perfect with no problems, but my second pregnancy... not so much. I went in for my 18 week anatomy ultrasound, and as part of that exam they screened me for incompetent cervix (which many practices don't do). It turns out I had incompetent cervix and was well on my way to losing the baby. Most women don't learn that they have this condition until after they have lost their baby. Because of their diligence, I was able to take the necessary steps to save my baby.

The quality of the care at SWCWC is unparalleled. I highly recommend this practice."
5,"All I can say is greek salad, potato salad, and Zoe's signature slaw.( not all together though, you'll explode)  I hate picnic food, but this place puts a spin on it that you wouldn't believe. I practically go broke stopping here after work every day, but my job is so demanding that I fast all day...it's worth the wait!  And if you're ever in a rush, order your food ahead of time and just pick it up...then you don't have to worry about waiting all day for your food at the high rush time (around 11pm-1pm)"
5,"Me and the wifey came to have breakfast early Saturday morning.....was craving menudo....so I ordered menudo n the wifey the flautas plate. The waitress who attended us was very sweet n friendly.she took our order n brought us or drinks (large glasses which I like) another lady brought us chips n salsa.....chips were piping hot!!! There was a green n red salsa...I liked the the red better. 
My menudo was delicious just wish they had pata that day...ordered a small refried beans with cheese,  yummy!!!! All the condiments for the menudo was brought n available..
Wifeys Flauta plate looked delicioso!!! She loved it..
Gonna come back n try other menu items soon.
Over all food was delicious...service was awsome n friendly...and the price was great!!!"
5,"Stumbled across this place early on a Saturday morning. Had a great breakfast burrito and horchata at the tortilliaeria and only wish I had hours to walk the rows of great produce. 

Definitely going back!"
5,"This is a great place to go for a good, cheap breakfast that will fill you up.  You seat yourself, but the staff is still at your table taking your drink orders quickly.  The staff is always super friendly and all of the breakfast items I've tried have been great.  Even better, they keep your coffee filled even when it's busy! :-)  Only thing to know ahead of time is they only accept cash and there is no atm in the restaurant."
1,"Went there for lunch on 9/6/2013.  When we walked in the man at the front desk seemed uninterested and told us to seat ourselves.  We started to settle into a spot but got interrupted by a waitress who then seated us. Make up your mind people.  Menus came fast but without a drink order, we were both very thirsty as it was over 100 out side.  We also had to wait a bit long for the food order.  The staff seemed to pointedly ignore us and walk past our table again and again.  Our waitress eventually came to check on us but was so intent on speedily asking a quick question she started to walk away without a drink order again, we had to stop her.  

Food came promptly, with our drinks, but it tasted so so at best, about take out quality.  We chugged through the waters and soda very quick but the empty glasses sat at the edge of the table until we finally had to hold up an empty glass and yell over for someone to bring refills. Rude yes, but nothing else got any kind of attention.  

After we were done, yep you guessed it, waited forever for the check.  No excuse for a place with people at only 10% of the tables.

Another big issue:  They have a yelp coupon for checking in, even though it was presented at time of ordering, they WOULD NOT HONOR IT!!

Bad service, so so food and dishonest representation.  And we had been trying to get there for a long time.   At least it was cheap.

Update:  We were contacted by the manager regarding the coupon not being honored.  They said it was only for the dinner service.  Problem is, the coupon did NOT state that.  This makes it false advertising and constitutes fraud in my book.  Its called ""bait and switch"" draw them in with a false ad.  That only makes me feel worse about this place, can I take the one star back?"
5,"I've been at this location since it was opened and I must say this past weekend, I think I experienced the best service!  The Asian Chicken Salad -awesome!  Two people can eat this salad it's so BIG!  I was there twice this weekend, I also had a chicken sandwich which was great and fullfilling.  The waitress remembered what we drank so that was great.  I was with a large group of people and the staff at Majerle's took care of everyone really well.    The Strawberry Fields Salad looks really good as well, yumm!!!"
1,"I am pissed!  I have been attending the Wrigley Mansion for music on the patio for over a year now, and have been raving to all of my friends about it.  All the stars happened to align this last Sunday, and ten (10) of my friends attended with me.

I was embarrassed because it was no longer the same Wrigley.

In two weeks (since I was there last), all the rules changed.  The cool band, Delcoa, is no longer the band.  There is no longer a $7 buffet.  There remains half price bottles of wine, but they increased the price of the bottles.  Um, excuse me, but if I am going to a casual event on an outdoor patio, why the hell would I buy a $90 bottle of wine (discounted to $45...ooh, what a bargain)!!!?  I swear, even the outdoor lighting has been removed!!!

And they have no Facebook presence where I might have been notified...nothing different on the website to indicate a ""rebranding.""

They did still have a good crowd.  I think the crowd follows the band, so all of these people were new to me.  But they were not prepared.  The service was very poor.  (Remember, I was seated at a table of 10...Hello!!!?  Cha Ching!!!?)

It's likely I won't be back."
1,"Unfortunately my first experience at Runner's Den wasn't  good.  The guy we had was so rude and in such a hurry, he had the shoes rung up on the register before I even had my old shoes back on!  Maybe they were short staffed but you would think a Sunday at 1:30pm in the afternoon would be an OK time. They might be the best but not in service.  I'll never go back but will keep on running!"
1,"I wouldn't even put a star. We bought fish from them and asked their ""fish specialist"" if the fish we selected will get along. Of course she said yes. We have had our fish now for 3 weeks and one is obviously get attacked by another fish! Well petsmart thanks for that! Tetras are aggressive fish and attack others. Maybe they should teach their employees what they r talking about! No way am i going back to them! So uneducated and to top it off the woman that helped us made it seem like we bothering her!  Get it together petsmart! Ur losing customers!"
5,"We went here for my sister in law's birthday. I was anxious because my last time here was so unappealing, but this time was a whole different story! We ordered four appetizers to split and all of them were delicious. I had a steak which was cooked to perfection. The service was excellent. The wine they recommended was delicious. We split several desserts and they were delicious as well. I'm still on the fence about the place but our last time there was good enough that I will give it another chance to make my final decision."
1,"i love home depot. and i am there very often.

everybody at this location and every location i have gone to is always a little too helpful/bothersome... and more so, if i am there solo.

BUT, avoid this location if you're looking for any type of cutting services for lumber. there machine has been broken since october."
1,"I'm reluctant to write a negative review as I understand how hard it is to run a business, but the service I received today was abysmal. I have a group of friends that eat their regularly so I've seen this place go up and down with quality. 

The big issue is there's no attention to detail when the orders go back to the kitchen. They actually seem to have a tendency to do the exact opposite of what's requested. Don't get me wrong, when it's good it's good, but I've seen more food sent back to the kitchen at this restaurant than anywhere else. It's got to the point at times that I've seen the waiting staff actually argue with the cook.

When I arrived tonight my hopes were high, as the manager was actually here for the first time in months. She was aware that our group had complaints and actually came to talk to us about issues the kitchen of been having. After what seemed to be a constructive talk we placed our orders with the waitress with confidence. Well, needless to say my food was incorrect again. Not only was it wrong, it almost seemed intentionally incorrect. When I express my dismay the manager went and brought the cook out which made me very uncomfortable. 

At this point I was ready to cancel the order altogether, but they said they take the food back to correct it. What the manager brought to the table the second time was worse than the first. I wish I could say I couldn't believe it, but I've gotten quite used to this level of incompetence from this restaurant. I sent it back and told them to cancel the order altogether.

The only bright spot about this restaurant is the waiters and waitresses do seem to work hard, it's just the kitchen throws them under the bus with their incompetence and the management under staffs them so they always have too many tables.

I guess the only thing left for me to do is try and convince the 15 top that comes to eat there on a weekly basis that we need to start going to another restaurant, but my friends are a little stuck in their ways.

Ugh!!!"
1,"Placed a take-out order of vegetable pakoras, shahi paneer, garlic naan, and papadum. Did not receive the pakoras at all, the naan was COLD (not even lukewarm), the papadum was burned, and the shahi paneer was crappy. As your lawyer, I advise you to become a patron of any other indian place in the valley but this one."
1,"So this place is not a great place to take your kids for some ice cream .  I give the Ice cream four stars because its wonderful. The service gets three stars... not so great.  The food gets two stars...stay away from the turkey burger the meats gray and has no taste.  The daily special is your best bet if you are really hungry and cant wait to go someplace better.  The decor is nice and authentic for its time but I don't understand why it has an antique shop attached to it.  There isn't even a door separating the restaurant from a huge amount of vintage clothing.  Vintage cloths and kids with sticky fingers don't mix.  Of course my son wanted to look at all the vintage stuff and when he tried on an old hat (with my permission) an older woman(maybe the owner) yelled at him and told him "" the vintage cloths are not for dress up"".  I was going to buy the hat for him because I could tell that  he really liked it but if he cant even try it on I don't see the point.  We left the so called Ice Cream shop/Goodwill disappointed and a little angry that we had spent so much over $100 on food and ice cream for the family.  Even though this is an ice cream shop I wouldn't take your kids."
1,a dirty li.ttle hole.had a roach crawl on my hand. Joyce the bartender just laughed
5,"I've been in Madison for 16 years, and this is my favorite Madison restaurant, bar none."
5,"A Salvadorean friend recommended this place to us when she found out that we love papusas. I got  a massive plate of those crispy, delicious goodies and an even more massive cup of horchata, which could have been a meal in itself. Our server was super-friendly and patient--it took us forever to decide. We left stuffed and satisfied."
1,"We may not have a lot of bragging rights here in Phoenix, but being able to sit on a patio in November and have a few cocktails is such a luxury, especially when you bring along out-of-town visitors.  My friend from Denver won't see a patio for months, so I was thrilled to introduce her to Hillstone.  Maybe it was the fact that we were just having cocktails and not ordering food that set the weird tone of the evening - or maybe the wait-staff at Hillstone just sucks.

I'd been to Hillstone twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  I've always found them (Hillstone/Houston's) overpriced, but a nice night out.  The atmosphere is really nice, the food is not exactly innovative, but it's consistent.  I'm not going to get into a Houston's/Hillstone comparison here - the food is about the same as always, but the new location is very pretty.

My friends and I found a table on the patio and settled in for some drinks and girl-talk.  The fireplace was awesome and there are heaters placed here and there for us thin-blooded Zonies.  The waitress came along shortly to take our orders, and our Denver buddy got the first RULE of the evening.  She ordered a cocktail and asked for a double (Hey, we had some major catching up to do - we wanted a little alcohol to get us started.)  She was immediately informed by our sneery server that Hillstone does not serve doubles.  It's just not that sort of a place - they don't want to be known as a drinking establishment.  To break the awkward silence, I joked that maybe the server could bring my friend two drinks instead of a double, that got me nothing but an icy stare.  I ordered a diet coke and a shot of tequila.  I'm not a big drinker, but do like a little buzz now and then, so I get it quickly and then sip on my soda.  RULE#2 - I was told I could not drink my tequila all at once.  Hillstone does not allow ""shots"", so I must sip my shot of Hornitas.  OK, I'm 53 years old and this person is actually instructing me how to drink my beverage?  Really?

While we did enjoy our mandated cocktails and tried hard to follow the RULES at Hillstone, I'm afraid the tone of our much-anticipated evening just never really recovered.  It's a fun place, especially at night when the Cougars are out and on the hunt - great for people watching and relaxing, but I think the drink ordering moment proved so uncomfortable for our server that she left us high-and-dry for the rest of the evening.  We wondered if we were not Hillstone worthy as we searched for someone to bring us a coffee with Baileys.  We eventually flagged her down and got our beverages, but...it wasn't really fun to be there anymore.      

Hillstone staff please understand that your place of employment being kind of cool and pretty does not earn you the right to be jerks to your customers.  I won't be back.  Oh, and on a side note, Hillstone, the kitty litter floor on your patio is just weird.  I had to empty the sand out of my shoes several times.  

I wish Hillstone would get it.  Such potential - such a disappointment."
5,"Easy to get a reservation on about 30 minute's notice.  Promptly seated, very attentive staff, nice but simple drink, beer, and wine list.  Appetizers, salads and entrees all presented promplty and fresh from the kitchen.  Food quality was excellent.  Very accomodating of our unruly 4 year old and slightly late guests.  Attached to the Holiday Inn and the only real problem was the dhared parking, as we were staying at the hotel and eating at the restaurant, but had trouble getting a parking spot due to another hotel event eating up all the spots for both business.  Nice but nothing special in atmosphere and surroundings.  Would definitely go back for the food next time we are staying in the hotel or a nearby hotel, but probably would not go out of my way just for the food."
1,"I recently went to Serenity for a mani/pedi. My manicure was done first and the technician did a pretty good job, however she didn't clip my cuticles and the quality of work was not great for the money. Next came the pedicure which was a complete nightmare. I really liked the tech, but it was very clear he had never done a pedicure in his life. The polish was the most sloppy I'd ever seen. Thick and slimy, brush strokes everywhere due to it partially drying and him applying over and over. After that he spent at least 15 minutes trying to clean up the mess by using tons of cotton and acetone. My nails were left incredibly sloppy: polish on the nails was a mess, polish all over my toes, cotton stuck everywhere. Worse, the acetone caused more polish to run onto my toes. I had to go straight to a wedding afterwards, but I removed the polish when I got home that night. What's worse? The shaping of my nails was bizarre. Three of my toe nails were shaped like smiley faces, clipped all the way to my toe in the center of the nail and high on the edges. I was able to even them out slightly, but it will take them at least a month to grow back to a normal length. I was very disappointed with the quality especially at an Aveda salon."
5,"My new favorite store!!

I noticed that my Nikon D40x was getting dirty and needed to get cleaned.  I called around to a couple places and found it to be $95 for a cleaning.  When I called Photomark (that I've only heard good things about in the past), they told me it was $45!  Big difference!  I really needed it done on short notice and was kind of bummed when he said it would take a few days.  He heard the tone of my voice and asked me if I needed it soon and said he would rush it and have it done the next day.  Jay is awesome!!  

I'm pretty amateur and I was kind of intimidated walking in and talking to someone about the camera.  But Jay was so easy to talk to.  He didn't talk down to me like I was an idiot.  He didn't talk over my head about things.  He was so easy to understand and he explained everything to me.

I also purchased a speedlight while I was there and the sales staff was awesome.  I had my two loud toddlers with me and he was laughing while they ran around with me yelling at them not to touch ANYTHING!!

I love that they hold classes here.  I am planning on attending two of them.  I can't wait!!!"
5,"If you're looking for the unique, quirky, off the beaten path side of Phoenix, come to the Welcome Diner.  With 9 stools around a bar near a hot kitchen, it is a small place with a lot to see.  The cooks are very friendly and talkative, and will give you their opinion on their dishes if prompted.

Try the classic cheeseburger, fries, and soda - it's definitely a favorite.

The Welcome Diner is definitely small, but worth the wait (if there even is one.)  It is truly a treasure to the historic Garfield district."
1,"Smoke-filled bathrooms, gross food, even if the burgers are a buck.  Expensive bowling, but on the upside, only one of the bartenders is a tool."
1,"Oh yeah, this place absolutely blows. I'll enter in a new reason (though all mentioned are perfectly valid): Limited Clint Eastwood selections in the movie department. Fie!"
1,Went with an open mind to try something new and out of the ordinary. Ordered pig intestine stirfry but server talked me into boiled beef and fish. What a mistake!  Flavor was different but initially good. After a few mouths full I began to have a numbness in my lips and tongue. I left and was still charged for inedible food. My suggestion is to go to Panda Express. Terrible food and service to match.
1,"The unfriendly atmosphere at The Harmony Bar is its biggest failing.  At first I thought it was just sarcastic ""Soup Nazi"" humor, but soon realized that the prevalent hostile attitude there is genuine and that it trickles down from management to employees, customers, and even performers.  I've seen bar managers there either berate customers directly or berate the bartenders who then have to try very hard not to pass that negativity on to customers.

Also, it's downright embarrassing to be an audience member there when the bar mistreats the band.  I once saw a Harmony bar manager preempt an encore performance by turning on the overhead lights, jumping up on the stage, and literally grabbing the mike from a performer to announce that the show's over and that everybody has to finish their drinks and leave.  I was floored.  It was the first time I'd ever seen anyone kick a band off the stage just because they wanted to close their bar early.  

The kitchen staff works hard, and the food is decent.  Unfortunately, this is the only bar I've ever been to in Madison where I've been asked to pay for my dinner tab up front.  (There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab.) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service.

In short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.  There are too many other fun places to go in Madison for anyone to have to put up with the miserable buzz killing atmosphere that prevails at The ""Harmony""."
5,"Best Chinese food in Midwest.  I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, and the quality here matches any Chinese restaurant back home!"
1,"I took my teenage daughter's 1996 960 here late this last summer because it wouldn't pass emissions due to both oxygen sensors (allegedly) being dead.  So I turn to the Volvo specialists I've used lots of times before for my own Volvo with few issues...except perhaps for the uncomfortable, stony silence they give you when your budget is bottomed out and you politely decline one of their suggested, additional services while embarrassedly explaining that you'll have to wait to get it done until you have more money.  Very uncomfortable.

So I'm thinking, no problem, these guys know their stuff, right? Apparently it *was* a problem, because after I made an appointment and dropped off my daughter's car, it took them 3 weeks and over $600 and the car STILL doesn't run!  :/ 

Adding to this, my husband and I had to call every few days and ask for an update on the car because we weren't being updated on the progress of the repair at all.  Have you ever had to placate an impatient 17 year old girl who needs her car to get to and from school?  It's living hell.

In fact, during one of the calls I made about the car's status, I discovered that they had replaced both oxygen sensors but that wasn't the problem, but they thought they had sorted out what the new hold up was but that nobody had gotten around to calling us to let us know any of this yet, and when I authorized them over the phone to address the new issue the response to me was ""Well, we have all these other cars ahead of you now"".  Wait...what?  Am I not ALSO a paying customer that also had an appointment?  How did I suddenly lose my place in 'line' behind all these other customers?  Shouldn't you finish my car before starting work on a different car?  :/

So yeah, after 3 weeks and over $600 they finally declared that they just didn't know what else to do with it and we paid our bill and picked up the car.  Fast forward a few months and it still hasn't passed emissions and just sits in my driveway, covered in dust, because I gave Volvo Am I all the money we could scrape together to sink into it and now I'm nervous to spend another penny since they couldn't figure it out the first time.   

I'm not sure if I'm more offended that they thought we could afford repairs approaching half of the value of the car, or that we didn't deserve any follow up communications on the repair status, or that when I called to find out what was going on I discovered that we'd been dropped to the back of the line for no discernible reason whatsoever.

So yeah, I'm no longer a happy customer."
5,My favorite spot for Mexican food in the valley. I've been going there for years specifically for the white menudo. Their ground beef/potato tacos are incredible and I love that some of the servers have been there the entire time I have been going.
1,"I loathe to write a bad review for one of my favorite hobbies, drinking craft beer, however; Sun Up is a brewing company that I feel the need to never visit again, nor would I recommend beer lovers to go out of their way to stop in.

The majority of the beer was just plain boring, and warm to boot! They had a lager, wheat, amber, pale, oatmeal stout and a scottish red on draft.  None of the beer sampled tasted even close to what I would consider the fundamentals of that particular category, ie a very bitter amber ale and a sweet, and not-hoppy-whatsoever pale ale.  Even the root beer was flat and tasteless.  

I initially was going to give this place two stars, mainly because they do serve beer, and the bartender was nice,  but thinking about the beer, I have to knock this down to one star.  Sorry Sun Up, but you need to go back to the drawing board and create some good, basic craft brew."
5,"Today was my first visit to Bavarian, and while it was just an oil change and spark plugs, these guys were quick, fair and friendly, not to mention substantially less expensive than the dealer.  I will be taking my '07 335 back as needed in the future.

I realized last month it was time to walk away from the shiny showroom and free coffee after Chapman BMW on Camelback refused to complete repairs covered under the CPO warranty (thanks to their liberal definition of ""normal wear and tear"").  I'm glad I've found a place that will help ease the transition back into paying for maintenance and repairs."
1,Yellow Cab is the MOST untrustworthy and unprofessional cab company I have EVER dealt with.  They double charged me for an expensive cab ride.  They will not take care of you if you call them with a complaint.  You do not get to speak to a manager.  They refuse to come to the phone.  I am going to small claims court.
1,"Wow. They messed up the most basic stuff. Really horrible, all the way around.

Let's see-- asked for kreplach soup, which is not on the menu. They have matzo ball and they have mish mosh (noodles, matzo, kreplach). I asked for kreplach soup and they brought me one dumpling. So how many dumplings in the mish mosh? One, right?

The soup was also cold.

Chopped liver tasted like liver... ""Livery"". At better delis, the chopped liver is smooth and creamy-- slightly sweet. This was bitter and not smooth. Unpleasant.

On top of that, they served it with bagel chips... Which is great, except a few good sized bagel chips were cinnamon-raisen. You gotta be kidding me. With liver? Disgusting.

Meatloaf was a friggin' nightmare. Not sliced from a loaf, but a patty that was baked. Super well done, chewy crap. Served with a beef base gravy, and they used way too much beef base.

Carrots were overcooked; mashed potatoes were ordinary.

My bill was $43. With tip, $50. Service was polite, but a little slow.

I am so angry that I paid for this crap. This is the second worst meal I've ever paid for in my life. I'm 40.

Very, very bad restaurant. Ugh."
1,"Not sure what happened to the beef at Wendy's, BUT I have been to this location and the fish hatchery location and the newer thicker beef patties have a strange old meat flavor. Not sure when or if I will go back. This used to be a favorite. Very disappointed. I wish they would go back to the old style of burgers."
1,"HORRIBLE!. Sad to see one of my favorite regular lunch spots do a 180 and totally suck. Went a couple weeks ago shortly after 11:00 and the restaurant looked empty, yet a couple groups of six in front of us and our group of four were told it would be a 20 minute wait because they weren't staffed yet. WTF? We all left and took a short walk to Coach's Corner (my new favorite). Thought I'd give Friday's a another try today at lunch, don't want to burn myself out on coach's corner. Not real busy inside. Waiter tried to sit us at a table that was in the sun. My buddy and I balked. We asked for a table where we wouldn't totally bake, like more in the shady bar area. He told us that he couldn't guarantee that we'd get good service there. Again, we were like WTF? He said the bartender wasn't in yet, or the 2nd bartender wasn't in. His attitude was fairly arrogant. It almost appears like they've totally given up on the lunch crowd. I hope this review spares somebody the frustration that I've dealt with the last couple times I tried to eat there. I just tried to contact someone via their website but doesn't look like they want to hear about it. You CAN contact them about reserving tables for an event. Like I'd really want to do that now. Way too many places downtown now where your patronage will be appreciated."
5,"Imagine a Filliberto's sized menu selection, even larger, without the searing stomach pains post-meal. Throw in authentic southwestern Mexican dishes served quickly and a great bakery with a huge variety of fresh Mexican sweets and this place deserved five stars hands down. The menu selection is huge and won't break the bank.

My favorite items are the tamales (pork)with the green sauce, gorditas (gf's favorite), nopales (that's cactus and any self respecting southwestern Mexican restaurant will serve these) and the Mexican sweet breads (not brains, yuck). The food comes fast and my orders have always been right. There is a salsa bar that's always stocked. It's a dine in or take out establishment with no servers. There is also a small butcher, or carneceria, inside for finding cuts of meat for making fajitas or other tastey things at home.

Not a date place but perfect if you're looking for something with a couple of friends that will fill you up and not break the bank. It's on 12th Street and Van Buren so be aware of the area. I've lived in Central or South Phoenix my whole life so I'm used to it (aka my hood). It's open for bf, lunch & dinner. I've only had the latter two but they were muy yummy. 

Oh and also I've seen that Super Burrito and it would feed a small village ... seriously. Also, even if you're taking it to go, wander over to the dining side while you're waiting the murals on the wall are funny."
5,"Culture! Now I have had my cultural experiences in my past, and it has made me stand a little more upright and eat more with utensils. With that said, I have reached an all time high, or low (to some), by going to the Nutcracker with my GF. As I entered the Phoenix Symphony I had to wind my way thru little girls in poofy dresses and lost men with their girlfriends. The entrance is somewhat plain, but once you enter the hall you feel like you blew it by not wearing your ascot. Needless to say I was very entertained by the Nutcracker and the Ballet Dancers and Symphony were fantastic. I am very surprised that little girls don't get creeped out by the Nutcracker guy. I see that thing come to life and I'm running!

Oh yeah, now I know what the hell a Sugar Plum Fairy is too!!!"
5,We went here for a second time with all 3 of our kids last night and it was a big hit. The first time was with just our daughter who was around 1 at the time. It was a pleasant experience with good service. Last night we brought my 9 year old step daughter who is the pickiest eater I have ever seen. She ordered a noodle dish with sweet soy sauce (she tried to get it without soy sauce but the waitress convinced us it would have no flavor). When it came she made a face but then tried it and loved it! I also had some and was very impressed. It had a lot of fresh veggies and a generous amount of chicken. The veggie spring rolls were also a hit with her and my now 2.5 year old and 9 month old. It was kid friendly. The Tom Kah soup was delicious (my fiancé's favorite!) and we split the ribs which fell of the bone and were so tender. The kids fried chicken meal was generous and both kids loved it. The vegetables were all fresh. And the waitress was sweet. We will come back!
5,"Hands down the best teryaki in the world. 
i'm really not exagerating. this place is awesome. i have been going to blue fin off an on for the past 20 years. i remember as a child going to florance crittenden after getting a teriyaki bowl with half a salad. every chance i get i drop by this place.

 the teriyaki bowls are serious. not skimping on portions at all. and if you seriously off a diet, they have double meat portions. :D    i like the dark meat chicken version. drop on a heavy sprinkling of the hot powder and some black sesame seeds. OMG!!! the best in the world.  the Panko chicken is my second favorite dish. the egg rolls are great. 

the owners are always great, cheerful and ready to chat you up. i was so glad to hear this place was spared the wreaking ball. i would have chained myself to the door if it came to it. inside is cute and hasn't changed..in forever. i am serious. ever.

getting to it is tricky now. and parking is just as tricky. but its worth it. SOOOO WORTH IT"
5,"Some of the best food I've ever had! Came here last year for spring training with my girlfriend, buddy, and my little brother and it was so fun. We watched the NCAA tourny on all the big screens and their food is so good. My lil bro got those huge hot dogs. Good memories to look back on."
1,"Sure, their branding is nice. It has that feel of something hip and youthful, which helps for a chain that tries to pass itself off as a local. Pretty colors and shiny things however don't impress my palate.

I can't explain how much I detest food from Zoe's. Fresh vegetables, grilled meats -- it should be a slam dunk. Instead, their food is BLAND. It is the inverse of food, it is anti-food, annihilating the satisfaction of eating with every bite."
1,"So, I've been going to this place for years, not b/c the food blows my mind, but rather it hits the spot. Plus, I love sitting on the patio drinking wine when the weather is nice with my best gal. 

Anyhow, my other best gal, my mom had never tried this spot. I  thought Duck would be great for a quick casual lunch. She's a vegetarian so we ordered the Where's the Beef sandwich to share. It took about 20 minutes to make the sandwich, which feels like an eternity when your hungry.

When I glanced at the sandwich I thought perhaps they had added some portobello mushrooms to it. Turns out, the dark brown layer was actually rotten avocado. REALLY!!!!??? I mean come on! Avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians. How can you F this up? It was truly nasty. It got me to thinking, if someone actually put this into the sandwich, what else would their low standards allow them to place into an unsuspecting victims sammie. It's not like they make them with blindfolds on. I was really grossed out.

When I brought it to the manager's attention, she didn't seem that bothered by it. They remade half a sandwich for me, and that was that.

It was annoying b/c I left feeling that Duck & Decanter takes for granted the fact that loyal customers will stick with them no matter what. Well, not this one.

Plus, that place needs a serious dusting. Yuck."
5,"Being a guy who always perfers to have service done at the dealer for convienence, loaner cars, and recourse if there are any problems, it's just too damned expensive to do a BMW Inspection II with fluid flushes. Chapman wanted over $1,200.... Bavarian did it for under $500 and let me choose which fluids would be used on the car. 

They are friendly people with conversational skills who seem genuinely interested in making sure that you are happy with what you got. There is no pressure to get extra services that you may or may not need, and nobody is trying to sell you things that could do more harm than good, unlike *ahem* Atwood European. 

I picked up my car at the end of the day as promised, and they'd put my sunscreen in my windshiled while it was parked, and the mechanic came out to help me back out of a tight parking lot. Anyone can perform an oil change and fluid flushes, but it's the little details like being honest, helpful, and pleasant that make the difference."
5,"Been in SP for a year now and only just discovered this place on my way home tonight. Wanted something quick, tasty, and not from a fast food chain. Talk about a good stop. My sandwich was just filled with Boars Head ham, salami, cheese, delicious fresh tomatoes all on excellent toasted bread. Considering the amount of meat and the overall size of this sandwich the $7 and change price was more than reasonable. I'm already looking forward to going back here. Service was pleasant and quick considering there were two people immediately in front of me.  A unique gem in an area of SP dominated mostly by fast food joints.  Only wish they had better roadside presence so I had been able to find them sooner!"
5,"Heaven on earth.
This place has it all: good burritos, awesome salsa, cold beer, creepy mexican carnival music, and an I (heart) Huckabees Poster in the women's restroom."
5,"I'm not sure someone who is tone deaf has any business reviewing the Phoenix Symphony, but here is my unqualified take on it minus any technical critique.

It's something everyone should go to at least once, even if you think it's not for you.  And don't buy into the tales of these evildoers that wander around Yelp complaining there is no culture in Phoenix.  The musicians are talented, at least in this tone-deaf Yelper's humble opinion.

We've gone to a few performances.  The Mr. prefers the Classical series which is enjoyable even if sometimes I want to take a nap.  I prefer the Pop series.  And mixed in with this are a variety of holiday performances (the Hocus Pocus Halloween performance was really entertaining!)  On the plate for next Spring...an Elvis tribute.  Yep, I'll be there.  Also Simon & Garfunkel and McCartney/Beatles tributes, and music from the 30's & 40's.  

Now between all that and the Classical stuff, there really is something for everyone.  Also, I'm on their mailing list and recently got a 48% off if you purchased tickets within 48 hours for Hocus Pocus.  I love a good deal!  One final note.  One of the musicians has an assist dog who is darn cute and had a pumpkin cape on last time.  How can you say no to that?"
1,"TERRIBLE service, went here for breakfast and was in shock and awe at how bad our server was.  It took well over 45 minutes for us to get our food and there was only 1 other table in the restaurant.  I got our own coffee, drinks, half and half, ketchup and jam.  I will NEVER go back there again!"
1,"Too bad this is only one of two Jo-Ann Fabrics in Madison, and the only one on my side of town. I've shopped here 3 times a month all summer and this is what I've come to (sadly) expect:

1. Customer service that is apathetic at best, rude at worst. Today, for example, my (sadly, regular) cashier forgets, twice, whether I want a bag. her apology? ""Sorry. I just don't care much today."" No eye contact, no smile. This is typical of the service.

2. Three times the last month the item price that rang up was different from that listed on the shelf. I wasn't too bothered, as it rang up clearance price. When I mentioned to the cashier the clearance price was not the price listed on the shelf, she replied, ""oh,"" and stared at me blankly.

Fortunately Michael's Craft Supplies on the eastside is starting to carry more yarn and sewing items, which means I can stop the tortured visits to Jo-Ann Fabrics someday soon."
1,"A ""Cypriot"" grill that excludes halloumi from the menu cannot be run by Cypriots..!! I was very sadly disappointed. This establishment would be short-lived in Cyprus."
5,"Wow, just realized my reviews were never finished... So, this is from a year ago at Thanksgiving.  Haven't been back, but would definitely try it again.
*************
We just returned from a delish meal at Wild Thaiger, after reading all the great reviews.  I'm happy to say it didn't disappoint!  We had appetizers as well as dinner, and everything was sooooooooo tasty!  The presentation was pleasing, the portions outrageously large, and the service exceptional.  Granted, we did have the place pretty much to ourselves (being the day before Thanksgiving...).  Still, it was a great experience.  We'll definitely be back!"
1,The Jackie Evancho promotors should be strung up for putting her in this filthy dump of a theatre.  Got an email ahead of performance today reminding us to allow time to be searched.  Really.  The Pearl & ascot crowd being searched!  For Jackie Evancho!  Saw BB King here.    Everyone was smoking e cigs.  Place was filled with smoke.  Wonderful.  Obviously terribly managed !
5,"Thank god Michelle reviewed this place. She's taken me here before and IT RULED but I coudn't remember the name. I wish we had a place like Michael's even half as good in Minneapolis.

Every single time I have frozen custard it tastes like butter and, while some may find that awesome, it happens to make my gag reflex go crazy. The custard at Michael's is pretty much perfect and the root beer is SO good. I don't even like root beer that much but I would drink this stuff every day if I could.

I'm sure I'd love the K-9 custard, too. Who cares, I'm sure it's ten times better than the solid half and half a lot of places are trying to pass off as custard around here."
5,"I started visiting this place in summer of 2008. Folks are always professional and friendly. I never feel rushed at this place. I've been working with Dr. David Drewitz and he always greets with a smile, and always answers the plethora of questions I have prepared, even though I see him every 6 months. I now live in Prescott but will make special trips just to see him. Convenient location, ample parking, welcoming lobby."
5,This place was excellent. We were a little nervous because it is in a truck stop but the food was absolutely delicious and the service was fast and friendly.
1,"I've ate at OSF twice now and it was two times too many. Both times service has been horrible. I get that working the lunch shift may not be lucrative, but yesterday I was with a group of approximately 15 and our waiter was incredibly rude and disinterested in serving us. He was banking on the fact that he would get an automatic 18% from each of us, which is unfortunate because for good service I will tip more. Beyond the lousy service, the food is not good. I had the fettucini alfredo the first time I ate at OSF and it was drowning in alfredo sauce...yuck. The salad looks like something you get from a bag. Yesterday I ordered a caesar salad as my entree. First, it had tomatoes in it. I really don't like tomatoes in caesar salad. Second, our waiter brought it out with the other salads. So that meant that when my group got their entrees, I had nothing and basically had to watch them eat. Since when were entree salads brought out with starter salads??? Lastly the wine selection is pathetic. There are only two white wines by the glass and the Riesling I had yesterday was much too sweet. 

For generic Italian food, go to the Olive Garden. At least their salad and breadsticks are decent."
1,"Wow this place is the suck.  We ate there twice.  The first time the tofu was massively burned to a crisp and the second time I found a rusty fishing hook in my pasta bowl.  WTF??  I've eaten at other locations and they are just fine, but this one must have bad staff and management problems because they are the SUCK.  Stay away."
5,"having taken my share of cabs as an adult, i've happily settled on union as a first choice.

i've always hopped into a well-kept, clean, stink-free cab when ordering union. every driver i've had in the past four years has been courteous, friendly, and can tell if they should or shouldn't engage in conversation; i can't say the same for the other, long-running companies in madison.

i am at least acquaintances with more than a dozen drivers, and have heard plenty of stories (anonymous to the passenger, of course) of them going out of their way to help someone to their door, carry groceries, and get blacked-out people home safely; that last one speaks volumes...

in general, when you put your transportation needs in the hands of someone else, you're giving up a privilege, which other reviewers appear to have taken for granted. you put your wallet, time, and safety in the hands of someone else for the convenience of getting to or from somewhere without needing to rely on your own car."
5,"Awesome place to bring kids. We bought the year membership so we could come whenever we wanted and its cheaper that way, since we are here at least once a month.  Kids love forces of nature which mimics a storm, earthquake, and desert heat.  Also don't miss out on all the educational equipment on the first floor, including the daily demonstrations usually doing a science experiment.  Stop by the dorance planetarium to watch a show or the IMAX. The IMAX is fun but an extra fee, the planetarium is included with our membership (extra at membership purchase) but well worth it for the kids. They also have seasonal exhibits some free, some for an extra fee. One year they had a lego exhibit for free, the kids kept asking to go to the AZ Science Center weekly."
1,"Another review of AT&T wireless....not the store.  This may be a record; they lasted less than 2 hrs for me!  After 12 years w/Verizon I decided to leave so I could get an iPhone.  GIANT mistake.  I called to activate my phone, and was told the activation dept. is CLOSED.  I called customer service, and got it connected.  But then I called Mom and she asked why I was calling from her cell phone number?  They got the numbers attached to the WRONG PHONES.  So I called customer service back, and THEY WERE CLOSED.  It was 7pm here.  I dont care what time it was on the east coast...if their customer service dept (and tech support) cant be open when i need them, then i dont need them.  I'm going back to Verizon and im never leaving again!"
5,"Even if I didn't like the food I would still come here. The people are so friendly.
My favorite is the Panko chicken bowl with tankatsu."
1,"My worst experience with any cab company at any time in any part of the world. After being told that the cab will arrive in 10 to 20 minutes I kept waiting for 50 minutes before I was told to find alternate means of transport if I wanted to catch a flight  

My recommendation is to dump this company and find other cab service companies. 

Good bye, Yellow Cab."
