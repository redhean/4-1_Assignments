# Naive Bayes Classifier for Sentiment Analysis

You can execute this python file with no other setting.

This python file separately in 3 parts.
In the first part, I solve the "Task 1" to get 1,000 most frequently appeared words. And in the same time I train the Naive Bayes Classifier.

In the second part, I test my Naive Bayes Classifier also using Laplace Smoothing.

In the result, there are three part of result.

1. First part is the result of "Task 1" It shows the 1,000 most frequently appeared words with the number of frequency

2. Second part is the result of Naive Bayes Classifier test. It shows the Accuracy and the value of "TrueNegative", "TruePositive", "FalseNegative", "FalsePositive" each.

3. Third part is the result of Learning Curve Analysis. In this python file line 26 ~ 34, we can load the data the number as we want by using the count value. Using this I already calculate the accuracy in each cases (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 100%). It shows the graph of Learning Curve Analysis.
