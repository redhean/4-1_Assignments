#Computer_Architectures Project 2

**Single-cycle RISC-V CPU Simulator**

Read binary file and calculate the RISC-V instructions.

At the end of the execution, this program prints out the current value of the registers, and that should match with the expected output on a real RISC-V processor.


**RISC_V Instructions to Support**

add, sub, addi

xor, or, and, xori, ori, andi

slli, srli, srai, sll, srl, sra  

slti, slt

auipc, lui

jal, jalr
